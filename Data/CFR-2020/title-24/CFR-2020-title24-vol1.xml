      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:</P>
          <P>(i) Deny a person any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program or activity;</P>
          <P>(ii) Provide any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits to a person which are different, or are provided in a different manner, from those provided to others under the program or activity;</P>
          <P>(iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits under the program or activity;</P>
          <P>(iv) Restrict a person in any way in access to such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits, or in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others in connection with such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits under the program or activity;</P>
          <P>(v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any occupancy, admission, enrollment, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be provided any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program or activity;</P>
          <P>(vi) Deny a person opportunity to participate in the program or activity through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program or activity (including the opportunity to participate in the program or activity as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).</P>
          <P>(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</P>

          <P>(2)(i) A recipient, in determining the types of housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits which will be provided under any such program or activity, or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits will be provided under any such program or activity, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program or activity, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have <PRTPAGE P="9"/>the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity as respect to persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>

          <P>(ii) A recipient, in operating low-rent housing with Federal financial assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1401 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), shall assign eligible applicants to dwelling units in accordance with a plan, duly adopted by the recipient and approved by the responsible Department official, providing for assignment on a community-wide basis in sequence based upon the date and time the application is received, the size or type of unit suitable, and factors affecting preference or priority established by the recipient's regulations, which are not inconsistent with the objectives of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and this part 1. The plan may allow an applicant to refuse a tendered vacancy for good cause without losing his standing on the list but shall limit the number of refusals without cause as prescribed by the responsible Department official.</P>
          <P>(iii) The responsible Department official is authorized to prescribe and promulgate plans, exceptions, procedures, and requirements for the assignment and reassignment of eligible applicants and tenants consistent with the purpose of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this part 1, and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in order to effectuate and insure compliance with the requirements imposed thereunder.</P>

          <P>(4) As used in this part 1 the housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
          <P>(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
          <P>(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program should take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <FP>Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purpose of the Act.</FP>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program or activity to which this part 1 applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program or activity (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff, termination, upgrading, demotion, transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under such program or activity shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of <PRTPAGE P="10"/>Executive Order 11246 or any executive order which supersedes or amends it.</P>
          <P>(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part 1 tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this part 1 applies, the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part 1 to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>

In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the contract or application. The responsible Department official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance for such program or activity, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program or activity. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired through a program of Federal financial assistance the instrument effecting any disposition by the recipient of such real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interests therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain such a covenant.</P>
          <P>(3) In program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving such assistance, the nondiscrimination requirements of this part 1 shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in such space.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Preexisting contracts—funds not disbursed.</E> In any case where a contract for Federal financial assistance, to carry out a program or activity to which this part 1 applies, has been executed prior to January 3, 1965, and the funds have not been fully disbursed by the Department, the responsible Department official shall, where necessary to effectuate the purposes of this part 1, require an assurance similar to that provided in paragraph (a) of this section as <PRTPAGE P="11"/>a condition to the disbursement of further funds.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Preexisting contracts—periodic payments.</E> In any case where a contract for Federal financial assistance, to carry out a program or activity to which this part 1 applies, has been executed prior to January 3, 1965, and provides for periodic payments for the continuation of the program or activity, the recipient shall, in connection with the first application for such periodic payments on or after January 3, 1965: (1) Submit a statement that the program or activity is being conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part 1 and (2) provide such methods of administration for the program or activity as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the recipient will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part 1.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Assurances from institutions.</E> (1) In the case of any application for Federal financial assistance to an institution of higher education, the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all other practices relating to the treatment of students.</P>
          <P>(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to the institution's practices with respect to admission or other treatment of persons as students, patients, or clients of the institution or to the opportunity to participate in the provision of services or other benefits to such persons, shall be applicable to the entire institution unless the applicant establishes, to the satisfaction of the responsible Department official, that the institution's practices in designated parts or programs of the institution will in no way affect its practices in the program of the institution for which Federal financial assistance is sought, or the beneficiaries of or participants in such program. If in any such case the assistance sought is for the construction of a facility or part of a facility, the assurance shall in any event extend to the entire facility and to facilities operated in connection therewith.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Elementary and secondary schools.</E> The requirements of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible official of the Department of Health and Human Services determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part 1 within the earliest practicable time, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan.</P>

          <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> The responsible Department official or his designee shall make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part 1. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part 1 occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part .</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part 1, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part 1 may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to: (1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, <PRTPAGE P="13"/>and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 1.5.</E> If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 1.5 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to a contract therefor approved prior to January 3, 1965.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part 1, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this part 1 and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:</P>
          <P>(1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph (a) or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearing procedures.</E> Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with 24 CFR part 180.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Forms and instructions.</E> The responsible Department official shall assure that forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part are issued and promptly made available to interested persons.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Supervision and coordination.</E> The Secretary may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such department or agency, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 1.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of title VI and this part to similar programs or activities and in similar situations.

            <P>(a) In making the certification for assistance subject to Section 102(d), the Secretary will consider the aggregate amount of assistance from the Department and from other sources that is necessary to ensure the feasibility of the assisted activity. The Secretary will take into account all factors relevant to feasibility, which may include, but are not limited to, past rates of returns for owners, sponsors, and investors; the long-term needs of the project and its tenants; and the usual and customary fees charged in carrying out the assisted activity.</P>

            <P>(b) If the Department determines that the aggregate of assistance within the jurisdiction of the Department to a housing project from the Department and from other governmental sources exceeds the amount that the Secretary determines is necessary to make the assisted activity feasible, the Department will consider all options available to enable it to make the required certification, including reductions in the amount of Section 8 subsidies. The Department also may impose a dollar-for-dollar, or equivalent, reduction in the amount of HUD assistance to offset the amount of other government assistance. In grant programs, this could result in a reduction of any grant amounts not yet drawn down. The Department may make these adjustments immediately, or in conjunction with servicing actions anticipated to occur in the near future (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in conjunction with the next annual adjustment of Section 8 rents).</P>
            <P>(c) If an applicant does not meet the $200,000 disclosure requirement in § 4.7(b), an applicant must certify whether there is, or is expected to be made, available with respect to the housing project any other governmental assistance. The Department may also require any applicant subject to this subpart A to submit such a certification in conjunction with the Department's processing of any subsequent servicing action on that project. If there is other government assistance for purposes of the two preceding sentences, the applicant must submit such information as the Department deems necessary to make the certification and subsequent adjustments under Section 102(d).</P>
            <P>(d) The certification under Section 102(d) shall be retained in the official file for the housing project.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The provisions of this subpart B are authorized under section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989) (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (hereinafter, Section 103). Both the provisions of Section 103 and this subpart B apply for the purposes of Section 103. Section 103 proscribes direct or indirect communication of certain information during the selection process by HUD employees to persons within or outside of the Department who are not authorized to receive that information. The purpose of the proscription is to preclude giving an unfair advantage to applicants who would receive information not available to other applicants or to the public. Section 103 also authorizes the Department to impose a civil money penalty on a HUD employee who knowingly discloses protected information, if such a violation of Section 103 is material, and authorizes the Department to sanction the person who received information improperly by, among other things, denying assistance to that person.</P>

            <P>(b) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is no reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it shall close the matter and send its determination to the Office of Inspector General.</P>
            <P>(c) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Send its determination to the Office of Inspector General; and</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the matter to the appropriate official for review as to whether to impose a civil money penalty in accordance with 24 CFR part 30; provided, however, that the Ethics Law Division shall not make a civil money penalty recommendation unless it finds the violation to have been knowing and material. The decision to impose a civil money penalty in a particular matter may be made only upon referral from the Ethics Law Division.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining whether a violation is material, the Ethics Law Division shall consider the following factors, as applicable:</P>

            <P>(7) The potential injury to the Department.</P>
            <P>(e) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it may, in addition to referring the matter under 24 CFR part 30, refer the matter to an appropriate HUD official for consideration of any other available disciplinary action.

            <P>(b) In determining whether a sanction is appropriate and if so which sanction or sanctions should be sought, <PRTPAGE P="38"/>the Secretary shall give consideration to the applicant's conduct with respect to the violation.

            <SUBJECT>Equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> Consistent with Executive Order 13279 (issued on December 12, 2002, 67 FR 77141), entitled “Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations,” as amended by Executive Order 13559 (issued on November 17, 2010, 75 FR 71319), entitled “Fundamental Principles and Policymaking Criteria for Partnerships With Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations,” this section describes requirements for ensuring the equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities. These requirements apply to all HUD programs and activities, including all of HUD's Native American Programs, except as <PRTPAGE P="45"/>may be otherwise noted in the respective program regulations in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), or unless inconsistent with certain HUD program authorizing statutes.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Direct Federal financial assistance</E> means Federal financial assistance provided when a Federal Government agency or an intermediary, as defined in this section, selects the provider and either purchases services from that provider (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> via a contract) or awards funds to that provider to carry out an activity (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via grant, sub-grant, sub-award, or cooperative agreement). The recipients of sub-grants or sub-awards that receive Federal financial assistance through State-administered programs (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> flow-through programs) are considered recipients of direct Federal financial assistance. In general, Federal financial assistance shall be treated as direct, unless it meets the definition of indirect Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Federal financial assistance</E> means assistance that non-Federal entities receive or administer in the forms of grants, contracts, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, food commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance, but does not include a tax credit, deduction, or exemption.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Indirect Federal financial assistance</E> means Federal financial assistance provided when the choice of the provider is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is considered indirect when the Government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment is neutral toward religion; the organization receives the assistance as a result of a decision of the beneficiary, not a decision of the Government; and the beneficiary has at least one adequate secular option for the use of the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Intermediary</E> means an entity, including a nongovernmental organization, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State, tribal or local government that accepts Federal financial assistance and distributes that assistance to other entities that, in turn, carry out activities under HUD programs.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities.</E> Faith-based organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in HUD programs and activities. Neither the Federal Government, nor a State, tribal or local government, nor any other entity that administers any HUD program or activity, shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation, or lack thereof. In addition, decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not based on the religious character or affiliation, or lack thereof, of an organization.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Separation of explicitly religious activities from direct Federal financial assistance.</E>
            </P>

            <P>(1) A faith-based organization that applies for, or participates in, a HUD program or activity supported with Federal financial assistance retains its independence and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct Federal financial assistance that it receives (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> via contract, grant, sub-grant, sub-award or cooperative agreement) to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), or in any other manner prohibited by law.</P>

            <P>(2) A faith-based organization that receives direct Federal financial assistance may use space (including a sanctuary, chapel, prayer hall, or other space) in its facilities (including a temple, synagogue, church, mosque, or <PRTPAGE P="46"/>other place of worship) to carry out activities under a HUD program without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a faith-based organization participating in a HUD program or activity retains its authority over its internal governance, and may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Explicitly religious activities.</E> If an organization engages in explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), the explicitly religious activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of the programs or activities that receive direct Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Intermediary responsibilities to ensure equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs.</E> If an intermediary—acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State, tribal or local government that is administering a program supported by Federal financial assistance—is given the authority to select a nongovernmental organization to receive Federal financial assistance under a contract, grant, sub-grant, sub-award, or cooperative agreement, the intermediary must ensure that such organization complies with the requirements of this section. If the intermediary is a nongovernmental organization, it retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under the program's statutory and regulatory provisions.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Beneficiary protections.</E> Faith-based organizations that carry out programs or activities with direct Federal financial assistance from HUD must give written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of the programs or activities describing certain protections available to them, as provided in this subsection. In addition, if a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization carrying out the programs or activities, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no such objection.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Written notice.</E> The written notice must state that:</P>
            <P>(i) The organization may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion, religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;</P>
            <P>(ii) The organization may not require beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;</P>
            <P>(iii) The organization must separate, in time or location, any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;</P>
            <P>(iv) If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization must undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no such objection; and</P>
            <P>(v) Beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries may report an organization's violation of these protections, including any denial of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint to HUD or the intermediary, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of notice.</E> The written notice must be given to prospective beneficiaries before they enroll in any HUD program or activity. When the nature of the program or activity or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide the written notice in advance, the organization must provide written notice to beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Referral requirements.</E> (i) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of a program or activity that receives direct Federal financial assistance from HUD objects to the religious character of an organization that carries out the <PRTPAGE P="47"/>program or activity, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no such objection.</P>
            <P>(ii) A referral may be made to another faith-based organization, if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection to that provider based on the provider's religious character. But if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests a secular provider, and a secular provider is available, then a referral must be made to that provider.</P>
            <P>(iii) Except for activities carried out by telephone, Internet, or similar means, the referral must be to an alternative provider that is in reasonable geographic proximity to the organization making the referral and that carries out activities that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization. The alternative provider also must have the capacity to accept additional beneficiaries.</P>
            <P>(iv) If the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization shall promptly notify the intermediary or, if there is no intermediary, HUD. If HUD or an intermediary is notified that an organization is unable to identify an alternative provider, HUD or the intermediary, as appropriate, shall promptly determine whether there is any other suitable alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may be referred. An intermediary that receives a request for assistance in identifying an alternative provider may request assistance from HUD.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> A faith-based organization providing a referral under paragraph (g)(3) of this section must document a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary's request for a referral, whether the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary was referred to another provider, to which provider the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary was referred, and if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary contacted the alternative provider, unless the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests no follow up.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination requirements.</E> Any organization that receives Federal financial assistance under a HUD program or activity shall not, in providing services or carrying out activities with such assistance, discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion, religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, this section does not require any organization that only receives indirect Federal financial assistance to modify its program or activities to accommodate a beneficiary that selects the organization to receive indirect aid.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements.</E> A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1), is not forfeited when the organization participates in a HUD program. Some HUD programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions that impose certain nondiscrimination requirements on all grantees. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of structures.</E> Direct Federal financial assistance may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under a HUD program or activity. Where a structure is used for both eligible and explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), direct Federal financial assistance may not exceed the cost of the share of acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to the HUD program or activity. However, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a HUD-funded faith-based organization uses as its principal place of worship, <PRTPAGE P="48"/>may not be paid with direct Federal financial assistance. Disposition of real property by a faith-based organization after its use for an authorized purpose, or any change in use of the property from an authorized purpose, is subject to Government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (2 CFR part 200, subpart D) and the HUD program regulations, as directed by HUD.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Commingling of Federal and State, tribal, and local funds.</E> If a State, tribal, or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement direct Federal financial assistance for an activity, the State, tribal or local government has the option to segregate those funds or commingle them with the direct Federal financial assistance. However, if the funds are commingled, the requirements of this section apply to all of the commingled funds. Further, if a State, tribal, or local government is required to contribute matching funds to supplement direct Federal financial assistance for an activity, the matching funds are considered commingled with the direct Federal financial assistance and, therefore, subject to the requirements of this section. Some HUD programs' requirements govern any activity assisted under those programs. Accordingly, recipients should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing: Purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Pursuant to the affirmatively furthering fair housing mandate in section 808(e)(5) of the Fair Housing Act, and in subsequent legislative enactments, the purpose of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulations in §§ 5.150 through 5.180 is to provide program participants with an effective planning approach to aid program participants in taking meaningful actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination. The regulations establish specific requirements for the development and submission of an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) by program participants (including local governments, States, and public housing agencies (PHAs)), and the incorporation and implementation of that AFH into subsequent consolidated plans and PHA Plans in a manner that connects housing and community development policy <PRTPAGE P="49"/>and investment planning with meaningful actions that affirmatively further fair housing. A program participant's strategies and actions must affirmatively further fair housing and may include various activities, such as developing affordable housing, and removing barriers to the development of such housing, in areas of high opportunity; strategically enhancing access to opportunity, including through: Targeted investment in neighborhood revitalization or stabilization; preservation or rehabilitation of existing affordable housing; promoting greater housing choice within or outside of areas of concentrated poverty and greater access to areas of high opportunity; and improving community assets such as quality schools, employment, and transportation.</P>

              <P>Section 5.160 of the AFH regulations provides the date by which program participants must submit their first AFH. A program participant's AFH submission date is the date by which the program participant must comply with the regulations in §§ 5.150 through 5.180. Until such time, the program participant shall continue to conduct an analysis of impediments, as required of the program participant under one or more of the HUD programs listed in § 5.154, in accordance with requirements in effect prior to August 17, 2015.</P>

              <P>For purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.180, the terms “consolidated plan,” “consortium,” “unit of general local government,” “jurisdiction,” and “State” are defined in 24 CFR part 91. For PHAs, “jurisdiction” is defined in 24 CFR 982.4. The following additional definitions are provided solely for purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.180 and related amendments in 24 CFR parts 91, 92, 570, 574, 576, and 903:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Affirmatively furthering fair housing</E> means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. The duty to affirmatively further fair housing extends to all of a program participant's activities and programs relating to housing and urban development.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Assessment of Fair Housing (assessment or AFH</E>) means the analysis undertaken pursuant to § 5.154 that includes an analysis of fair housing data, an assessment of fair housing issues and contributing factors, and an identification of fair housing priorities and goals, and is conducted and submitted to HUD using the Assessment Tool. The AFH may be conducted and submitted by an individual program participant (individual AFH), or may be a single AFH conducted and submitted by two or more program participants (joint AFH) or two or more program participants, where at least two of which are consolidated plan program participants (regional AFH).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Assessment Tool</E> refers collectively to any forms or templates and the accompanying instructions provided by HUD that program participants must use to conduct and submit an AFH pursuant to § 5.154. HUD may provide different Assessment Tools for different types of program participants. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) (PRA), the Assessment Tool will be subject to periodic notice and opportunity to comment in order to maintain the approval of the Assessment Tool as granted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PRA.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Community participation,</E> as required in § 5.158, means a solicitation of views and recommendations from members of the community and other interested parties, a consideration of the views and recommendations received, and a process for incorporating such views and recommendations into decisions and outcomes. For HUD regulations <PRTPAGE P="50"/>implementing the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the statutory term for “community participation” is “citizen participation,” and, therefore, the regulations in 24 CFR parts 91, 92, 570, 574, and 576 use this term.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Consolidated plan program participant</E> means any entity specified in § 5.154(b)(1).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Contributing factor.</E> See definition of “fair housing contributing factor” in this section.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Data.</E> The term “data” refers collectively to the sources of data provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition. When identification of the specific source of data in paragraph (1) or (2) is necessary, the specific source (HUD-provided data or local data) will be stated.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">HUD-provided data.</E> As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, the term “HUD-provided data” refers to HUD-provided metrics, statistics, and other quantified information required to be used with the Assessment Tool. HUD-provided data will not only be provided to program participants but will be posted on HUD's Web site for availability to all of the public;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Local data.</E> As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, the term “local data” refers to metrics, statistics, and other quantified information, subject to a determination of statistical validity by HUD, relevant to the program participant's geographic areas of analysis, that can be found through a reasonable amount of search, are readily available at little or no cost, and are necessary for the completion of the AFH using the Assessment Tool.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Disability.</E> (1) The term “disability” means, with respect to an individual:</P>
              <P>(i) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;</P>
              <P>(ii) A record of such an impairment; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Being regarded as having such an impairment.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “disability” as used herein shall be interpreted consistent with the definition of such term under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. This definition does not change the definition of “disability” or “disabled person” adopted pursuant to a HUD program statute for purposes of determining an individual's eligibility to participate in a housing program that serves a specified population.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Disproportionate housing needs</E> refers to a condition in which there are significant disparities in the proportion of members of a protected class experiencing a category of housing need when compared to the proportion of members of any other relevant groups or the total population experiencing that category of housing need in the applicable geographic area. For purposes of this definition, categories of housing need are based on such factors as cost burden, severe cost burden, overcrowding, and substandard housing conditions, as those terms are applied in the Assessment Tool.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fair housing choice</E> means that individuals and families have the information, opportunity, and options to live where they choose without unlawful discrimination and other barriers related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability. Fair housing choice encompasses:</P>
              <P>(1) Actual choice, which means the existence of realistic housing options;</P>
              <P>(2) Protected choice, which means housing that can be accessed without discrimination; and</P>
              <P>(3) Enabled choice, which means realistic access to sufficient information regarding options so that any choice is informed. For persons with disabilities, fair housing choice and access to opportunity include access to accessible housing and housing in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs as required under Federal civil rights law, including disability-related services that an individual needs to live in such housing.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fair housing contributing factor (or contributing factor)</E> means a factor that creates, contributes to, perpetuates, or increases the severity of one or more fair housing issues. Goals in an AFH are designed to overcome one or more contributing factors and related fair housing issues, as provided in § 5.154.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fair housing issue</E> means a condition in a program participant's geographic <PRTPAGE P="51"/>area of analysis that restricts fair housing choice or access to opportunity, and includes such conditions as ongoing local or regional segregation or lack of integration, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, significant disparities in access to opportunity, disproportionate housing needs, and evidence of discrimination or violations of civil rights law or regulations related to housing. Participation in “housing programs serving specified populations,” as defined in this section, does not present a fair housing issue of segregation, provided that such programs are administered by program participants so that the programs comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity</E> means the ability of a jurisdiction, and organizations located in the jurisdiction, to accept complaints of violations of fair housing laws, investigate such complaints, obtain remedies, engage in fair housing testing, and educate community members about fair housing laws and rights. This definition covers any State or local agency that enforces a law substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act (see 24 CFR part 115) and any organization participating in the Fair Housing Initiative Programs (see 24 CFR part 125).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Geographic area</E> means a jurisdiction, region, State, Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA), or another applicable area (e.g., census tract, neighborhood, Zip code, block group, housing development, or portion thereof) relevant to the analysis required to complete the assessment of fair housing, as specified in the Assessment Tool.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Housing programs serving specified populations.</E> Housing programs serving specified populations are HUD and Federal housing programs, including designations in the programs, as applicable, such as HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, homeless assistance programs under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11301 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and housing designated under section 7 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437e), that:</P>
              <P>(1) Serve specific identified populations; and</P>

              <P>(2) Comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Insular area</E> has the same meaning as provided in § 570.405.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Integration</E> means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, as guided by the Assessment Tool, in which there is not a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a particular type of disability when compared to a broader geographic area. For individuals with disabilities, integration also means that such individuals are able to access housing and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs. The most integrated setting is one that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with persons without disabilities to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B (addressing 28 CFR 35.130 and providing guidance on the American with Disabilities Act regulation on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Joint participants</E> refers to two or more program participants conducting and submitting a single AFH (a joint AFH), in accordance with § 5.156 and 24 CFR 903.15(a)(1) and (2), as applicable.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Local knowledge.</E> As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, local <PRTPAGE P="52"/>knowledge means information to be provided by the program participant that relates to the participant's geographic areas of analysis and that is relevant to the program participant's AFH, is known or becomes known to the program participant, and is necessary for the completion of the AFH using the Assessment Tool.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Meaningful actions</E> means significant actions that are designed and can be reasonably expected to achieve a material positive change that affirmatively furthers fair housing by, for example, increasing fair housing choice or decreasing disparities in access to opportunity.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Program participants</E> means any entities specified in § 5.154(b).</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Protected characteristics</E> are race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, having a disability, and having a type of disability.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Protected class</E> means a group of persons who have the same protected characteristic; e.g., a group of persons who are of the same race are a protected class. Similarly, a person who has a mobility disability is a member of the protected class of persons with disabilities and a member of the protected class of persons with mobility disabilities.</P>

                <E T="03">Segregation</E> means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, as guided by the Assessment Tool, in which there is a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a type of disability in a particular geographic area when compared to a broader geographic area. For persons with disabilities, segregation includes a condition in which the housing or services are not in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). (See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B, addressing 25 CFR 35.130.) Participation in “housing programs serving specified populations” as defined in this section does not present a fair housing issue of segregation, provided that such programs are administered to comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs): The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing: section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, <E T="03">et seq.</E>); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To develop a successful affirmatively furthering fair housing strategy, it is central to assess the elements and factors that cause, increase, contribute to, maintain, or perpetuate segregation, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, significant <PRTPAGE P="53"/>disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs. For HUD program participants already required to develop plans for effective uses of HUD funds consistent with the statutory requirements and goals governing such funds, an AFH will be integrated into such plans.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirement to submit an AFH.</E> In furtherance of the statutory obligation to affirmatively further fair housing, an AFH must be developed following the AFH consultation, content, and submission requirements described in §§ 5.150 through 5.180, and submitted in a manner and form prescribed by HUD by the following entities:</P>
              <P>(1) Jurisdictions and Insular Areas that are required to submit consolidated plans for the following programs:</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fair housing data.</E> Program participants will use HUD-provided data, as defined within the definition of “data” in § 5.152, and supplement the HUD-provided data, as needed, with local data and local knowledge, as guided by the Assessment Tool.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Content.</E> Using the Assessment Tool prescribed by HUD, each program participant shall conduct an AFH for the purpose of examining its programs, jurisdiction, and region, and identifying goals to affirmatively further fair housing and to inform fair housing strategies in the consolidated plan, annual action plan, the PHA Plan and any other plan incorporated therein, and community plans including, but not limited to, education, transportation, or environmental related plans. The AFH's analysis, goals, and priorities will address integration and segregation; racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty; disparities in access to opportunity; and disproportionate housing needs based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. The AFH will assess the jurisdiction's fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity. At a minimum, the AFH will include the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Summary of fair housing issues and capacity.</E> The AFH must include a summary of fair housing issues in the jurisdiction, including any findings, lawsuits, enforcement actions, settlements, or judgments related to fair housing or other civil rights laws, an assessment of compliance with existing fair housing laws and regulations, and an assessment of the jurisdiction's fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Analysis of data.</E> Using HUD-provided data, local data, local knowledge, including information gained through community participation, and the Assessment Tool, the program participant will undertake the analysis required by this section. This analysis will address the following to the extent the data or local knowledge are informative of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Identification of integration and segregation patterns and trends based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability within the jurisdiction and region;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identification of racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty within the jurisdiction and region;</P>
              <P>(iii) Identification of significant disparities in access to opportunity for any protected class within the jurisdiction and region; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Identification of disproportionate housing needs for any protected class within the jurisdiction and region.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Assessment of fair housing issues.</E> Using the Assessment Tool provided by HUD, the AFH will identify the contributing factors for segregation, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs as identified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Identification of fair housing priorities and goals.</E> Consistent with the identification of fair housing issues, <PRTPAGE P="54"/>and the analysis and assessment conducted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section, the AFH must:</P>
              <P>(i) Identify and discuss the fair housing issues arising from the assessment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Identify significant contributing factors, prioritize such factors, and justify the prioritization of the contributing factors that will be addressed in the program participant's fair housing goals. In prioritizing contributing factors, program participants shall give highest priority to those factors that limit or deny fair housing choice or access to opportunity, or negatively impact fair housing or civil rights compliance; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Set goals for overcoming the effects of contributing factors as prioritized in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. For each goal, a program participant must identify one or more contributing factors that the goal is designed to address, describe how the goal relates to overcoming the identified contributing factor(s) and related fair housing issue(s), and identify the metrics and milestones for determining what fair housing results will be achieved. For instance, where segregation in a development or geographic area is determined to be a fair housing issue, with at least one significant contributing factor, HUD would expect the AFH to include one or more goals to reduce the segregation.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Strategies and actions.</E> To implement goals and priorities in an AFH, strategies and actions shall be included in program participants' consolidated plans, Annual Action Plans, and PHA Plans (including any plans incorporated therein), and need not be reflected in their AFH. Strategies and actions must affirmatively further fair housing and may include, but are not limited to, enhancing mobility strategies and encouraging development of new affordable housing in areas of opportunity, as well as place-based strategies to encourage community revitalization, including preservation of existing affordable housing, including HUD-assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Summary of community participation.</E> The AFH must include a concise summary of the community participation process, public comments, and efforts made to broaden community participation in the development of the AFH; a summary of the comments, views, and recommendations, received in writing, or orally at public hearings, during the community participation process; and a summary of any comments, views, and recommendations not accepted by the program participant and the reasons for nonacceptance.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Review of progress achieved since submission of prior AFH.</E> For each AFH submitted after the first AFH submission, the program participant will provide a summary of progress achieved in meeting the goals and associated metrics and milestones of the prior AFH, and identify any barriers that impeded or prevented achievement of goals.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Joint and Regional AFHs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> For the purposes of sharing resources and addressing fair housing issues from a broader perspective, program participants are encouraged to collaborate to conduct and submit a single AFH, either a joint AFH or regional AFH (as defined in § 5.152), for the purpose of evaluating fair housing issues and contributing factors.</P>
              <P>(1) Collaborating program participants, whether joint participants or regionally collaborating participants, need not be located in contiguous jurisdictions and may cross State boundaries, provided that the collaborating program participants are located within the same Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA), as defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) at the time of submission of the joint or regional AFH.</P>
              <P>(2) Program participants, whether contiguous or noncontiguous, that are either not located within the same CBSA or that are not located within the same State and seek to collaborate on an AFH, must submit a written request to HUD for approval of the collaboration, stating why the collaboration is appropriate. The collaboration may proceed upon approval by HUD.</P>

              <P>(3) Collaborating program participants must designate, through express written consent, one participant as the lead entity to oversee the submission <PRTPAGE P="55"/>of the joint or regional AFH on behalf of all collaborating program participants. When collaborating to submit a joint or regional AFH, program participants may divide work as they choose, but all program participants are accountable for the analysis and any joint goals and priorities, and each collaborating program participant must sign the AFH submitted to HUD. Collaborating program participants are also accountable for their individual analysis, goals, and priorities to be included in the collaborative AFH.</P>
              <P>(4) Program participants that intend to prepare either a joint or regional AFH shall promptly notify HUD of such intention and provide HUD with a copy of their written agreement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordinating program years and submission deadlines.</E> (1) To the extent practicable, all collaborating program participants must be on the same program year and fiscal year (as applicable) before submission of the joint AFH or regional AFH. (See § 5.160 and 24 CFR 91.10 and 903.5.) The applicable procedures for changing consolidated plan program participant program year start dates, if necessary, are described in 24 CFR 91.10. The applicable procedures for changing PHA fiscal year beginning dates, if necessary, are described in 24 CFR part 903.</P>
              <P>(2) If alignment of a program year or fiscal year is not practicable, the submission deadline for a joint AFH or regional AFH must be based on the designated lead entity's program year start date or fiscal year beginning date (as applicable), as provided in § 5.160(c). Within 12 months after the date of AFH acceptance, each collaborating program participant that has a program year start date, or fiscal year beginning date, earlier than the designated lead entity must make appropriate revisions to its full consolidated plan (as described in § 91.15(b)(2) of this chapter), or PHA Plan and any plan incorporated therein, to incorporate strategies and proposed actions consistent with the fair housing goals, issues, and other elements identified in the joint AFH or regional AFH.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures for withdrawal from a joint or regional collaboration.</E> A program participant that, for any reason, decides to withdraw from a previously arranged collaborative AFH must promptly notify HUD of the withdrawal. HUD will work with the withdrawing program participant, as well as the remaining collaborative participants, to determine whether a new submission date is needed for the withdrawing participant or the remaining participants. If a new submission date is needed for the withdrawing participant or the remaining participants, HUD will establish a submission date that is as close as feasible to the originally intended submission date and is no later than the original joint or regional submission date unless good cause for an extension is shown.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Community participation.</E> Collaborating program participants must have a plan for community participation that complies with the requirements of §§ 5.150 through 5.180. The community participation process must include residents, and other interested members of the public, in the jurisdictions of each collaborating program participant, and not just those of the lead entity. In addition, the community participation process must be conducted in a manner sufficient for each consolidated plan program participant collaborating in a joint AFH or regional AFH to certify that it is following its applicable citizen participation plan, and for each PHA, collaborating in a joint AFH or regional AFH, to satisfy the notice and comment requirements in 24 CFR part 903. To the extent that public notice and comment periods provided in §§ 5.150 through 5.180 or in the consolidated plan or PHA plan regulations differ, the longer period shall apply. A material change that requires any collaborating program participant to revise its AFH pursuant to § 5.164(a)(1) will trigger a requirement to revise the joint or regional AFH.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Content of the joint or regional AFH.</E> A joint or regional AFH must include the elements required under § 5.154(d). A joint or regional AFH does not relieve each collaborating program participant from its obligation to analyze and address local and regional fair housing issues and contributing factors that affect housing choice, and to set priorities and goals for its geographic <PRTPAGE P="56"/>area to overcome the effects of contributing factors and related fair housing issues.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Community participation, consultation, and coordination.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> To ensure that the AFH is informed by meaningful community participation, program participants must give the public reasonable opportunities for involvement in the development of the AFH and in the incorporation of the AFH into the consolidated plan, PHA Plan, and other required planning documents. To ensure that the AFH, the consolidated plan, and the PHA Plan and any plan incorporated therein are informed by meaningful community participation, program participants should employ communications means designed to reach the broadest audience. Such communications may be met, as appropriate, by publishing a summary of each document in one or more newspapers of general circulation, and by making copies of each document available on the Internet, on the program participant's official government Web site, and as well at libraries, government offices, and public places. Program participants shall ensure that all aspects of community participation are conducted in accordance with fair housing and civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 1; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, as applicable. At a minimum, whether a program participant is preparing an AFH individually or in combination with other program participants, AFH community participation must include the following for consolidated plan program participants and PHAs (as applicable):</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Consolidated plan program participants.</E> The consolidated plan program participant must follow the policies and procedures described in its applicable citizen participation plan, adopted pursuant to 24 CFR part 91 (see 24 CFR 91.105, 91.115, and 91.401), in the process of developing the AFH, obtaining community feedback, and addressing complaints. The jurisdiction must consult with the agencies and organizations identified in consultation requirements at 24 CFR part 91 (see 24 CFR 91.100, 91.110, and 91.235).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">PHAs.</E> PHAs must follow the policies and procedures described in 24 CFR 903.13, 903.15, 903.17, and 903.19 in the process of developing the AFH, obtaining Resident Advisory Board and community feedback, and addressing complaints.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> (1) As described in 903.15, a PHA may fulfill its responsibility to conduct an AFH by:</P>
              <P>(i) Participating with a consolidated plan program participant, including State jurisdictions; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Participating with one or more PHAs in the planning, and preparation of the AFH; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Preparing its own AFH.</P>
              <P>(2) When working with other program participants, PHAs are encouraged to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process of the program participants, in the creation of the AFH.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions to the first submission deadline for recently completed Regional Analysis of Impediments (RAI).</E> An entitlement jurisdiction subject to the submission deadline in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not required to submit an AFH by the deadline specified in such paragraph if the entitlement jurisdiction has completed a HUD-approved RAI in accordance with a grant awarded under HUD's FY 2010 or 2011 Sustainable Communities Competition and submitted the RAI within 30 months prior to the date when the program participant's AFH is due as provided under this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance with existing requirements until first AFH submission.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, until such time as program participants are required to submit an AFH, the program participant shall continue to conduct an analysis of impediments, as required of the program participant by one or more of the HUD programs listed in § 5.154, in accordance with requirements in effect prior to August 17, 2015.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">New program participants.</E> For a new program participant that has not submitted a consolidated plan or PHA plan as of August 17, 2015, HUD will provide the new program participant with a deadline for submission of its first AFH and the strategies and actions to implement an accepted AFH, which shall be incorporated into the program participant's consolidated plan or PHA plan, as applicable, within 18 months of the start date of its first program year or fiscal year, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Second and subsequent AFHs.</E> After the first AFH, for all program participants, subsequent AFHs are due 195 calendar days before the start of the first year of the next 3 to 5-year cycle (as applicable), as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; that is, the subsequent AFH is to precede the next strategic plan under 24 CFR 91.15(b)(2) or 5-year plan under 24 CFR 903.5.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Collaborative AFHs.</E> All collaborative program participants, whether joint participants or regionally collaborating participants, will select a lead entity and submit the AFH according to that entity's schedule.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Frequency.</E> All program participants shall submit an AFH no less frequently than once every 5 years, or at such time agreed upon in writing by HUD and the program participant, in order to coordinate the AFH submission with time frames used for consolidated plans, participation in a regional AFH, cooperation agreements, PHA Plans, or other plans. (See 24 CFR 91.15(b)(2) and 903.15.)</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification.</E> Each program participant, including program participants submitting a joint or regional AFH, must certify that it will take meaningful actions to further the goals identified in its AFH conducted in accordance with the requirements in §§ 5.150 through 5.180 and 24 CFR 91.225(a)(1), 91.325(a)(1), 91.425(a)(1), 570.487(b)(1), 570.601, 903.7(o), and 903.15(d), as applicable. The certification will be required at the time a program participant submits its first AFH and for each AFH thereafter. If a PHA Plan, consolidated plan, Action Plan, or other submission requiring a civil rights-related certification is due prior to the time of submission of the AFH, the participant will complete a certification, in a form provided by HUD, that it will affirmatively further fair housing, or complete <PRTPAGE P="58"/>such other certification that HUD may require in accordance with applicable program regulations in effect before August 17, 2015.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review and acceptance of AFH</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> HUD's review of an AFH is to determine whether the program participant has met the requirements for providing its analysis, assessment, and goal setting, as set forth in § 5.154(d). The AFH will be deemed accepted after 60 calendar days after the date that HUD receives the AFH, unless on or before that date, HUD has provided notification that HUD does not accept the AFH. In its notification, HUD will inform the program participant in writing of the reasons why HUD has not accepted the AFH and the actions that the program participant may take to resolve the nonacceptance.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Meaning of “acceptance”.</E> HUD's acceptance of an AFH means only that, for purposes of administering HUD program funding, HUD has determined that the program participant has provided an AFH that meets the required elements, as set forth in § 5.154(d). Acceptance does not mean that the program participant has complied with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing under the Fair Housing Act; has complied with other provisions of the Fair Housing Act; or has complied with other civil rights laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonacceptance of an AFH.</E> (1) HUD will not accept an AFH if HUD finds that the AFH or a portion of the AFH is inconsistent with fair housing or civil rights requirements or is substantially incomplete. In connection with a regional or joint AFH, HUD's determination to not accept the AFH with respect to one program participant does not necessarily affect the acceptance of the AFH with respect to another program participant.</P>
              <P>(i) The following are examples of an AFH that is inconsistent with fair housing and civil rights requirements:</P>
              <P>(A) HUD determines that the analysis of fair housing issues, fair housing contributing factors, goals, or priorities contained in the AFH would result in policies or practices that would operate to discriminate in violation of the Fair Housing Act or other civil rights laws;</P>
              <P>(B) The AFH does not identify policies or practices as fair housing contributing factors, even though they result in the exclusion of a protected class from areas of opportunity.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following are examples of an AFH that is substantially incomplete:</P>
              <P>(A) The AFH was developed without the required community participation or the required consultation;</P>
              <P>(B) The AFH fails to satisfy a required element in §§ 5.150 through 5.180. Failure to satisfy a required element includes an assessment in which priorities or goals are materially inconsistent with the data or other evidence available to the program participant or in which priorities or goals are not designed to overcome the effects of contributing factors and related fair housing issues.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD will provide written notification to the program participant, including each program participant involved in a collaborative AFH (joint or regional AFH), of HUD's nonacceptance of the AFH and the written notification will specify the reasons why the AFH was not accepted and will provide guidance on how the AFH should be revised in order to be accepted.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Revisions and resubmission.</E> HUD will provide a program participant, including each program participant involved in a collaborative AFH, with a time period to revise and resubmit the AFH, which shall be no less than 45 calendar days after the date on which HUD provides written notification that it does not accept the AFH. The revised AFH will be deemed accepted after 30 calendar days of the date by which HUD receives the revised AFH, unless on or before that date HUD has provided notification that HUD does not accept the revised AFH.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Accepted AFH as requirement for consolidated plan and PHA Plan approval.</E> If a program participant does not have an accepted AFH, HUD will disapprove a consolidated plan (see 24 CFR 91.500) or a PHA Plan (see 24 CFR 903.23) except where delayed submission is otherwise permitted under § 5.156 or § 5.160.<PRTPAGE P="59"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) If a consolidated plan program participant fails to submit an AFH as required by § 5.160, HUD may establish an alternative date for the jurisdiction to submit its consolidated plan, but in no event past the August 16 deadline provided in 24 CFR 91.15. Failure to submit a consolidated plan by August 16 of the Federal fiscal year for which funds are appropriated will automatically result in the loss of the CDBG funds to which the jurisdiction would otherwise be entitled.</P>
              <P>(2) If a PHA fails to submit the AFH in accordance with § 5.160, the PHA must have an accepted AFH no later than 75 calendar days before the commencement of the PHA's fiscal year to avoid any potential impacts on funding.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General</E>—(1) <E T="03">Minimum criteria for revising the AFH.</E> An AFH previously accepted by HUD must be revised and submitted to HUD for review under the following circumstances:</P>

              <P>(i) A material change occurs. A material change is a change in circumstances in the jurisdiction of a program participant that affects the information on which the AFH is based to the extent that the analysis, the fair housing contributing factors, or the priorities and goals of the AFH no longer reflect actual circumstances. Examples include Presidentially declared disasters, under title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), in the program participant's area that are of such a nature as to significantly impact the steps a program participant may need to take to affirmatively further fair housing; significant demographic changes; new significant contributing factors in the participant's jurisdiction; and civil rights findings, determinations, settlements (including Voluntary Compliance Agreements), or court orders; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon HUD's written notification specifying a material change that requires the revision.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Criteria for revising the AFH.</E> The criteria that will be used in determining when revisions to the AFH are appropriate must be specified in the citizen participation plan adopted under the consolidated plan pursuant to 24 CFR part 91, and the public participation procedures and significant amendment process required under 24 CFR part 903. Such criteria must include, at a minimum, the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Revised AFH.</E> A revision pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section consists of preparing and submitting amended analyses, assessments, priorities, and goals that take into account the material change, including any new fair housing issues and contributing factors that may arise as a result of the material change. A revision may not necessarily require the submission of an entirely new AFH.

Independent verification of information obtained from a SWICA or a Federal agency may be:</P>
              <P>(i) By HUD;</P>

              <P>(i) HUD or, as applicable or directed by HUD, the PHA shall request the undisclosed employer or other income source to furnish any information necessary to establish an assistance applicant's or participant's eligibility for or level of assistance in a covered program. This information shall be furnished in writing, as directed to:</P>
              <P>(A) HUD, with respect to programs under parts 221, 235, 236, or 290 of this title;</P>
              <P>(B) The responsible entity (as defined in § 5.100) in the case of the public housing program or any Section 8 program.</P>

              <P>(ii) HUD or the PHA may verify the income information directly with an assistance applicant or participant. Such verification procedures shall not include any disclosure of income information prohibited under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) HUD and the PHA shall not be required to pursue these verification procedures when the sums of money at issue are too small to raise an inference of fraud or justify the expense of independent verification and the procedures related to termination, denial, suspension, or reduction of assistance.</P>
              <P>(5) Based on the income information received from a SWICA or Federal agency, HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may inform an owner (or mortgagee) that an assistance applicant's or participant's eligibility for or level of assistance is uncertain and needs to be verified. The owner (or mortgagee) shall then confirm the assistance applicant's or participant's income information by checking the accuracy of the information with the employer or other income source, or directly with the family.</P>
              <P>(6) Nondisclosure of Income information. Neither HUD nor the PHA may disclose income information obtained from a SWICA directly to an owner (unless a PHA is the owner). Disclosure of income information obtained from the SSA or IRS is restricted under 26 U.S.C. § 6103(l)(7) and 42 U.S.C. 3544.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Opportunity to contest.</E> HUD, the PHA, or the owner (or mortgagee, as applicable) shall promptly notify any assistance applicant or participant in writing of any adverse findings made on the basis of the information verified in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The assistance applicant or participant may contest the findings in the same manner as applies to other information and findings relating to eligibility factors under the applicable program. Termination, denial, suspension, or reduction of assistance shall be carried out in accordance with requirements and procedures applicable to the individual covered program, and shall not occur until the expiration of any notice period provided by the statute or regulations governing the program.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Content of pet rules: General requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Housing programs.</E> The project owner shall prescribe reasonable rules to govern the keeping of common household pets. The pet rules must include the mandatory rules described in § 5.350 and may, unless otherwise noted in this subpart C, include other discretionary provisions as provided in § 5.318.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Public Housing programs.</E> (1) PHAs may choose not to promulgate rules governing the keeping of common household pets or may include rules as provided in § 5.318. PHAs may elect to include provisions based on those in § 5.350. If they so choose, the PHAs may modify the provisions in § 5.350 in any manner consistent with this subpart C.</P>
              <P>(2) If PHAs choose to promulgate pet rules, tenants must be permitted to own and keep pets in their units in accordance with the terms and conditions of their leases, the provisions of this subpart C, and any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.</P>
              <P>(3) PHAs that choose not to promulgate pet rules, shall not impose, by lease modification or otherwise, any requirement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart C.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of discretion.</E> (1) This subpart C does not define with specificity the limits of the project owners' or PHAs' discretion to promulgate pet rules. Where a project owner or PHA has discretion to prescribe pet rules under this subpart C, the pet rules should be:</P>
              <P>(i) Reasonably related to furthering a legitimate interest of the project owner or PHA, such as the owner's or PHA's interest in providing a decent, safe, and sanitary living environment for existing and prospective tenants and in protecting and preserving the physical condition of the project and the owner's or PHA's financial interest in it; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Drawn narrowly to achieve the owner's or PHA's legitimate interests, without imposing unnecessary burdens and restrictions on pet owners and prospective pet owners.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a project owner or PHA has discretion to prescribe pet rules under this subpart C, the owner or PHA may vary the rules' content among projects and within individual projects, based on factors such as the size, type, location, and occupancy of the project or its units, provided that the applicable rules are reasonable and do not conflict with any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conflict with State or local law.</E> The pet rules adopted by the project owner or PHA shall not conflict with applicable State or local law or regulations. If such a conflict may exist, the State and local law or regulations shall apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discretionary pet rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Pet rules promulgated by project owners and PHAs may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions of “common household pet”</E>—(1) <E T="03">For Public Housing programs.</E> The pet rules established by a PHA may contain a reasonable definition of a common household pet.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">For Housing programs.</E> Project owners wishing to define “common household pet” in their pet rules must use the Housing programs definition of the term in § 5.306.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Density of tenants and pets.</E> (1)(i) The pet rules established under this section may take into account tenant and pet density. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each dwelling unit. In the case of group homes, the pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each home.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">For Housing programs.</E> Under these rules, project owners may limit the number of four-legged, warm-blooded <PRTPAGE P="73"/>pets to one pet in each dwelling unit or group home.</P>
              <P>(iii) Other than the limitations described in this paragraph (b)(1), the pet rules may not limit the total number of pets allowed in the project.</P>
              <P>(2) As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the term “group home” means:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">For purposes of Housing programs.</E> A small, communal living arrangement designed specifically for individuals who are chronically mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or physically disabled who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">For purposes of Public Housing programs.</E> A dwelling or dwelling unit for the exclusive residential use of elderly persons or persons with disabilities who are not capable of living completely independently and who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pet size and pet type.</E> The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the size, weight, and type of common household pets allowed in the project.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Potential financial obligations of tenants</E>—(1) <E T="03">Pet deposits.</E> The pet rules may require tenants who own or keep pets in their units to pay a refundable pet deposit. In the case of project owners, this pet deposit shall be limited to those tenants who own or keep cats or dogs in their units. This deposit is in addition to any other financial obligation generally imposed on tenants of the project. The project owner or PHA may use the pet deposit only to pay reasonable expenses directly attributable to the presence of the pet in the project, including (but not limited to) the cost of repairs and replacements to, and fumigation of, the tenant's dwelling unit and, for project owners, the cost of animal care facilities under § 5.363. The project owner or PHA shall refund the unused portion of the pet deposit to the tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant moves from the project or no longer owns or keeps a pet (or a cat or dog in the case of project owners) in the dwelling unit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit.</E> (i) Pet deposits for the following tenants shall not exceed an amount periodically fixed by HUD through notice.</P>
              <P>(A) Tenants whose rents are subsidized (including tenants of a HUD-owned project, whose rents were subsidized before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.</P>
              <P>(B) Tenants who live in a project assisted (including tenants who live in a HUD-owned project that was assisted before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.</P>
              <P>(C) For all other tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities, the pet deposit shall not exceed one month's rent at the time the pet is brought onto the premises.</P>
              <P>(ii) In establishing the maximum amount of pet deposit under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, HUD will consider factors such as:</P>
              <P>(A) Projected, estimated expenses directly attributable to the presence of pets in the project;</P>
              <P>(B) The ability of project owners to offset such expenses by use of security deposits or HUD-reimbursable expenses; and</P>
              <P>(C) The low income status of tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(iii) For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner through an initial payment not to exceed $50 when the pet is brought onto the premises, and subsequent monthly payments not to exceed $10 per month until the amount of the deposit is reached.</P>
              <P>(iv) For pet deposits subject to paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the pet rules may provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner.</P>
              <P>(v) The project owner may (subject to the HUD-prescribed limits) increase the amount of the pet deposit by amending the house pet rules in accordance with § 5.353.</P>

              <P>(A) For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the house pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of any such increase <PRTPAGE P="74"/>not to exceed $10 per month for all deposit amounts that are being accumulated.</P>
              <P>(B) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(vi) Any pet deposit that is established within the parameters set forth by paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this subpart C.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Public Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit.</E> The maximum amount of pet deposit that may be charged by the PHA, on a per dwelling unit basis, shall not exceed the higher of the Total Tenant Payment (as defined in 24 CFR 913.102) or such reasonable fixed amount as the PHA may require. The pet rules may permit gradual accumulation of the pet deposit by the pet owner.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Housing programs: Waste removal charge.</E> The pet rules may permit the project owner to impose a separate waste removal charge of up to five dollars ($5) per occurrence on pet owners that fail to remove pet waste in accordance with the prescribed pet rules. Any pet waste removal charge that is within this five dollar ($5) limitation shall be deemed to be a reasonable amount for the purposes of this subpart C.</P>
              <P>(5) The pet deposit (for Housing and Public Housing programs) and waste removal charge (for Housing programs) are not part of the rent payable by the tenant. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for Housing programs and, paragraph (d) of this section and 24 CFR 966.4(b) for Public Housing programs, project owners or PHAs may not prescribe pet rules that impose additional financial obligations on pet owners that are designed to compensate the project owner or PHA for costs associated with the presence of pets in the project, including (but not limited to) requiring pet owners:</P>
              <P>(i) To obtain liability or other insurance to cover damage caused by the pet;</P>
              <P>(ii) To agree to be strictly liable for all damages caused by the pet where this liability is not otherwise imposed by State or local law, or</P>
              <P>(iii) To indemnify the project owner for pet-related litigation and attorney's fees.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Standards of pet care.</E> The pet rules may prescribe standards of pet care and handling, but must be limited to those necessary to protect the condition of the tenant's unit and the general condition of the project premises, or to protect the health or safety of present tenants, project employees, and the public. The pet rules may not require pet owners to have any pet's vocal cords removed. Permitted rules may:</P>
              <P>(1) Bar pets from specified common areas (such as lobbies, laundry rooms, and social rooms), unless the exclusion will deny a pet reasonable ingress and egress to the project or building.</P>
              <P>(2) Require the pet owner to control noise and odor caused by a pet.</P>
              <P>(3) Housing programs: Project owners may also:</P>
              <P>(i) Require pet owners to have their dogs and cats spayed or neutered; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Limit the length of time that a pet may be left unattended in a dwelling unit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Pet licensing.</E> The pet rules may require pet owners to license their pets in accordance with applicable State and local laws and regulations. (Failure of the pet rules to contain this requirement does not relieve the pet owner of responsibility for complying with applicable State and local pet licensing requirements.)</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Public Housing programs: Designated pet areas.</E> (1) PHAs may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings as no-pet areas where pets generally may not be permitted. Similarly, the pet rules may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings for residency generally by pet-owning tenants. The PHA may direct such initial tenant moves as may be necessary to establish pet and no-pet areas. The PHA may not refuse to admit (or delay admission of) an applicant for tenancy on the grounds that the applicant's admission would violate a pet or no-pet area. The PHA may adjust the pet and no-pet areas or may direct such additional moves as may be necessary (or both) to accommodate such applicants for tenancy or to meet the changing needs of existing tenants.</P>

              <P>(2) Project owners may not designate pet areas in buildings in their pet rules.<PRTPAGE P="75"/>
              </P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Pets temporarily on the premises.</E> The pet rules may exclude from the project pets not owned by a tenant that are to be kept temporarily on the project premises. For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, pets are to be kept “temporarily” if they are to be kept in the tenant's dwelling accommodations for a period of less than 14 consecutive days and nights. HUD, however, encourages project owners and PHAs to permit the use of a visiting pet program sponsored by a humane society, or other nonprofit organization.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Lease provisions.</E> (1) PHAs which have established pet rules and project owners shall ensure that the leases for all tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities:</P>
              <P>(i) State that tenants are permitted to keep common household pets in their dwelling units (subject to the provisions of this subpart and the pet rules);</P>
              <P>(ii) Shall incorporate by reference the pet rules promulgated by the project owner or PHA;</P>
              <P>(iii) Shall provide that the tenant agrees to comply with these rules; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Shall state that violation of these rules may be grounds for removal of the pet or termination of the pet owner's tenancy (or both), in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and applicable regulations and State or local law.</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) Where a PHA has not established pet rules, the leases of all tenants of such projects shall not contain any provisions prohibiting the owning or keeping of common household pets, and shall state that owning and keeping of such pets will be subject to the general obligations imposed on the PHA and tenants in the lease and any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.</P>

              <P>(ii) Forbid pet owners from exercising their pets or permitting their pets to deposit waste on the project premises outside the designated areas;<PRTPAGE P="76"/>

              <P>(2) In the case of cats and other pets using litter boxes, the pet rules may require the pet owner to change the litter (but not more than twice each week), may require pet owners to separate pet waste from litter (but not more than once each day), and may prescribe methods for the disposal of pet waste and used litter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pet restraint.</E> The pet rules shall require that all cats and dogs be appropriately and effectively restrained and under the control of a responsible individual while on the common areas of the project.</P>

The pet owner must register the pet before it is brought onto the project premises, and must update the registration at least annually. The project owner may coordinate the annual update with the annual reexamination of tenant income, if applicable. The registration must include:</P>
              <P>(i) A certificate signed by a licensed veterinarian or a State or local authority empowered to inoculate animals (or designated agent of such an authority) stating that the pet has received all inoculations required by applicable State and local law;</P>

              <P>(3) The pet rules shall permit the project owner to refuse to register a pet if:</P>
              <P>(i) The pet is not a common household pet;</P>
              <P>(ii) The keeping of the pet would violate any applicable house pet rule;</P>

              <P>(iv) The project owner reasonably determines, based on the pet owner's habits and practices, that the pet owner will be unable to keep the pet in compliance with the pet rules and other lease obligations. The pet's temperament may be considered as a factor in determining the prospective pet owner's ability to comply with the pet rules and other lease obligations.</P>
              <P>(4) The project owner may not refuse to register a pet based on a determination that the pet owner is financially unable to care for the pet or that the pet is inappropriate, based on the therapeutic value to the pet owner or the interests of the property or existing tenants.</P>

The project owner must consider comments made at these meetings only if they are summarized, reduced to writing, and submitted to the project owner before the end of the comment period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Development and notice of final pet rules.</E> The project owner shall develop the final rules after reviewing tenants' written comments and written summaries of any owner-tenant meetings. The project owner may meet with tenants and tenant representatives to attempt to resolve issues raised by the comments. Subject to this subpart C, the content of the final pet rules, however, is within the sole discretion of the project owner.

              <P>(iii) For service of notice to tenants of a high-rise building, posting the notice in at least three conspicuous places within the building and maintaining the posted notices intact and in legible form for 30 days. For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, a high-rise building is a structure that is equipped with an elevator and has a common lobby.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of computing time periods following service of the notice, service is effective on the day that all notices are delivered or mailed, or in the case of service by posting, on the day that all notices are initially posted.</P>

              <P>(4) State that the pet owner's failure to correct the violation, to request a meeting, or to appear at a requested meeting may result in initiation of procedures to terminate the pet owner's tenancy.<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b)(1) <E T="03">Pet rule violation meeting.</E> If the pet owner makes a timely request for a meeting to discuss an alleged pet rule violation, the project owner shall establish a mutually agreeable time and place for the meeting but no later than 15 days from the effective date of service of the notice of pet rule violation (unless the project owner agrees to a later date). At the pet rule violation meeting, the pet owner and project owner shall discuss any alleged pet rule violation and attempt to correct it. The project owner may, as a result of the meeting, give the pet owner additional time to correct the violation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice for pet removal.</E> If the pet owner and project owner are unable to resolve the pet rule violation at the pet rule violation meeting, or if the project owner determines that the pet owner has failed to correct the pet rule violation within any additional time provided for this purpose under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the project owner may serve a written notice on the pet owner in accordance with § 5.353(f)(1) (i) or (ii) (or at the meeting, if appropriate), requiring the pet owner to remove the pet.

              <P>(ii) The pet rule violation is sufficient to begin procedures to terminate the pet owner's tenancy under the terms of the lease and applicable regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) The project owner may initiate procedures to remove a pet under § 5.327 at any time, in accordance with the provisions of applicable State or local law.</P>

              <P>(a) An applicant for tenancy in a project for the elderly or persons with disabilities may reject a unit offered by a project owner if the unit is in close proximity to a dwelling unit in which an existing tenant of the project owns or keeps a common household pet. An applicant's rejection of a unit under this section shall not adversely affect his or her application for tenancy in the project, including (but not limited to) his or her position on the project waiting list or qualification for any tenant selection preference.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Inspections.</E> In addition to other inspections permitted under the lease, the leases for all Housing program tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities may state that the project owner may, after reasonable notice to the tenant and during reasonable hours, enter and inspect the premises. The lease shall permit entry and inspection only if the project owner has received a signed, written complaint alleging (or the project owner has reasonable grounds to believe) that the conduct or condition of a pet in the dwelling unit constitutes, under applicable State or local law, a nuisance or a threat to the health or safety of the occupants of the project or other persons in the community where the project is located.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergencies.</E> (1) If there is no State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) authorized under applicable State or local law to <PRTPAGE P="79"/>remove a pet that becomes vicious, displays symptoms of severe illness, or demonstrates other behavior that constitutes an immediate threat to the health or safety of the tenancy as a whole, the project owner may place a provision in tenant leases permitting the project owner to enter the premises (if necessary), remove the pet, and take such action with respect to the pet as may be permissible under State and local law, which may include placing it in a facility that will provide care and shelter for a period not to exceed 30 days.</P>
              <P>(2) The lease shall permit the project owner to enter the premises and remove the pet or take such other permissible action only if the project owner requests the pet owner to remove the pet from the project immediately, and the pet owner refuses to do so, or if the project owner is unable to contact the pet owner to make a removal request. The lease may not contain a provision relieving the project owner from liability for wrongful removal of a pet. The cost of the animal care facility shall be paid as provided in § 5.363.</P>
              <P>(3) The project owner may place a provision in tenant leases permitting the project owner to enter the premises, remove the pet, and place the pet in a facility that will provide care and shelter, in accordance with the provisions of § 5.363. The lease may not contain a provision relieving the project owner from liability for wrongful removal of a pet.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Housing programs: Protection of the pet.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) If the health or safety of a pet is threatened by the death or incapacity of the pet owner, or by other factors that render the pet owner unable to care for the pet, the project owner may contact the responsible party or parties listed in the pet registration required under § 5.350(d)(1)(iii).</P>
              <P>(b) If the responsible party or parties are unwilling or unable to care for the pet, or the project owner, despite reasonable efforts, has been unable to contact the responsible party or parties, the project owner may contact the appropriate State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) and request the removal of the pet.</P>
              <P>(c) If there is no State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) authorized to remove a pet under these circumstances and the project owner has placed a provision in the lease agreement (as described in § 5.360(c)(2)), the project owner may enter the pet owner's unit, remove the pet, and place the pet in a facility that will provide care and shelter until the pet owner or a representative of the pet owner is able to assume responsibility for the pet, but not longer than 30 days.</P>
              <P>(d) The cost of the animal care facility provided under this section shall be borne by the pet owner. If the pet owner (or the pet owner's estate) is unable or unwilling to pay, the cost of the animal care facility may be paid from the pet deposit, if imposed under the pet rules.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Availability of preservation assistance to mixed families and other families.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assistance available for tenant mixed families</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Preservation assistance is available to tenant mixed families, following completion of the appeals and informal hearing procedures provided in § 5.514. There are three types of preservation assistance:</P>
            <P>(i) Continued assistance (see paragraph (a) of § 5.518);</P>
            <P>(ii) Temporary deferral of termination of assistance (see paragraph (b) of § 5.518); or</P>
            <P>(iii) Prorated assistance (see § 5.520, a mixed family must be provided prorated assistance if the family so requests).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Availability of assistance</E>—(i) <E T="03">For Housing covered programs:</E> One of the three types of assistance described is available to tenant mixed families assisted under a National Housing Act or 1965 HUD Act covered program, depending upon the family's eligibility for such assistance. Continued assistance must be provided to a mixed family that meets the conditions for eligibility for continued assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs.</E> One of the three types of assistance described may be available <PRTPAGE P="90"/>to tenant mixed families assisted under a Section 8 or Public Housing covered program.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Assistance available for applicant mixed families.</E> Prorated assistance is also available for mixed families applying for assistance as provided in § 5.520.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Assistance available to other families in occupancy.</E> Temporary deferral of termination of assistance may be available to families receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on June 19, 1995, and who have no members with eligible immigration status, as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">For Housing covered programs:</E> Temporary deferral of termination of assistance is available to families assisted under a Housing covered program.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs:</E> The responsible entity may make temporary deferral of termination of assistance to families assisted under a Section 8 or Public Housing covered program.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Section 8 covered programs: Discretion afforded to provide certain family preservation assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Project owners.</E> With respect to assistance under a Section 8 Act covered program administered by a project owner, HUD has the discretion to determine under what circumstances families are to be provided one of the two statutory forms of assistance for preservation of the family (continued assistance or temporary deferral of assistance). HUD is exercising its discretion by specifying the standards in this section under which a project owner must provide one of these two types of assistance to a family. However, project owners and PHAs must offer prorated assistance to eligible mixed families.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">PHAs.</E> The PHA, rather than HUD, has the discretion to determine the circumstances under which a family will be offered one of the two statutory forms of assistance (continued assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance). The PHA must establish its own policy and criteria to follow in making its decision. In establishing the criteria for granting continued assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, the PHA must incorporate the statutory criteria, which are set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 5.518. However, the PHA must offer prorated assistance to eligible families.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Continued assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A mixed family may receive continued housing assistance if all of the following conditions are met (a mixed family assisted under a Housing covered program must be provided continued assistance if the family meets the following conditions):</P>
            <P>(i) The family was receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on June 19, 1995;</P>
            <P>(ii) The family's head of household or spouse has eligible immigration status as described in § 5.506; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The family does not include any person (who does not have eligible immigration status) other than the head of household, any spouse of the head of household, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, or any children of the head of household or spouse.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Proration of continued assistance.</E> A family entitled to continued assistance before November 29, 1996 is entitled to continued assistance as described in paragraph (a) of this section. A family entitled to continued assistance after November 29, 1996 shall receive prorated assistance as described in § 5.520.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary deferral of termination of assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Eligibility for this type of assistance.</E> If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from a rent level that <PRTPAGE P="91"/>reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard, that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Housing covered programs: Conditions for granting temporary deferral of termination of assistance.</E> The responsible entity shall grant a temporary deferral of termination of assistance to a mixed family if the family is assisted under a Housing covered program and one of the following conditions is met:</P>
            <P>(i) The family demonstrates that reasonable efforts to find other affordable housing of appropriate size have been unsuccessful (for purposes of this section, reasonable efforts include seeking information from, and pursuing leads obtained from the State housing agency, the city government, local newspapers, rental agencies and the owner);</P>
            <P>(ii) The vacancy rate for affordable housing of appropriate size is below five percent in the housing market for the area in which the project is located; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The consolidated plan, as described in 24 CFR part 91 and if applicable to the covered program, indicates that the local jurisdiction's housing market lacks sufficient affordable housing opportunities for households having a size and income similar to the family seeking the deferral.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time limit on deferral period.</E> If temporary deferral of termination of assistance is granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period not to exceed six months. The initial period may be renewed for additional periods of six months, but the aggregate deferral period for deferrals provided after November 29, 1996 shall not exceed a period of eighteen months. The aggregate deferral period for deferrals granted prior to November 29, 1996 shall not exceed 3 years. These time periods do not apply to a family which includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Notification requirements for beginning of each deferral period.</E> At the beginning of each deferral period, the responsible entity must inform the family of its ineligibility for financial assistance and offer the family information concerning, and referrals to assist in finding, other affordable housing.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Determination of availability of affordable housing at end of each deferral period.</E> (i) Before the end of each deferral period, the responsible entity must satisfy the applicable requirements of either paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Specifically, the responsible entity must:</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">For Housing covered programs:</E> Make a determination that one of the two conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section continues to be met (note: affordable housing will be determined to be available if the vacancy rate is five percent or greater), the owner's knowledge and the tenant's evidence indicate that other affordable housing is available; or</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs:</E> Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on evidence of conditions which when taken together will demonstrate an inadequate supply of affordable housing for the area in which the project is located, the consolidated plan (if applicable, as described in 24 CFR part 91), the responsible entity's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant family's efforts to locate such housing.</P>
            <P>(ii) The responsible entity must also:</P>

            <P>(A) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral periods that exceeds the maximum deferral period). This time period does not apply to a family which includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act, and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available; <E T="03">or</E>
            </P>

            <P>(B) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination of financial assistance will not be deferred because either granting <PRTPAGE P="92"/>another deferral will result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed the maximum deferral period (unless the family includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act), or a determination has been made that other affordable housing is available.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Option to select proration of assistance at end of deferral period.</E> A family who is eligible for, and receives temporary deferral of termination of assistance, may request, and the responsible entity shall provide proration of assistance at the end of the deferral period if the family has made a good faith effort during the deferral period to locate other affordable housing.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of decision on family preservation assistance.</E> A responsible entity shall notify the family of its decision concerning the family's qualification for family preservation assistance. If the family is ineligible for family preservation assistance, the notification shall state the reasons, which must be based on relevant factors. For tenant families, the notice also shall inform the family of any applicable appeal rights.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Determine the total tenant payment in accordance with section 5.628. (Annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status.)</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Subtract the total tenant payment from the PHA-established flat rent applicable to the unit. The result is the maximum subsidy for which the family could qualify if all members were eligible (“family maximum subsidy”).</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Divide the family maximum subsidy by the number of persons in the family (all persons) to determine the maximum subsidy per each family member who has citizenship or eligible immigration status (“eligible family member”). The subsidy per eligible family member is the “member maximum subsidy.”</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Multiply the member maximum subsidy by the number of family members who have citizenship or eligible immigration status (“eligible family members”).</P>
            <P>(2) The product of steps 1 through 4 of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section is the amount of subsidy for which the family is eligible (“eligible subsidy”). The family's rent is the PHA-established flat rent minus the amount of the eligible subsidy.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Method of prorating assistance when the mixed family's total tenant payment (TTP) is greater than the public housing flat rent.</E> When the mixed family's TTP is greater than the flat rent, the PHA must use the TTP as the mixed family TTP. The PHA subtracts from the mixed family TTP any established utility allowance, and the sum becomes the mixed family rent.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to covered families who reside in public <PRTPAGE P="101"/>housing (part 960 of this title) or receive Section 8 tenant-based assistance (part 982 of this title).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Covered families.</E> Families who receive welfare assistance or other public assistance benefits (“welfare benefits”) from a State or other public agency (“welfare agency”) under a program for which Federal, State, or local law requires that a member of the family must participate in an economic self-sufficiency program as a condition for such assistance.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Economic self-sufficiency program.</E> See definition at § 5.603.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Imputed welfare income.</E> The amount of annual income not actually received by a family, as a result of a specified welfare benefit reduction, that is nonetheless included in the family's annual income for purposes of determining rent.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Specified welfare benefit reduction.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) A reduction of welfare benefits by the welfare agency, in whole or in part, for a family member, as determined by the welfare agency, because of fraud by a family member in connection with the welfare program; or because of welfare agency sanction against a family member for noncompliance with a welfare agency requirement to participate in an economic self-sufficiency program.</P>
              <P>(2) “Specified welfare benefit reduction” does not include a reduction or termination of welfare benefits by the welfare agency:</P>
              <P>(i) at expiration of a lifetime or other time limit on the payment of welfare benefits;</P>
              <P>(ii) because a family member is not able to obtain employment, even though the family member has complied with welfare agency economic self-sufficiency or work activities requirements; or</P>
              <P>(iii) because a family member has not complied with other welfare agency requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Imputed welfare income.</E> (1) A family's annual income includes the amount of imputed welfare income (because of a specified welfare benefits reduction, as specified in notice to the PHA by the welfare agency), plus the total amount of other annual income as determined in accordance with § 5.609.</P>
              <P>(2) At the request of the PHA, the welfare agency will inform the PHA in writing of the amount and term of any specified welfare benefit reduction for a family member, and the reason for such reduction, and will also inform the PHA of any subsequent changes in the term or amount of such specified welfare benefit reduction. The PHA will use this information to determine the amount of imputed welfare income for a family.</P>
              <P>(3) A family's annual income includes imputed welfare income in family annual income, as determined at the PHA's interim or regular reexamination of family income and composition, during the term of the welfare benefits reduction (as specified in information provided to the PHA by the welfare agency).</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of the imputed welfare income is offset by the amount of additional income a family receives that commences after the time the sanction was imposed. When such additional income from other sources is at least equal to the imputed welfare income, the imputed welfare income is reduced to zero.</P>
              <P>(5) The PHA may not include imputed welfare income in annual income if the family was not an assisted resident at the time of sanction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of PHA decision</E>—(1) <E T="03">Public housing.</E> If a public housing tenant claims that the PHA has not correctly calculated the amount of imputed welfare income in accordance with HUD requirements, and if the PHA denies the family's request to modify such amount, the PHA shall give the tenant written notice of such denial, with a brief explanation of the basis for the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income. The PHA notice shall also state that if the tenant does not agree with the PHA determination, the tenant may request a grievance hearing in accordance with part 966, subpart B of this title to review the PHA determination. The tenant is not required to pay an escrow deposit pursuant to § 966.55(e) for the portion of tenant rent attributable to the <PRTPAGE P="102"/>imputed welfare income in order to obtain a grievance hearing on the PHA determination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Section 8 participant.</E> A participant in the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program may request an informal hearing, in accordance with § 982.555 of this title, to review the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income that must be included in the family's annual income in accordance with this section. If the family claims that such amount is not correctly calculated in accordance with HUD requirements, and if the PHA denies the family's request to modify such amount, the PHA shall give the family written notice of such denial, with a brief explanation of the basis for the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income. Such notice shall also state that if the family does not agree with the PHA determination, the family may request an informal hearing on the determination under the PHA hearing procedure.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">PHA relation with welfare agency.</E> (1) The PHA must ask welfare agencies to inform the PHA of any specified welfare benefits reduction for a family member, the reason for such reduction, the term of any such reduction, and any subsequent welfare agency determination affecting the amount or term of a specified welfare benefits reduction. If the welfare agency determines a specified welfare benefits reduction for a family member, and gives the PHA written notice of such reduction, the family's annual incomes shall include the imputed welfare income because of the specified welfare benefits reduction.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA is responsible for determining the amount of imputed welfare income that is included in the family's annual income as a result of a specified welfare benefits reduction as determined by the welfare agency, and specified in the notice by the welfare agency to the PHA. However, the PHA is not responsible for determining whether a reduction of welfare benefits by the welfare agency was correctly determined by the welfare agency in accordance with welfare program requirements and procedures, nor for providing the opportunity for review or hearing on such welfare agency determinations.</P>
              <P>(3) Such welfare agency determinations are the responsibility of the welfare agency, and the family may seek appeal of such determinations through the welfare agency's normal due process procedures. The PHA shall be entitled to rely on the welfare agency notice to the PHA of the welfare agency's determination of a specified welfare benefits reduction.</P>

              <P>(D) If the PHA determines that a qualifying financial hardship is temporary, the PHA must reinstate the minimum rent from the beginning of the suspension of the minimum rent. The PHA must offer the family a reasonable repayment agreement, on terms and conditions established by the PHA, for the amount of back minimum rent owed by the family.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">All section 8 programs.</E> (A) If a family requests a financial hardship exemption, the responsible entity must suspend the minimum rent requirement beginning the month following the family's request for a hardship exemption until the responsible entity determines whether there is a qualifying financial hardship, and whether such hardship is temporary or long term.</P>
              <P>(B) The responsible entity must promptly determine whether a qualifying hardship exists and whether it is temporary or long term.</P>
              <P>(C) If the responsible entity determines that a qualifying financial hardship is temporary, the PHA must not impose the minimum rent during the 90-day period beginning the month following the date of the family's request for a hardship exemption.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payment of utility reimbursement.</E> (1) The responsible entity pays a utility reimbursement if the utility allowance (for tenant-paid utilities) exceeds the amount of the total tenant payment. The responsible entity has the option of making utility reimbursement payments not less than once per calendar-year quarter, for reimbursements totaling $45 or less per quarter. In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the responsible entity must reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs and owners exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.</P>
              <P>(2) In the public housing program (where the family is paying an income-based rent), the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program and the Section 8 certificate or voucher program, the PHA may pay the utility reimbursement either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.</P>
              <P>(3) In the other Section 8 programs, the owner must pay the utility reimbursement either:</P>
              <P>(i) To the family, or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Section 8 project-based assistance programs: Admission—Income-eligibility and income-targeting.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section describes requirements concerning income-eligibility and income-targeting that apply to the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, except for the moderate rehabilitation and the project-based certificate or voucher programs.<PRTPAGE P="106"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Who is eligible?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basic eligibility.</E> An applicant must meet all eligibility requirements in order to receive housing assistance. At a minimum, the applicant must be a family, as defined in § 5.403, and must be income-eligible, as described in this section. Such eligible applicants include single persons.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Low income limit.</E> No family other than a low income family is eligible for admission to the Section 8 project-based assistance programs. (This paragraph (b) does not apply to the Section 8 project-based voucher program under part 983 of this title.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Targeting to extremely low income families.</E> For each project assisted under a contract for project-based assistance, of the dwelling units that become available for occupancy in any fiscal year that are assisted under the contract, not less than 40 percent shall be available for leasing only by families that are extremely low income families at the time of admission.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitation on admission of non-very low income families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Admission to units available before October 1, 1981.</E> Not more than 25 percent of the Section 8 project-based dwelling units that were available for occupancy under Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts effective before October 1, 1981 and that are leased on or after that date shall be available for leasing by low income families other than very low income families. HUD reserves the right to limit the admission of low income families other than very low income families to these units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Admission to units available on or after October 1, 1981.</E> Not more than 15 percent of the Section 8 project-based dwelling units that initially become available for occupancy under Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contracts on or after October 1, 1981 shall be available for leasing by low income families other than families that are very low income families at the time of admission to the Section 8 program. Except with the prior approval of HUD under paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the owner may only lease such units to very low income families.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Request for exception.</E> A request by an owner for approval of admission of low income families other than very low income families to section 8 project-based units must state the basis for requesting the exception and provide supporting data. Bases for exceptions that may be considered include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Need for admission of a broader range of tenants to preserve the financial or management viability of a project because there is an insufficient number of potential applicants who are very low income families;</P>
              <P>(ii) Commitment of an owner to attaining occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes;</P>
              <P>(iii) Project supervision by a State Housing Finance Agency having a policy of occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes supported by evidence that the Agency is pursuing this goal throughout its assisted projects in the community, or a project with financing through Section 11(b) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437i) or under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 103); and</P>
              <P>(iv) Low-income families that otherwise would be displaced from a Section 8 project.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Action on request for exception.</E> Whether to grant any request for exception is a matter committed by law to HUD's discretion, and no implication is intended to be created that HUD will seek to grant approvals up to the maximum limits permitted by statute, nor is any presumption of an entitlement to an exception created by the specification of certain grounds for exception that HUD may consider. HUD will review exceptions granted to owners at regular intervals. HUD may withdraw permission to exercise those exceptions for program applicants at any time that exceptions are not being used or after a periodic review, based on the findings of the review.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Income used for eligibility and targeting.</E> Family annual income (see § 5.609) is used both for determination of income-eligibility and for income-targeting under this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reporting.</E> The Section 8 owner must comply with HUD-prescribed reporting requirements, including income reporting requirements that will <PRTPAGE P="107"/>permit HUD to maintain the data necessary to monitor compliance with income-eligibility and income-targeting requirements.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to the section 8 project-based assistance programs. The section describes requirements concerning the Section 8 owner's selection of residents to occupy a project or unit, except for the moderate rehabilitation and the project-based certificate or voucher programs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection</E>—(1) <E T="03">Selection for owner's project or unit.</E> Selection for occupancy of a project or unit is the function of the Section 8 owner. However, selection is subject to the income-eligibility and income-targeting requirements in § 5.653.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Tenant selection plan.</E> The owner must adopt a written tenant selection plan in accordance with HUD requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of income.</E> The owner may not select a family for occupancy of a project or unit in an order different from the order on the owner's waiting list for the purpose of selecting a relatively higher income family. However, an owner may select a family for occupancy of a project or unit based on its income in order to satisfy the targeting requirements of § 5.653(c).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Selection for particular unit.</E> In selecting a family to occupy a particular unit, the owner may match family characteristics with the type of unit available, for example, number of bedrooms. If a unit has special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the owner must first offer the unit to families which include persons with disabilities who require such features (see §§ 8.27 and 100.202 of this title).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Housing assistance limitation for single persons.</E> A single person who is not an elderly or displaced person, a person with disabilities, or the remaining member of a resident family may not be provided a housing unit with two or more bedrooms.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Particular owner preferences.</E> The owner must inform all applicants about available preferences and must give applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for available preferences.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Residency requirements or preferences.</E> (i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although the owner is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the owner may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”).</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner's residency preference must be approved by HUD in one of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(A) Prior approval of the housing market area in the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing plan (in accordance with § 108.25 of this title) as a residency preference area;</P>
              <P>(B) Prior approval of the residency preference area in the PHA plan of the jurisdiction in which the project is located;</P>
              <P>(C) Modification of the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, in accordance with § 108.25 of this title,</P>
              <P>(iv) Use of a residency preference may not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to a project or unit based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.</P>
              <P>(v) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.</P>
              <P>(vi) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The owner may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for working families.</E> (i) The owner may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families <PRTPAGE P="108"/>where the head, spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member, is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the owner adopts a preference for admission of working families, the owner must not give a preference based on the amount of earned income.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Preference for person with disabilities.</E> The owner may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the owner may not adopt a preference for admission of persons with a specific disability.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Preference for victims of domestic violence.</E> The owner should consider whether to adopt a preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced, homeless or persons with disabilities over other single persons.</E> The owner may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Regular reexamination.</E> The owner must conduct a reexamination and redetermination of family income and composition at least annually.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> A family may request an interim reexamination of family income because of any changes since the last examination. The owner must make the interim reexamination within a reasonable time after the family request. The owner may adopt policies prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> An owner may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of “fixed income”.</E> For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:</P>
              <P>(i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.</P>
              <P>(ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.</P>

              <P>(iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Method of streamlined income determination.</E> Owners using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.</P>
              <P>(i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, owners using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's fixed-income sources, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, owners may choose, but are not required, to make appropriate adjustments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, owners using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income. Owners must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">COLA rate applied by owners.</E> Owners using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public <PRTPAGE P="109"/>verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Triennial verification.</E> For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, an owner must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.</P>

              <P>(iv) How residence by security personnel in a project unit will increase security for Section 8 assisted families residing in the project.</P>
              <P>(v) The amount payable monthly as rent to the unit owner by security personnel residing in the project (including a description of how this amount is determined), and the amount of any other compensation by the owner to such resident security personnel.</P>
              <P>(vi) The terms of occupancy by such security personnel. The lease by owner to the approved security personnel may provide that occupancy of the unit is authorized only while the security personnel is satisfactorily performing any agreed responsibilities and functions for project security.</P>
              <P>(vii) Other information as requested by the contract administrator.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Housing assistance payment and rent.</E> (1) During approved occupancy by security personnel as provided in this section, the amount of the monthly housing assistance payment to the owner shall be equal to the contract rent (as determined in accordance with the HAP contract and HUD requirements) minus the amount (as approved by the contract administrator) of rent payable monthly as rent to the unit owner by such security personnel. The owner shall bear the risk of collecting such rent from such security personnel, and the amount of the housing assistance payment shall not be increased because of non-payment by such security personnel. The owner shall not be entitled to receive any vacancy payment for the period following occupancy by such security personnel.</P>

              <P>(2) In approving the amount of monthly rent payable by security personnel for occupancy of a contract unit, the contract administrator may consider whether security services to be performed are an adequate return for housing assistance payments on the <PRTPAGE P="111"/>unit, or whether the cost of security services should be borne by the owner from other project income.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Physical condition standards for HUD housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair (DSS/GR).</SUBJECT>
            <P>HUD housing must be decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. Owners of housing described in § 5.701(a), mortgagors of housing described in § 5.701(b), and PHAs and other entities approved by HUD owning housing described in § 5.701(c), must maintain such housing in a manner that meets the physical condition standards set forth in this section in order to be considered decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. These standards address the major areas of the HUD housing: the site; the building exterior; the building systems; the dwelling units; the common areas; and health and safety considerations.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Site.</E> The site components, such as fencing and retaining walls, grounds, lighting, mailboxes/project signs, parking lots/driveways, play areas and equipment, refuse disposal, roads, storm drainage and walkways must be free of health and safety hazards and be in good repair. The site must not be subject to material adverse conditions, such as abandoned vehicles, dangerous walks or steps, poor drainage, septic tank back-ups, sewer hazards, excess accumulations of trash, vermin or rodent infestation or fire hazards.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Building exterior.</E> Each building on the site must be structurally sound, secure, habitable, and in good repair. Each building's doors, fire escapes, foundations, lighting, roofs, walls, and windows, where applicable, must be free of health and safety hazards, operable, and in good repair.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Building systems.</E> Each building's domestic water, electrical system, elevators, emergency power, fire protection, HVAC, and sanitary system must be free of health and safety hazards, functionally adequate, operable, and in good repair.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Dwelling units.</E> (1) Each dwelling unit within a building must be structurally sound, habitable, and in good repair. All areas and aspects of the dwelling unit (for example, the unit's bathroom, call-for-aid (if applicable), ceiling, doors, electrical systems, floors, hot water heater, HVAC (where individual units are provided), kitchen, lighting, outlets/switches, patio/porch/balcony, smoke detectors, stairs, walls, and windows) must be free of health and safety hazards, functionally adequate, operable, and in good repair.</P>
            <P>(2) Where applicable, the dwelling unit must have hot and cold running water, including an adequate source of potable water (note for example that single room occupancy units need not contain water facilities).</P>
            <P>(3) If the dwelling unit includes its own sanitary facility, it must be in proper operating condition, usable in privacy, and adequate for personal hygiene and the disposal of human waste.</P>

            <P>(4) The dwelling unit must include at least one battery-operated or hard-<PRTPAGE P="112"/>wired smoke detector, in proper working condition, on each level of the unit.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Common areas.</E> The common areas must be structurally sound, secure, and functionally adequate for the purposes intended. The basement/garage/carport, restrooms, closets, utility, mechanical, community rooms, day care, halls/corridors, stairs, kitchens, laundry rooms, office, porch, patio, balcony, and trash collection areas, if applicable, must be free of health and safety hazards, operable, and in good repair. All common area ceilings, doors, floors, HVAC, lighting, outlets/switches, smoke detectors, stairs, walls, and windows, to the extent applicable, must be free of health and safety hazards, operable, and in good repair. These standards for common areas apply, to a varying extent, to all HUD housing, but will be particularly relevant to congregate housing, independent group homes/residences, and single room occupancy units, in which the individual dwelling units (sleeping areas) do not contain kitchen and/or bathroom facilities.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Health and safety concerns.</E> All areas and components of the housing must be free of health and safety hazards. These areas include, but are not limited to, air quality, electrical hazards, elevators, emergency/fire exits, flammable materials, garbage and debris, handrail hazards, infestation, and lead-based paint. For example, the buildings must have fire exits that are not blocked and have hand rails that are undamaged and have no other observable deficiencies. The housing must have no evidence of infestation by rats, mice, or other vermin, or of garbage and debris. The housing must have no evidence of electrical hazards, natural hazards, or fire hazards. The dwelling units and common areas must have proper ventilation and be free of mold, odor (e.g., propane, natural gas, methane gas), or other observable deficiencies. The housing must comply with all requirements related to the evaluation and reduction of lead-based paint hazards and have available proper certifications of such (see 24 CFR part 35).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance with State and local codes.</E> The physical condition standards in this section do not supersede or preempt State and local codes for building and maintenance with which HUD housing must comply. HUD housing must continue to adhere to these codes.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of financial information.</E> Entities (or individuals) to which this subpart is applicable must provide to HUD such financial information as required by HUD. Such information must be provided on an annual basis, except as required more frequently under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. This information must be:</P>
            <P>(1) Prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as further defined by HUD in supplementary guidance;</P>
            <P>(2) Submitted electronically to HUD through the internet, or in such other electronic format designated by HUD, or in such non-electronic format as HUD may allow if the burden or cost of electronic reporting is determined by HUD to be excessive; and</P>
            <P>(3) Submitted in such form and substance as prescribed by HUD.</P>
            <P>(4) With respect to financial reports relating to properties insured under section 232 of the Act, concurrently with submitting the information to HUD, submitted to the mortgagee in a format and manner prescribed and/or approved by HUD.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing of financial reports.</E> (1) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 60 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law (for public housing agencies, see also 24 CFR 903.33).</P>
            <P>(2) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law.</P>

            <P>(3) For those entities listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) <PRTPAGE P="114"/>of this section must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year (or within an extended time if an extension is granted at the sole discretion of the Secretary). An extension request must be received no earlier than 45 days and no later than 15 days prior to the submission deadline.</P>
            <P>(4) For entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to HUD on a quarterly and fiscal-year-to-date basis, within 60 calendar days of the end of each quarterly reporting period deadline, except that the final fiscal-year-end quarter and fiscal-year-to-date reports must be submitted to HUD within 90 calendar days of the end of the fiscal-year-end quarter, or within such additional time as may be provided by the Commissioner for good cause shown. HUD may direct that such forms be submitted to the lender or another third party in addition to or in lieu of submission to HUD.</P>
            <P>(i) The financial statements submitted by entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section may, at the operator's option, be operator-certified rather than audited, provided, however, if the operator is also the borrower, then that entity's obligation to submit an annual audited financial statement (in addition to its obligation as an operator to submit financial information on a quarterly and year-to-date basis) remains and is not obviated.</P>
            <P>(ii) If HUD has reason to believe that a particular operator's operator-certified statements may be unreliable (for example, indicate a likely prohibited use of project funds), or are presented in a manner that is inconsistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, require audited financial statements from the operator. With respect to facilities with FHA-insured or HUD-held Section 232 mortgages, HUD may request more frequent financial statements from the borrower and/or the operator on a case-by-case basis when the circumstances warrant. Nothing in this section limits HUD's ability to obtain further or more frequent information when appropriate pursuant to the applicable regulatory agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Reporting compliance dates.</E> Entities (or individuals) that are subject to the reporting requirements in this section must commence compliance with these requirements as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) For PHAs listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the requirements of this section will begin with those PHAs with fiscal years ending September 30, 1999 and later. Unaudited financial statements will be required 60 days after the PHA's fiscal year end, and audited financial statements will then be required no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. A PHA with a fiscal year ending September 30, 1999 that elects to submit its unaudited financial report earlier than the due date of November 30, 1999 must submit its report as required in this section. On or after September 30, 1998, but prior to November 30, 1999 (except for a PHA with its fiscal year ending September 30, 1999), PHAs may submit their financial reports in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, the requirements of this section will begin with those entities with fiscal years ending December 31, 1998 and later. Entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section with fiscal years ending December 31, 1998 that elect to submit their reports earlier than the due date must submit their financial reports as required in this section. On or after September 30, 1998 but prior to January 1, 1999, these entities may submit their financial reports in accordance with this section.</P>

            <P>(3) The requirements of this section apply to the entities listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section with fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2002. Audited financial statements submitted by lenders with fiscal years ending before September 30, 2002, may either be submitted in paper or electronically at the lenders' option. Audited financial statements submitted by lenders with fiscal years ending on or after September 30, 2002, must be submitted electronically.<PRTPAGE P="115"/>
            </P>

            <P>(4) Entities described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must comply with the requirements of this section with respect to fiscal years commencing on or after the date that is 60 calendar days after the date on which HUD announces, through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, that it has issued guidance on the manner in which these reports will be transmitted to HUD.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitation on changing fiscal years.</E> To allow for a period of consistent assessment of the financial reports submitted to HUD under this subpart part, PHAs listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section will not be allowed to change their fiscal years for their first three full fiscal years following October 1, 1998.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility for submission of financial report.</E> The responsibility for submission of the financial report due to HUD under this section rests with the individuals and entities listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What special authority is there to obtain access to criminal records?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> If you are a PHA that administers the Section 8 program and/or the public housing program, this section authorizes you to obtain criminal conviction records from a law enforcement agency, as defined in § 5.902.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure for PHA.</E> (1) When the law enforcement agency receives your request, the law enforcement agency must promptly release to you a certified copy of any criminal conviction records concerning the household member in the possession or control of the law enforcement agency. NCIC records must be provided in accordance with NCIC procedures.</P>
            <P>(2) The law enforcement agency may charge you a reasonable fee for releasing criminal conviction records.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Owner access to criminal records</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> (i) If an owner submits a request to the PHA for criminal records concerning an adult member of an applicant or resident household, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the PHA must request the criminal conviction records from the appropriate law enforcement agency or agencies, as determined by the PHA.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the PHA receives criminal conviction records requested by an owner, the PHA must determine whether criminal action by a household member, as shown by such criminal conviction records, may be a basis for applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction, as applicable in accordance with HUD regulations and the owner criteria.</P>
            <P>(iii) The PHA must notify the owner whether the PHA has received criminal conviction records concerning the household member, and of its determination whether such criminal conviction records may be a basis for applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction. However, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the PHA must not disclose the household member's criminal conviction record or the content of that record to the owner.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Screening.</E> If you are an owner of covered housing, you may request that the PHA in the jurisdiction of the property obtain criminal conviction records of an adult household member from a law enforcement agency on your behalf for the purpose of screening applicants.<PRTPAGE P="120"/>

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Eviction or lease enforcement.</E> If you are an owner of a unit with Section 8 project-based assistance, you may request that the PHA in the location of the project obtain criminal conviction records of a household member from an appropriate law enforcement agency on your behalf in connection with lease enforcement or eviction.</P>
            <P>(i) Your request must include a copy of the consent form, signed by the household member.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such criminal conviction records in connection with eviction, your request must include your standards for evicting drug criminals in accordance with § 5.857, and for evicting other criminals in accordance with § 5.858.</P>
            <P>(iii) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such criminal conviction records for lease enforcement other than eviction, your request must include your standards for lease enforcement because of criminal activity by members of a household.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Fees.</E> If an owner requests a PHA to obtain criminal conviction records in accordance with this section, the PHA may charge the owner reasonable fees for making the request on behalf of the owner and for taking other actions for the owner.

The owner may not pass along to the applicant or tenant the costs of a criminal records check.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Permitted use and disclosure of criminal conviction records received by PHA</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use of records.</E> Criminal conviction records received by a PHA from a law enforcement agency in accordance with this section may only be used for the following purposes:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Applicant screening.</E> (A) PHA screening of applicants for admission to public housing (part 960 of this title);</P>
            <P>(B) PHA screening of applicants for admission to the Housing Choice Voucher Program (section 8 tenant-based assistance) (part 982 of this title);</P>
            <P>(C) PHA screening of applicants for admission to the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program (part 882 of this title); or the Section 8 project-based certificate or project-based voucher program (part 983 of this title); or</P>
            <P>(D) PHA screening concerning criminal conviction of applicants for admission to Section 8 project-based assistance, at the request of the owner. (For requirements governing use of criminal conviction records obtained by a PHA at the request of a Section 8 owner under this section, see paragraph (d) of this section.)</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lease enforcement and eviction.</E> (A) PHA enforcement of public housing leases and PHA eviction of public housing residents;</P>
            <P>(B) Enforcement of leases by a Section 8 project owner and eviction of residents by a Section 8 project owner. (However, criminal conviction records received by a PHA from a law enforcement agency under this section may not be used for lease enforcement or eviction of residents receiving Section 8 tenant-based assistance.)</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">PHA disclosure of records.</E> (i) A PHA may disclose the criminal conviction records which the PHA receives from a law enforcement agency only as follows:</P>
            <P>(A) To officers or employees of the PHA, or to authorized representatives of the PHA who have a job-related need to have access to the information. For example, if the PHA is seeking to evict a public housing tenant on the basis of criminal activity as shown in criminal conviction records provided by a law enforcement agency, the records may be disclosed to PHA employees performing functions related to the eviction, or to a PHA hearing officer conducting an administrative grievance hearing concerning the proposed eviction.</P>

            <P>(B) To the owner for use in connection with judicial eviction proceedings by the owner to the extent necessary in <PRTPAGE P="121"/>connection with a judicial eviction proceeding. For example, criminal conviction records may be included in pleadings or other papers filed in an eviction action, may be disclosed to parties to the action or the court, and may be filed in court or offered as evidence.</P>
            <P>(ii) This disclosure may be made only if the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(A) If the PHA has determined that criminal activity by the household member as shown by such records received from a law enforcement agency may be a basis for eviction from a Section 8 unit; and</P>
            <P>(B) If the owner certifies in writing that it will use the criminal conviction records only for the purpose and only to the extent necessary to seek eviction in a judicial proceeding of a Section 8 tenant based on the criminal activity by the household member that is described in the criminal conviction records.</P>
            <P>(iii) The PHA may rely on an owner's certification that the criminal record is necessary to proceed with a judicial eviction to evict the tenant based on criminal activity of the identified household member, as shown in the criminal conviction record.</P>
            <P>(iv) Upon disclosure as necessary in connection with judicial eviction proceedings, the PHA is not responsible for controlling access to or knowledge of such records after such disclosure.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Opportunity to dispute.</E> If a PHA obtains criminal record information from a State or local agency under this section showing that a household member has been convicted of a crime relevant to applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant or tenant a copy of such information, and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the information. This opportunity must be provided before a denial of admission, eviction or lease enforcement action on the basis of such information.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Records management.</E> Consistent with the limitations on disclosure of records in paragraph (e) of this section, the PHA must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any criminal record received by the PHA from a law enforcement agency is:</P>
            <P>(1) Maintained confidentially;</P>
            <P>(2) Not misused or improperly disseminated; and</P>
            <P>(3) Destroyed, once the purpose(s) for which the record was requested has been accomplished, including expiration of the period for filing a challenge to the PHA action without institution of a challenge or final disposition of any such litigation.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Penalties for improper release of information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Criminal penalty.</E> Conviction for a misdemeanor and imposition of a penalty of not more than $5,000 is the potential for:</P>
            <P>(i) Any person, including an officer, employee, or authorized representative of any PHA or of any project owner, who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any information concerning an applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance under the authority of this section under false pretenses; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Any person, including an officer, employee, or authorized representative of any PHA or a project owner, who knowingly and willfully discloses any such information in any manner to any individual not entitled under any law to receive the information.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Civil liability.</E> (i) A PHA may be held liable to any applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance affected by either of the following:</P>
            <P>(A) A negligent or knowing disclosure of criminal records information obtained under the authority of this section about such person by an officer, employee, or authorized representative of the PHA if the disclosure is not authorized by this section; or</P>
            <P>(B) Any other negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with this section.</P>

            <P>(ii) An applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance may seek relief against a PHA in these circumstances by bringing a civil action for damages and such other relief as may be appropriate against the PHA responsible for such unauthorized action.

            <SUBJECT>What special authority is there to obtain access to sex offender registration information?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">PHA obligation to obtain sex offender registration information.</E> (1) A PHA that administers a Section 8 or public housing program under an Annual Contributions Contract with HUD must carry out background checks necessary to determine whether a member of a household applying for admission to any federally assisted housing program is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. This check must be carried out with respect to the State in which the housing is located and with respect to States where members of the applicant household are known to have resided.</P>
            <P>(2) If the PHA requests such information from any State or local agency responsible for the collection or maintenance of such information, the State or local agency must promptly provide the PHA such information in its possession or control.</P>
            <P>(3) The State or local agency may charge a reasonable fee for providing the information.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Owner's request for sex offender registration information</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> An owner of federally assisted housing that is located in the jurisdiction of a PHA that administers a Section 8 or public housing program under an Annual Contributions Contract with HUD may request that the PHA obtain information necessary to determine whether a household member is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration requirement.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> If the request is made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) The PHA must request the information from a State or local agency;</P>
            <P>(ii) The State or local agency must promptly provide the PHA such information in its possession or control;</P>
            <P>(iii) The PHA must determine whether such information may be a basis for applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction, based on the criteria used by the owner as specified in the owner's request, and inform the owner of the determination.</P>
            <P>(iv) The PHA must notify the owner of its determination whether sex offender registration information received by the PHA under this section concerning a household member may be a basis for applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction in accordance with HUD requirements and the criteria used by the owner.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Contents of request.</E> As the owner, your request must specify whether you are asking the PHA to obtain the sex offender registration information concerning the household member for applicant screening, for lease enforcement, or for eviction and include the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) Addresses or other information about where members of the household are known to have lived.</P>
            <P>(ii) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such sex offender registration information for applicant screening, your request must include your standards in accordance with § 5.855(c) for prohibiting admission of persons subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement.</P>
            <P>(iii) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such sex offender registration information for eviction, your request must include your standards for evicting persons subject to a lifetime registration requirement in accordance with § 5.858.</P>
            <P>(iv) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such sex offender registration information for lease enforcement other than eviction, your request must include your standards for lease enforcement because of criminal activity by members of a household.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">PHA disclosure of records.</E> The PHA must not disclose to the owner any sex offender registration information obtained by the PHA under this section.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Fees.</E> If an owner asks a PHA to obtain sex offender registration information concerning a household member in accordance with this section, the PHA may charge the owner reasonable <PRTPAGE P="123"/>fees for making the request on behalf of the owner and for taking other actions for the owner. The PHA may require the owner to reimburse costs incurred by the PHA, including reimbursement of any fees charged to the PHA by a State or local agency for releasing the information, the PHA's own related staff and administrative costs. The owner may not pass along to the applicant or tenant the costs of a sex offender registration records check.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records management.</E> (1) The PHA must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any sex offender registration information record received by the PHA from a State or local agency under this section is:</P>
            <P>(i) Maintained confidentially;</P>
            <P>(ii) Not misused or improperly disseminated; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Destroyed, once the purpose for which the record was requested has been accomplished, including expiration of the period for filing a challenge to the PHA action without institution of a challenge or final disposition of any such litigation.</P>
            <P>(2) The records management requirements do not apply to information that is public information, or is obtained by a PHA other than under this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Opportunity to dispute.</E> If a PHA obtains sex offender registration information from a State or local agency under paragraph (a) of this section showing that a household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record, and the applicant or tenant, with a copy of such information, and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the information. This opportunity must be provided before a denial of admission, eviction or lease enforcement action on the basis of such information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) This subpart addresses the protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are applying for, or are the beneficiaries of, assistance under a HUD program covered by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 13925 and 42 U.S.C. 14043e <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (“covered housing program,” as defined in § 5.2003). Notwithstanding the title of the statute, protections are not limited to women but cover victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Consistent with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements at 24 CFR 5.105(a), victims cannot be discriminated against on the basis of any protected characteristic, including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age. HUD programs must also be operated consistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule at § 5.105(a)(2), which requires that HUD-assisted and HUD-insured housing are made available to all otherwise eligible individuals and families regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.</P>

            <P>(b)(1) The applicable assistance provided under a covered housing program generally consists of two types of assistance (one or both may be provided): Tenant-based rental assistance, which is rental assistance that is provided to the tenant; and project-based assistance, which is assistance that attaches to the unit in which the tenant resides. For project-based assistance, the assistance may consist of such assistance as operating assistance, development <PRTPAGE P="125"/>assistance, and mortgage interest rate subsidy.</P>
            <P>(2) The regulations in this subpart are supplemented by the specific regulations for the HUD-covered housing programs listed in § 5.2003. The program-specific regulations address how certain VAWA requirements are to be implemented and whether they can be implemented (for example, reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance as provided in § 5.2009(b)) for the applicable covered housing program, given the statutory and regulatory framework for the program. When there is conflict between the regulations of this subpart and the program-specific regulations, the program-specific regulations govern. Where assistance is provided under more than one covered housing program and there is a conflict between VAWA protections or remedies under those programs, the individual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or remedies under any or all of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and permissible under each of the program statutes.</P>

            <P>(2) Nothing in this section limits any available authority of a covered housing provider to evict or terminate assistance to a tenant for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is in question against the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant. However, the covered housing provider must not subject the tenant, who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or is affiliated with an individual who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, to a more demanding standard than other tenants in determining whether to evict or terminate assistance.</P>
            <P>(3) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a covered housing provider to terminate assistance to or evict a tenant under a covered housing program if the covered housing provider can demonstrate an actual and imminent threat to other tenants or those employed at or providing service to property of the covered housing provider would be present if that tenant or lawful occupant is not evicted or terminated from assistance. In this context, words, gestures, actions, or other indicators will be considered an “actual and imminent threat” if they meet the standards provided in the definition of “actual and imminent threat” in § 5.2003.</P>
            <P>(4) Any eviction or termination of assistance, as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section should be utilized by a covered housing provider only when there are no other actions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat, including, but not limited to, transferring the victim to a different unit, barring the perpetrator from the property, contacting law enforcement to increase police presence or develop other plans to keep the property safe, or seeking other legal remedies to prevent the perpetrator from acting on a threat. Restrictions predicated on public safety cannot be based on stereotypes, but must be tailored to particularized concerns about individual residents.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Emergency transfer plan.</E> Each covered housing provider, as identified in the program-specific regulations for the covered housing program, shall adopt an emergency transfer plan, no later than June 14, 2017 based on HUD's model emergency transfer plan, in accordance with the following:</P>
            <P>(1) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Internal emergency transfer</E> refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant would not be categorized as a new applicant; that is, the tenant may reside in the new unit without having to undergo an application process.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">External emergency transfer</E> refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant would be categorized as a new applicant; that is the tenant must undergo an application process in order to reside in the new unit.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Safe unit</E> refers to a unit that the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking believes is safe.</P>
            <P>(2) The emergency transfer plan must provide that a tenant receiving rental assistance through, or residing in a unit subsidized under, a covered housing program who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking qualifies for an emergency transfer if:</P>
            <P>(i) The tenant expressly requests the transfer; and</P>
            <P>(ii)(A) The tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying; or</P>

            <P>(B) In the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual assault, either the tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying, or the sexual <PRTPAGE P="129"/>assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer.</P>
            <P>(3) The emergency transfer plan must detail the measure of any priority given to tenants who qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA in relation to other categories of tenants seeking transfers and individuals seeking placement on waiting lists.</P>
            <P>(4) The emergency transfer plan must incorporate strict confidentiality measures to ensure that the covered housing provider does not disclose the location of the dwelling unit of the tenant to a person who committed or threatened to commit an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against the tenant.</P>
            <P>(5) The emergency transfer plan must allow a tenant to make an internal emergency transfer under VAWA when a safe unit is immediately available.</P>
            <P>(6) The emergency transfer plan must describe policies for assisting a tenant in making an internal emergency transfer under VAWA when a safe unit is not immediately available, and these policies must ensure that requests for internal emergency transfers under VAWA receive, at a minimum, any applicable additional priority that housing providers may already provide to other types of emergency transfer requests.</P>
            <P>(7) The emergency transfer plan must describe reasonable efforts the covered housing provider will take to assist a tenant who wishes to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately available. The plan must include policies for assisting a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer under VAWA out of the covered housing provider's program or project, and a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer under VAWA into the covered housing provider's program or project. These policies may include:</P>
            <P>(i) Arrangements, including memoranda of understanding, with other covered housing providers to facilitate moves; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Outreach activities to organizations that assist or provide resources to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</P>
            <P>(8) Nothing may preclude a tenant from seeking an internal emergency transfer and an external emergency transfer concurrently if a safe unit is not immediately available.</P>
            <P>(9) Where applicable, the emergency transfer plan must describe policies for a tenant who has tenant-based rental assistance and who meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to move quickly with that assistance.</P>
            <P>(10) The emergency transfer plan may require documentation from a tenant seeking an emergency transfer, provided that:</P>
            <P>(i) The tenant's submission of a written request to the covered housing provider, where the tenant certifies that they meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, shall be sufficient documentation of the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;</P>
            <P>(ii) The covered housing provider may, at its discretion, ask an individual seeking an emergency transfer to document the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, in accordance with § 5.2007, for which the individual is seeking the emergency transfer, if the individual has not already provided documentation of that occurrence; and</P>
            <P>(iii) No other documentation is required to qualify the tenant for an emergency transfer.</P>
            <P>(11) The covered housing provider must make its emergency transfer plan available upon request and, when feasible, must make its plan publicly available.</P>
            <P>(12) The covered housing provider must keep a record of all emergency transfers requested under its emergency transfer plan, and the outcomes of such requests, and retain these records for a period of three years, or for a period of time as specified in program regulations. Requests and outcomes of such requests must be reported to HUD annually.</P>
            <P>(13) Nothing in this paragraph (e) may be construed to supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered housing program.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for documentation.</E> (1) Under a covered housing program, if an applicant or tenant represents to the covered housing provider that the individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking entitled to the protections under § 5.2005, or remedies under § 5.2009, the covered housing provider may request, in writing, that the applicant or tenant submit to the covered housing provider the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If an applicant or tenant does not provide the documentation requested under paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 14 business days after the date that the tenant receives a request in writing for such documentation from the covered housing provider, nothing in § 5.2005 or § 5.2009, which addresses the protections of VAWA, may be construed to limit the authority of the covered housing provider to:</P>
            <P>(A) Deny admission by the applicant or tenant to the covered housing program;</P>

            <P>(i) The certification form described in § 5.2005(a)(1)(ii); or</P>
            <P>(ii) A document:</P>
            <P>(A) Signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, an attorney, or medical professional, or a mental health professional (collectively, “professional”) from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse;</P>
            <P>(B) Signed by the applicant or tenant; and</P>
            <P>(C) That specifies, under penalty of perjury, that the professional believes in the occurrence of the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for protection and remedies under this subpart, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under § 5.2003; or</P>
            <P>(iii) A record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency; or</P>
            <P>(iv) At the discretion of a covered housing provider, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant or tenant.</P>
            <P>(2) If a covered housing provider receives documentation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that contains conflicting information (including certification forms from two or more members of a household each claiming to be a victim and naming one or more of the other petitioning household members as the perpetrator), the covered housing provider may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), or (b)(1)(iv) of this section, within 30 calendar days of the date of the request for the third-party documentation.</P>
            <P>(3) Nothing in this paragraph (b) shall be construed to require a covered housing provider to request that an individual submit documentation of the status of the individual as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> Any information submitted to a covered housing provider under this section, including the <PRTPAGE P="131"/>fact that an individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (confidential information), shall be maintained in strict confidence by the covered housing provider.</P>

            <P>(1) The covered housing provider shall not allow any individual administering assistance on behalf of the covered housing provider or any persons within their employ (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> contractors) or in the employ of the covered housing provider to have access to confidential information unless explicitly authorized by the covered housing provider for reasons that specifically call for these individuals to have access to this information under applicable Federal, State, or local law.</P>
            <P>(2) The covered housing provider shall not enter confidential information described in paragraph (c) of this section into any shared database or disclose such information to any other entity or individual, except to the extent that the disclosure is:</P>
            <P>(i) Requested or consented to in writing by the individual in a time-limited release</P>
            <P>(ii) Required for use in an eviction proceeding or hearing regarding termination of assistance from the covered program; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Otherwise required by applicable law.</P>
            <P>(d) A covered housing provider's compliance with the protections of §§ 5.2005 and 5.2009, based on documentation received under this section shall not be sufficient to constitute evidence of an unreasonable act or omission by the covered housing provider. However, nothing in this paragraph (d) of this section shall be construed to limit the liability of a covered housing provider for failure to comply with §§ 5.2005 and 5.2009.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lease bifurcation.</E> (1) A covered housing provider may in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, bifurcate a lease, or remove a household member from a lease in order to evict, remove, terminate occupancy rights, or terminate assistance to such member who engages in criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other individual:</P>
            <P>(i) Without regard to whether the household member is a signatory to the lease; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Without evicting, removing, terminating assistance to, or otherwise penalizing a victim of such criminal activity who is also a tenant or lawful occupant.</P>
            <P>(2) A lease bifurcation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall be carried out in accordance with any requirements or procedures as may be prescribed by Federal, State, or local law for termination of assistance or leases and in accordance with any requirements under the relevant covered housing program.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance or find alternative housing following bifurcation of a lease</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The reasonable time to establish eligibility under a covered housing program or find alternative housing is specified in paragraph (b) of this section, or alternatively in the program-specific regulations governing the applicable covered housing program. Some covered housing programs may provide different time frames than are specified in this paragraph (b), and in such cases, the program-specific regulations govern.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasonable time to establish eligibility assistance or find alternative housing.</E> (i) If a covered housing provider exercises the option to bifurcate a lease as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and the individual who was evicted or for whom assistance was terminated was the eligible tenant under the covered housing program, the covered housing provider shall provide to any remaining tenant or tenants that were not already eligible a period of 90 calendar days from the date of bifurcation of the lease to:</P>
            <P>(A) Establish eligibility for the same covered housing program under which the evicted or terminated tenant was the recipient of assistance at the time of bifurcation of the lease; or</P>

            <P>(C) Find alternative housing.<PRTPAGE P="132"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) The 90-calendar-day period provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this section will not be available to a remaining household member if the statutory requirements for the covered housing program prohibit it. The 90-day calendar period also will not apply beyond the expiration of a lease, unless this is permitted by program regulations. The 90-calendar-day period is the total period provided to a remaining tenant to establish eligibility under the three options provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) The covered housing provider may extend the 90-calendar-day period in paragraph (b)(2) of this section up to an additional 60 calendar days, unless prohibited from doing so by statutory requirements of the covered program or unless the time period would extend beyond expiration of the lease.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Efforts to promote housing stability for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</E> Covered housing providers are encouraged to undertake whatever actions permissible and feasible under their respective programs to assist individuals residing in their units who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to remain in their units or other units under the covered housing program or other covered housing providers, and for the covered housing provider to bear the costs of any transfer, where permissible.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to implement the provisions of section 109 of title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (Title I) (42 U.S.C. 5309). Section 109 provides that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance. Section 109 does not directly prohibit discrimination on the bases of age or disability, and the regulations in this part 6 do not apply to age or disability discrimination in Title I programs. Instead, section 109 directs that the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) (Age Discrimination Act) and the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (Section 504) apply to programs or activities funded in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance. Thus, the <PRTPAGE P="133"/>regulations of 24 CFR part 8, which implement Section 504 for HUD programs, and the regulations of 24 CFR part 146, which implement the Age Discrimination Act for HUD programs, apply to disability and age discrimination in Title I programs.</P>

            <P>(a) This part applies to any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, including Community Development Block Grants—Entitlement, State and HUD-Administered Small Cities, and Section 108 Loan Guarantees; Urban Development Action Grants; Economic Development Initiative Grants; and Special Purpose Grants.</P>
            <P>(b) The provisions of this part and sections 104(b)(2) and 109 of Title I that relate to discrimination on the basis of race shall not apply to the provision of Federal financial assistance by grantees under this title to the Hawaiian Homelands (42 U.S.C. 5309).</P>
            <P>(c) The provisions of this part and sections 104(b)(2) and 109 of Title I that relate to discrimination on the basis of race and national origin shall not apply to the provision of Federal financial assistance to grant recipients under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 4101). See also, 24 CFR 1003.601(a).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 109 requires that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.</P>
            <P>(1) A Recipient under any program or activity to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, take any of the following actions on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny any individual any facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program or activity;</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide any facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits that are different, or are provided in a different form, from that provided to others under the program or activity;</P>
            <P>(iii) Subject an individual to segregated or separate treatment in any facility, or in any matter of process related to the receipt of any service or benefit under the program or activity;</P>
            <P>(iv) Restrict an individual's access to, or enjoyment of, any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others in connection with facilities, services, financial aid or other benefits under the program or activity;</P>
            <P>(v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether the individual satisfies any admission, enrollment, eligibility, membership, or other requirements or conditions that the individual must meet in order to be provided any facilities, services, or other benefit provided under the program or activity;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in a program or activity as an employee;</P>
            <P>(vii) Aid or otherwise perpetuate discrimination against an individual by providing Federal financial assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service;</P>
            <P>(viii) Otherwise limit an individual in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by other individuals receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service;</P>

            <P>(ix) Use criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to persons of a particular race, color, national origin, religion, or sex; or<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
            </P>
            <P>(x) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards.</P>
            <P>(2) In determining the site or location of housing, accommodations, or facilities, a Recipient may not make selections that have the effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The Recipient may not make selections that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of section 109 and of this part 6.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) In administering a program or activity in which the Recipient has discriminated on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion or sex, the Recipient must take any necessary steps to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the absence of discrimination, a Recipient, in administering a program or activity, may take any steps necessary to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.</P>
            <P>(iii) After a finding of noncompliance, or after a Recipient has reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has occurred, a Recipient shall not be prohibited by this section from taking any action eligible under subpart C of 24 CFR part 570 to ameliorate an imbalance in benefits, services or facilities provided to any geographic area or specific group of persons within its jurisdiction, where the purpose of such action is to remedy discriminatory practices or usage.</P>
            <P>(iv)(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this part, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit any Recipient from maintaining or constructing separate living facilities or restroom facilities for the different sexes in order to protect personal privacy or modesty concerns. Furthermore, selectivity on the basis of sex is not prohibited when institutional or custodial services can, in the interest of personal privacy or modesty, only be performed by a member of the same sex as those receiving the services.</P>
            <P>(B) Section 109 of the Act does not directly prohibit discrimination on the basis of age or disability, but directs that the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act and the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability under Section 504 apply to Title I programs and activities. Accordingly, for programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance, the regulations in this part 6 apply to discrimination on the bases of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex; the regulations at 24 CFR part 8 apply to discrimination on the basis of disability; and the regulations at 24 CFR part 146 apply to discrimination on the basis of age.</P>

Where information required of a Recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person, and that agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish this information, the Recipient shall so certify in any requested report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information. Failure or refusal to furnish pertinent information (whether maintained by the Recipient or some other agency, institution, or person) without a credible reason for the failure or refusal will be considered to be noncompliance under this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Filing a complaint</E>—(1) <E T="03">Who may file.</E> Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may file, or may have an authorized representative file on his or her behalf, a complaint with the Responsible Official. Any person who believes that any specific class of persons has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part and who is a member of that class or who is the authorized representative of a member of that class may file a complaint with the Responsible Official.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Confidentiality.</E> Generally, the Responsible Official shall hold in confidence the identity of any person submitting a complaint, unless the person submits written authorization otherwise. However, an exception to maintaining confidentiality of the identity of the person may be required to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or proceeding under this part.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">When to file.</E> Complaints shall be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination, unless the Responsible Official waives this time limit for good cause. For purposes of determining when a complaint is filed under this part, a complaint mailed to the Responsible Official via the U.S. Postal Service will be deemed filed on the date it is postmarked. A complaint delivered to the Responsible Official in any other manner will be deemed filed on the date it is received by the Responsible Official.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Where to file complaints.</E> Complaints must be in writing, signed, addressed to the Responsible Official, and filed with (mailed to or otherwise delivered to) the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at any HUD Office.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Content of complaints.</E> Each complaint should contain the complainant's name, address, and phone number; a description or name, if available, <PRTPAGE P="137"/>of the Recipient alleged to have violated this part; an address where the violation occurred; and a description of the Recipient's alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the Responsible Official of the nature and date of the alleged violation of this part.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Amendments to complaints.</E> Amendments to complaints, such as clarification and amplification of allegations in a complaint or the addition of other Recipients, may be made by the complainant or the complainant's authorized representative at any time while the complaint is being considered, and any amendment shall be deemed to be made as of the original filing date.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Notification.</E> To the extent practicable, the Responsible Official will notify the complainant and the Recipient of the Responsible Official's receipt of a complaint within 10 calendar days of receipt of a complete complaint. If the Responsible Official receives a complaint that is not complete, the Responsible Official will notify the complainant and specify the additional information that is needed to make the complaint complete. If the complainant fails to complete the complaint, the Responsible Official will close the complaint without prejudice and notify the complainant. When a complete complaint has been received, the Responsible Official, or his or her designee, will assess the complaint for acceptance, rejection, or referral to an appropriate Federal agency within 20 calendar days.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Resolution of complaints.</E> After the acceptance of a complete complaint, the Responsible Official will investigate the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and, if resolution is not achieved, the Responsible Official will notify the Recipient and complainant, to the extent practicable within 180 days of the receipt of the complete complaint, of the results of the investigation in a letter of findings sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, containing the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Findings of fact and a finding of compliance or noncompliance;</P>
            <P>(ii) A description of an appropriate remedy for each violation believed to exist; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A notice of the right of the Recipient and the complainant to request a review of the letter of findings by the Responsible Official. A copy of the final investigative report will be made available upon request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance reviews</E>—(1) <E T="03">Periodic compliance reviews.</E> The Responsible Official may periodically review the practices of Recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part and may conduct on-site reviews. The Responsible Official will initiate an on-site review by sending to the Recipient a letter advising the Recipient of the practices to be reviewed; the programs affected by the review; and the opportunity, at any time before a final determination, to submit information that explains, validates, or otherwise addresses the practices under review. In addition, the Award Official will include, in normal program compliance reviews and monitoring procedures, appropriate actions to review and monitor compliance with general or specific program requirements designed to implement the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Time period of the review.</E> (i) For the Entitlement program, compliance reviews will cover the three years before the date of the review.</P>

            <P>(ii) For the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program, the compliance review is applicable only to UDAG loan repayments or other payments or revenues classified as program income. UDAG repayments or other payments or revenues classified as miscellaneous revenue are not subject to compliance review under this part. (<E T="03">See</E> 24 CFR 570.500(a).) The compliance review will cover the time period that program income is being repaid.</P>
            <P>(iii) For the State and HUD-Administered Small Cities programs, the compliance review will cover the four years before the date of the review.</P>
            <P>(iv) For all other programs, the time period covered by the review will be four years before the date of the review.</P>

            <P>(v) On a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the Responsible Official, the above time frames for review can be expanded where facts or allegations warrant further investigation.<PRTPAGE P="138"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Early compliance resolution.</E> On the last day of the on-site visit, after the compliance review, the Recipient will be given an opportunity to supplement the record. Additionally, a prefinding conference may be held and a summary of the proposed findings may be presented to the Recipient. In those instances where the issue(s) cannot be resolved at a prefinding conference or with the supplemental information, a meeting will be scheduled to attempt a voluntary settlement.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Notification of findings.</E> (i) The Assistant Secretary will notify the Recipient of Federal financial assistance of the results of the compliance review in a letter of findings sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Letter of findings.</E> The letter of findings will include the findings of fact and the conclusions of law; a description of a remedy for each violation found; and a notice that a copy of HUD's final report concerning its compliance review will be made available, upon request, to the Recipient.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to a review of the letter of findings.</E> (1) Within 30 days of receipt of the letter of findings, any party may request that a review be made of the letter of findings, by mailing or delivering to the Responsible Official, Room 5100, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD, Washington, DC 20410, a written statement of the reasons why the letter of findings should be modified.</P>
            <P>(2) The Responsible Official will send by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the request for review to all parties. Parties other than the party requesting review and HUD shall have 20 days from receipt to respond to the request for review.</P>
            <P>(3) The Responsible Official will either sustain or modify the letter of findings or require that further investigation be conducted, within 60 days of the request for review. The Responsible Official's decision shall constitute the formal determination of compliance or noncompliance.</P>
            <P>(4) If no party requests that the letter of findings be reviewed, the Responsible Official, within 14 calendar days of the expiration of the time period in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, will send a formal written determination of compliance or noncompliance to all parties.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Voluntary compliance time limits.</E> The Recipient will have 10 calendar days from receipt of the letter of findings of noncompliance, or such other reasonable time as specified in the letter, within which to agree, in writing, to come into voluntary compliance or to contact the Responsible Official for settlement discussions. If the Recipient fails to meet this deadline, HUD will proceed in accordance with §§ 6.12 and 6.13.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Informal resolution/voluntary compliance</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> It is the policy of HUD to encourage the informal resolution of matters. A complaint or a compliance review may be resolved by informal means at any time. If a letter of findings is issued, and the letter makes a finding of noncompliance, the Responsible Official will attempt to resolve the matter through a voluntary compliance agreement.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Objectives of informal resolution/voluntary compliance.</E> In attempting informal resolution, the Responsible Official will attempt to achieve a just resolution of the matter and to obtain assurances, where appropriate, that the Recipient will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of any complainant, and will take such action as will assure the elimination of any violation of this part or the prevention of the occurrence of such violation in the future. If a finding of noncompliance has been made, the terms of such an informal resolution shall be reduced to a written voluntary compliance agreement, signed by the Recipient and the Responsible Official, and be made part of the file. Such voluntary compliance agreements shall seek to protect the interests of the complainant (if any), other persons similarly situated, and the public.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Right to file a private civil action.</E> At any time in the process, the complainant has the right to file a private civil action. If the complainant does so, the Responsible Official has the discretion to administratively close the investigation or continue the investigation, if he or she decides that it is in the best interests of the Department to do so. If the Responsible Official makes a finding of noncompliance and <PRTPAGE P="139"/>an agreement to voluntarily comply is not obtained from the Recipient, the procedures at §§ 6.12 and 6.13 for effecting compliance shall be followed.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.</E> No Recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding, or hearing under this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedure for effecting compliance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that a Recipient of Federal financial assistance has failed to comply with Section 109(a) or this part and voluntary compliance efforts have failed, the Secretary will notify the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the findings of noncompliance and will request that the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer secure compliance. If within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, the Secretary will:</P>
            <P>(1) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;</P>
            <P>(2) Exercise the powers and functions provided by Title VI;</P>
            <P>(3) Terminate or reduce payments under Title I, or limit the availability of payments under Title I to programs or activities not affected by the failure to comply; or</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination, reduction, or limitation of the availability of Title I payments.</E> No order terminating, reducing, or limiting the availability of Title I payments under this part shall become effective until:</P>
            <P>(1) The Secretary has notified the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the Recipient's failure to comply in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments to be taken;</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;</P>
            <P>(3) The Recipient has been extended an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with § 6.13(a); and</P>
            <P>(4) A final agency notice or decision has been rendered in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section or 24 CFR part 180.</P>
            <P>(c) If a Recipient does not respond to the notice of opportunity for a hearing or does not elect to proceed with a hearing within 20 days of the issuance of the Secretary's actions listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, then the Secretary's approval of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments is considered a final agency notice and the Recipient may seek judicial review in accordance with section 111(c) of the Act.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C 794), to the end that no otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States shall, solely by reason of his or her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This part also implements section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5309). This part does not effectuate section 504 as it applies to any program or activity conducted by the Department. Compliance with this part does not assure compliance with requirements for accessibility by physically-handicapped persons imposed under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157; 24 CFR part 40).</P>
            <P>(b) The policies and standards for compliance established by this part are established in contemplation of, and with a view to enforcement through, the Department's administration of programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance and the administrative procedures described in subpart D (including, without limitation, judicial enforcement under § 8.57(a)).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>As used in this part:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Accessible,</E> when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of the facility when designed, constructed or altered, can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. The phrase <E T="03">accessible to and usable by</E> is synonomous with accessible.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Accessible,</E> when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means <PRTPAGE P="141"/>that the unit is located on an accessible route and when designed, constructed, altered or adapted can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in § 8.32 is <E T="03">accessible</E> within the meaning of this paragraph. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with handicaps (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same recipient, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Accessible route</E> means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces in a building or facility that complies with the space and reach requirements of applicable standards prescribed by § 8.32. An accessible route that serves only accessible units occupied by persons with hearing or vision impairments need not comply with those requirements intended to effect accessibility for persons with mobility impairments.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Adaptability</E> means the ability of certain elements of a dwelling unit, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added to, raised, lowered, or otherwise altered, to accommodate the needs of persons with or without handicaps, or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability. For example, in a unit adaptable for a hearing-impaired person, the wiring for visible emergency alarms may be installed but the alarms need not be installed until such time as the unit is made ready for occupancy by a hearing-impaired person.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Alteration</E> means any change in a facility or its permanent fixtures or equipment. It includes, but is not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, changes or rearrangements in structural parts and extraordinary repairs. It does not include normal maintenance or repairs, reroofing, interior decoration, or changes to mechanical systems.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Applicant for assistance</E> means one who submits an application, request, plan, or statement required to be approved by a Department official or by a primary recipient as a condition of eligibility for Federal financial assistance. An application means such a request, plan or statement.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Auxiliary aids</E> means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. For example, auxiliary aids for persons with impaired vision may include readers, Brailled materials, audio recordings, and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids for persons with impaired hearing may include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's), interpreters, notetakers, written materials, and other similar services and devices.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Department</E> or <E T="03">HUD</E> means the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Facility</E> means all or any portion of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, rolling stock or other real or personal property or interest in the property.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Federal financial assistance</E> means any assistance provided or otherwise made available by the Department through any grant, loan, contract or any other arrangement, in the form of:</P>
            <P>(a) Funds;</P>
            <P>(b) Services of Federal personnel; or</P>
            <P>(c) Real or personal property or any interest in or use of such property, including:</P>
            <P>(1) Transfers or leases of the property for less than fair market value or for reduced consideration; and</P>
            <P>(2) Proceeds from a subsequent transfer or lease of the property if the Federal share of its fair market value is not returned to the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Federal financial assistance</E> includes community development funds in the form of proceeds from loans guaranteed under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, <PRTPAGE P="142"/>as amended, but does not include assistance made available through direct Federal procurement contracts or payments made under these contracts or any other contract of insurance or guaranty.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Handicap</E> means any condition or characteristic that renders a person an individual with handicaps.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Historic preservation programs or activities</E> means programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.</P>
            <P>

            <P>
              <E T="03">Individual with handicaps</E> means any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment.

For purposes of other programs and activities, the term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents the individual from participating in the program or activity in question, or whose participation, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others.

            <P>(1) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit one or more major life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such a limitation;</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 8.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, solely on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) A recipient, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, solely on the basis of handicap:</P>
            <P>(i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the housing, aid, benefit, or service;</P>
            <P>(ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded to others;</P>
            <P>(iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording the individual an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;</P>
            <P>(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps from that provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with handicaps with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others.</P>
            <P>(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual with handicaps by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries in the recipient's federally assisted program or activity;</P>
            <P>(vi) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;</P>
            <P>(vii) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter or a person residing in or intending and eligible to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or</P>
            <P>(viii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by other qualified individuals receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with handicaps and non-handicapped persons, but must afford individuals with handicaps equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement.</P>

            <P>(3) A recipient may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in any federally assisted program or activity that is not separate or different despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.<PRTPAGE P="145"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) In any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would:</P>
            <P>(i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination solely on the basis of handicap;</P>
            <P>(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's federally assisted program or activity for qualified individuals with a particular handicap involved in the program or activity, unless the recipient can demonstrate that the criteria or methods of administration are manifestly related to the accomplishment of an objective of a program or activity; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.</P>
            <P>(5) In determining the site or location of a federally assisted facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections the purpose or effect of which would:</P>
            <P>(i) Exclude qualified individuals with handicaps from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under, any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department, or</P>
            <P>(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to qualified individuals with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(6) As used in this section, the housing, aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any housing, aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, altered, leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) Non-handicapped persons may be excluded from the benefits of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or executive order to individuals with handicaps. A specific class of individuals with handicaps may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals.</P>

            <P>(2) Certain Department programs operate under statutory definitions of <E T="03">handicapped person</E> that are more restrictive than the definition of <E T="03">individual with handicaps</E> contained in § 8.3. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation.</P>
            <P>(d) Recipients shall administer programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps.</P>
            <P>(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on handicap, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with handicaps to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.</P>
            <P>(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

            <P>(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose, or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations, or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and</P>
            <P>(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential (as provided in paragraph (d) of this section), that refusal to provide the information will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that the information will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted before the employee's entrance on duty if all entering employees in that category of job classification must take such an examination regardless of handicap, and the results of such examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) Information obtained under this section concerning the medical condition or history of the applicant is to be collected and maintained on separate forms that are accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:</P>
            <P>(1) Supervisors and managers may be informed of restrictions on the work or duties of individuals with handicaps and informed of necessary accommodations;</P>
            <P>(2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed if the condition might require emergency treatment; and</P>

For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase <E T="03">to the maximum extent feasible</E> shall not be interpreted as requiring that a recipient make a non-housing facility, or element thereof, accessible if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient's program or activity.</P>

A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section.

In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 8.21(c)(1)(ii) or (iii), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible; assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or adopting other innovative methods.</P>

If the PHA currently has no accessible units or if the PHA or HUD determines that information regarding the availability of accessible units has not been communicated sufficiently so that, as a result, the number of eligible qualified individuals with handicaps on the waiting list is not fairly representative of the number of such persons in the area, the PHA's assessment shall include the needs of eligible qualified individuals with handicaps in the area.

To this end, when an accessible unit becomes vacant, the owner or manager before offering such units to a non-handicapped applicant shall offer such unit:</P>
            <P>(1) First, to a current occupant of another unit of the same project, or comparable projects under common control, having handicaps requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying a unit not having such features, or, if no such occupant exists, then</P>

The terms of such an informal resolution shall be reduced to a written voluntary compliance agreement, signed by the recipient and the responsible civil rights official, and be made part of the file for the matter. Such voluntary compliance agreements shall seek to protect the interests of the complainant (if any), other persons similarly situated, and the public interest.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.</E> No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of investigation, hearing or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.</P>

            <P>(4) The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate, or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice to State or local government.</E> Whenever the Secretary determines that a State or unit of general local government which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301-5318) has failed to comply with a requirement of this part with respect to a program or activity funded in whole or in part with such assistance, the Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State or the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of the noncompliance and shall request the Governor or the chief executive officer to secure compliance. The notice shall be given at least sixty days before:</P>
            <P>(1) An order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance becomes effective under paragraph (c) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(2) Any action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</P>

            <FP>However, this paragraph shall not be construed to prevent an award official from utilizing appropriate procedures and sanctions established under the program to assure or secure compliance with a specific requirement of the program designed to effectuate the objectives of this part.</FP>

A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in § 9.151 is “accessible” within the meaning of this definition. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with disabilities (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same agency, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.</P>
          <P>

          <P>(a) No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) The agency, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability—</P>
          <P>(i) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service;</P>
          <P>(ii) Afford a qualified individual with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;</P>
          <P>(iii) Provide a qualified individual with disabilities with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;</P>
          <P>(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;</P>
          <P>(v) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;</P>
          <P>(vi) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a disability of that buyer or renter or a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or</P>
          <P>(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with disabilities in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service.</P>
          <P>(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and for persons without disabilities, but must afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement.</P>

          <P>(3) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in programs or <PRTPAGE P="166"/>activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of programs or activities that are permissibly separate or different for persons with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(4) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would:</P>
          <P>(i) Subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would:</P>
          <P>(i) Exclude individuals with disabilities from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or</P>
          <P>(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(6) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability.</P>
          <P>(7) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the agency establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, persons without disabilities may be excluded from the benefits of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with disabilities. A specific class of individuals with disabilities may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals.</P>
          <P>(2) Certain agency programs operate under statutory definitions of “persons with disabilities” that are more restrictive than the definition of “individual with disabilities” contained in § 9.103. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation.</P>
          <P>(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on disability, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.</P>
          <P>(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

          <P>(b) “Direct threat” means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.</P>
          <P>(c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This section does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic properties, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 9.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, also shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of July 18, 1994 except <PRTPAGE P="168"/>that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of July 18, 1994, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of July 18, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>
          <P>(e) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall apply to the Property Disposition Programs. However, this section does not require HUD to make alterations to existing facilities that are part of the Property Disposition Programs unless such alterations are necessary to meet the needs of a current or prospective tenant during the time when HUD expects to retain legal possession of the facilities, and there is no alternative method to meet the needs of that current or prospective tenant. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require alterations to make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities who are expected to occupy the facilities only after HUD relinquishes legal possession.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: alterations of Property Disposition Program multifamily housing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Substantial alteration.</E> If the agency undertakes alterations to a PDP multifamily housing project that has 15 or more units and the cost of the alterations is 75 percent or more of the replacement cost of the completed facility, then the project shall be designed and altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, shall be made accessible for persons with mobility impairments. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section is accessible for purposes of this section. An additional two percent of the units (but not less that one unit) in such a project shall be accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments. If state or local requirements for alterations require greater action than this paragraph, those requirements shall prevail.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Other alteration.</E> (1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, alterations to dwelling units in a PDP multifamily housing project shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. If alterations of single elements or spaces of a <PRTPAGE P="169"/>dwelling unit, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a dwelling unit, the entire dwelling unit shall be made accessible. Once five percent of the dwelling units in a project are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph. Once two percent of the dwelling units in a project are readily accessible to or usable by individuals with hearing or vision impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph.</P>
          <P>(2) Alterations to common areas or parts of facilities that affect accessibility of existing housing facilities, shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency may establish a higher percentage or number of accessible units than that prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section if the agency determines that there is a need for a higher percentage or number, based on census data or other available current data. In making such a determination, HUD shall take into account the expected needs of eligible persons with and without disabilities.</P>
          <P>(d) The definitions, requirements, and accessibility standards that apply to PDP multifamily housing projects covered by this section are those contained in the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility for the type of alteration being undertaken, and, in this case, the definitions, requirements and standards of the ADAAG shall apply.</P>
          <P>(e) With respect to multifamily housing projects operated by HUD, but in which HUD does not have an ownership interest, alterations under this section need not be made if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the multifamily housing project.</P>

To this end, when an accessible unit becomes vacant, the agency (or its management agent) before offering such units to an applicant without disabilities shall offer such unit:</P>
          <P>(1) First, to a current occupant of another unit of the same project, or comparable projects under common control, having disabilities requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying a unit not having such features, or, if no such occupant exists, then</P>
          <P>(2) Second, to an eligible qualified applicant on the waiting list having a disability requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit.</P>
          <P>(b) When offering an accessible unit to an applicant not having disabilities requiring the accessibility features of the unit, the agency may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessible unit when available.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall modify its housing policies and practices as they relate to PDP housing facilities to ensure that these policies and practices do not <PRTPAGE P="170"/>discriminate, on the basis of disability, against a qualified individual with disabilities. The agency may not impose upon individuals with disabilities other policies, such as the prohibition of assistive devices, auxiliary aids, alarms, or guides in housing facilities, that have the effect of limiting the participation of tenants with disabilities in any agency conducted housing program or activity in violation of this part. Housing policies that the agency can demonstrate are essential to the housing program or activity will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section if modifications would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative burdens.</P>
          <P>(b) The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.</P>
          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries or members of the public by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with § 9.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>

            <P>It is the policy of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide for public participation in rulemaking with respect to all HUD programs and functions, including matters that relate to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts even though such matters would not otherwise be subject to rulemaking by law or Executive policy. The Department therefore publishes notices of proposed rulemaking in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and gives interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, and arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation. It is the policy of the Department that its notices of proposed rulemaking are to afford the public not less than sixty days for submission of comments. For some rules the Secretary will employ additional methods of inviting public participation. These methods include, but are not limited to, publishing Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), conducting public surveys, and convening public forums or panels. An ANPR will be used to solicit public comment early in the rulemaking process for significant rules unless the Secretary grants an exception based upon legitimate and pressing time constraints. Unless required by statute, notice and public procedure will be omitted if the Department determines in a particular case or class of cases that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. In a particular case, the reasons for the determination shall be stated in the rulemaking document. Notice and public procedure may also be omitted with respect to statements of policy, interpretative rules, rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal practices or procedures, or if a statute expressly so authorizes. A final substantive rule will be published not less than 30 days before its effective date, unless it grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction or unless the rule itself states good cause for taking effect upon publication or less than 30 days thereafter. Statements of policy and interpretative rules will usually be made effective on the date of publication.</P>

They also explain how to apply for awards and the procedures and standards that the Department will use to make them.</P>

It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in subpart B of these rules, has been filed with the Department no later than 30 days after August 5, 1985, and to any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Eligibility of applicants.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term <E T="03">party</E> is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.</P>
            <P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</P>
            <P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), with not more than 500 employees;</P>
            <P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a), with not more than 500 employees; or</P>
            <P>(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</P>
            <P>(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated. For the purpose of eligibility of applicants before the HUD Board of Contract Appeals, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the applicant filed its appeal under 41 U.S.C. 606.</P>

            <P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an <E T="03">individual</E> rather than a <E T="03">sole owner of an unincorporated business</E> if the issues on which the application prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</P>
            <P>(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</P>

            <P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interests of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless <PRTPAGE P="178"/>the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</P>
            <P>(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards for awards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the agency includes, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an ineligible prevailing applicant because the agency's position was substantially justified is on the agency counsel, who may avoid an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.</P>
            <P>(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding, if the applicant has falsified the application (including documentation) or net worth exhibit or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Allowable fees and expenses.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75.00 per hour. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.</P>
            <P>(b) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:</P>
            <P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;</P>
            <P>(2) The prevailing rate for the kind and quality of services furnished in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;</P>
            <P>(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;</P>
            <P>(4) The time reasonably spent in the light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and</P>
            <P>(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.</P>
            <P>(c) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.</P>

The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Department should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Department will respond to the petition in accordance with 24 CFR 10.20(b).</P>

            <P>(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Department or other agencies that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.</P>
            <P>(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:</P>
            <P>(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or</P>
            <P>(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a).</P>
            <P>(c) If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, association, or organization, or a sole owner of an unincorporated business, the applicant shall state that it did not have more than 500 employees at the time the proceeding was initiated, giving the number of its employees and describing briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.</P>
            <P>(d) The application shall also itemize the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.</P>
            <P>(e) The application also may include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Department to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.</P>
            <P>(f) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer with respect to the eligibility of the applicant and by the attorney of the applicant with respect to fees and expenses sought. The application shall contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application and all accompanying material is true and complete to the best of the applicant's or authorized officer's information and belief.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Net worth exhibit.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or a qualified cooperative association must submit with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 14.120(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities, and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards of the Act and this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.</P>
            <P>(b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, occurring in the one-year period before the date on which the proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.</P>

            <P>(c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied <PRTPAGE P="180"/>by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1)-(9)), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Department's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act, 24 CFR part 15. In either case, disclosure shall be subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the Department's procedures implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 at 24 CFR part 16.</P>

            <P>(b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, agent or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed and describing the specific services performed.</P>
            <P>(c) The documentation shall also include a description of any expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided.

            <P>(a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Department's final disposition of the proceeding.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement of voluntary dismissal, become final and unappealable, both within the Department and to the courts.</P>
            <P>(c) If review or reconsideration (under HUD Board of Contract Appeals Rule 29, 24 CFR 20.10) is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.</P>

            <P>(b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.</P>
            <P>(c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency counsel's position.

            <P>(b) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.</P>
            <P>(c) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.</P>

            <P>(d) Whether special circumstances make an award unjust;</P>
            <P>(e) Whether the applicant during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct that unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy; and</P>
            <P>(f) The amounts, if any, awarded for fees and other expenses, with reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded.</P>
            <FP>If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.</FP>

If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Secretary (or his or her delegate, if any) does not take review on his or her own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Department in the same manner as a decision in the underlying proceeding becomes final. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the Secretary (or his or her delegate, if any). If review is taken, the Department will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making requests for records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any request for HUD records must be made in writing and submitted to the FOIA Public Liaison in the HUD field office where the records are located or to the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters if the request is for records located in HUD Headquarters.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD field office records.</E> Requests for records located in a HUD field office may be submitted by mail (including courier or delivery service), email, or facsimile to the FOIA Public Liaison at the field office.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">HUD headquarters records.</E> Requests for records located in HUD Headquarters may be submitted via an electronic request form on HUD's FOIA <PRTPAGE P="186"/>Web site at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov/FOIA.</E> Requests can also be submitted in person or by mail (including courier or delivery service), email, or facsimile to the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of requests.</E> FOIA requests should:</P>
            <P>(1) Be in writing and clearly identifiable as a FOIA request. To facilitate identification, the requester should place the phrase “FOIA Request” on the front of the envelope or on the cover sheet or other transmittal document used when submitting the request in person or by mail, email, facsimile, or electronic request form;</P>
            <P>(2) Include, whenever possible, detailed and specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The more specific the FOIA request for records, the more likely HUD officials will be able to locate the records requested. Requests for categories of information should be for specific and well-defined categories. Insufficient descriptions may lead HUD officials to contact the requester to seek additional information for their record search;</P>
            <P>(3) Indicate the form or format in which the requester would like the record made available, if the requester has a preference;</P>
            <P>(4) Specify the fee amount the requester is willing to pay. In general, HUD provides records at no cost up to $25. Requesters are required to agree to pay for any costs that exceed $25. Requesters may also request a dollar amount above which HUD should consult with them before they agree to pay the fee. If a requester seeks a fee waiver or reduction, the requester should include this request with the FOIA disclosure request and should describe, consistent with § 15.106(k), how the disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester;</P>
            <P>(5) Indicate the fee category that the requester believes applies to each of his or her requests (fee categories are defined in § 15.106(b));</P>
            <P>(6) Include verification information of the requester's identity, if the requester requests agency records pertaining to the requester, a minor, or an individual who is legally incompetent. Information about what constitutes acceptable verification information can be found in HUD's Privacy Act regulations in 24 CFR part 16;</P>
            <P>(7) Contain signed authorization from the other person, if the requester makes a request on another person's behalf for information about that person. If necessary, HUD will inform the requester of the authorization needed from the other person and give the requester an opportunity to provide such authorization. Requests for information about another person should be accompanied by either written, notarized authorization or proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary), or the request will be deemed insufficient; and</P>
            <P>(8) Contain a detailed explanation of the basis for the request, if the requester makes a request for expedited processing as provided by § 15.104(c). The requester should also include a statement certifying the truth of the circumstances alleged or other evidence, acceptable to HUD, of the requester's compelling need.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> HUD will generally make a determination whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days, depending on the size of the request. The 20-day period will begin on the day the request is received by the appropriate component of HUD, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is received by any component of HUD designated to receive FOIA requests.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Tolling the 20-day time period.</E> Under the OPEN Government Act of 2007, HUD may toll the 20-day period:</P>
            <P>(1) One time to make a reasonable request for additional information from the requester; or</P>

            <P>(2) As many times as necessary to clarify issues regarding fee assessment with the requester. The agency's receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request for information or <PRTPAGE P="187"/>resolution of all fee assessment issues ends the tolling period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Extension of time periods for processing a request.</E> In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, HUD may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request. In such circumstances, HUD will provide the requester with written notice setting forth the unusual circumstances for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. If processing a request would require more than 10 working days beyond the general time limit established in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will offer the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that HUD may process it within the extra 10-day working period or arrange an alternative time period within which the FOIA request will be processed. To aid the requester, HUD shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and HUD, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. For purposes of this section, unusual circumstances include:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect records not located in the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records; or</P>
            <P>(3) The need to consult with another agency or two or more HUD components having a substantial interest in the determination of the FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Aggregating multiple requests.</E> (1) HUD may aggregate multiple requests in cases where unusual circumstances exist and HUD determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) Certain requests from the same requester or from a group of requesters acting in concert actually constitute a single request; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The requests involve clearly related matters.</P>
            <P>(2) Aggregation of requests for this purpose will be conducted independent of aggregation of requests for fee purposes under § 15.106(h).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for processing FOIA requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> HUD will ordinarily respond to FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Tracking number.</E> FOIA requests will be logged in the order that they are received and be assigned a tracking number. A requester should use the tracking number to identify his or her request when contacting the FOIA office for any reason.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
            <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; or</P>
            <P>(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt determination, a request for expedited processing should be received by the proper office designated to receive FOIA requests as provided in § 15.102.</P>

            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing should submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester who makes a request under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, should establish that he or she is a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester making a request under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section also should establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.<PRTPAGE P="188"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) HUD will make a determination within 10 calendar days of receipt by the appropriate component of HUD, as provided in § 15.103, whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of HUD's determination. FOIA requests accepted for expedited processing will be processed as soon as practicable and on a priority basis.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> (1) For requests that do not qualify for expedited processing, HUD may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and complex FOIA requests based on the following: The time and work necessary to process the FOIA request and the volume of agency records responsive to the FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(2) When HUD uses multitrack processing, it may provide requesters in its slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of HUD's faster track. When HUD chooses to provide this option, HUD will contact the requester by telephone, letter, or email, whichever is more efficient in each case.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acknowledgements of requests.</E> The FOIA office in the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters and FOIA Public Liaison in each HUD field office will ordinarily send an acknowledgement letter to the requester that will confirm receipt of the request by the appropriate HUD office and provide an assigned tracking number, as provided by § 15.104(b), for further reference.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Consultations, coordination, and referrals.</E> When HUD receives a request for a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA or whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If HUD determines that it is best able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure, then it shall do so. If HUD determines that it is not best able to make that determination, then it shall either:</P>
            <P>(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or</P>
            <P>(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency that originated the record, but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency with which the record originated will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fee estimates.</E> HUD will notify the requester if HUD's estimate of the fee is more than the requester has agreed to pay. Consistent with § 15.106(e), the requester shall have 15 working days to agree to pay the higher fee.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Forms of response.</E> Once HUD makes a determination regarding whether to comply with a request pursuant to time limits established in § 15.103(a), HUD shall immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and the requester's right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Granting requests in whole or in part.</E> If HUD makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. HUD will make a record available in the form or format requested, if the record is readily reproducible in that format. HUD will inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 15.106 and disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption(s) under which each deletion is made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption. The location of the information deleted and the exemption(s) under which the deletion is made will be indicated directly on the record itself, if technically feasible.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Adverse determination of requests.</E> If a determination is made to deny a request in any respect, HUD shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include: A determination to withhold any requested record, in whole or in part; a determination <PRTPAGE P="189"/>that a requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has not been retained; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver or reduction; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The denial letter shall be signed by the Director of the Office of the Executive Secretariat, or a designee of the Director, in HUD Headquarters or the FOIA Public Liaison for the HUD field office where the adverse determination was made, and shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(ii) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by HUD in denying the request;</P>
            <P>(iii) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, when appropriate, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the head of the agency, within a period determined by the head of the agency that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination;</P>
            <P>(v) Notice of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison of the agency or the Office of Government Information Services;</P>
            <P>(vi) A statement that the denial may be appealed as provided by § 15.109 and a description of the requirements for appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> HUD will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section. HUD shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a requester. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, HUD may contact a requester for additional information. Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made payable to the United States Treasury.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Commercial use</E> means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. HUD shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because HUD has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, HUD shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Direct costs</E> means those expenses that HUD actually incurs in searching for and duplicating and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as for mainframe computer run time. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting a facility.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Duplication</E> means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> diskette), among others. HUD shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Educational institution</E> means:</P>
            <P>(i)(A) A preschool;<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) A public or private elementary or secondary school;</P>
            <P>(C) An institution of graduate higher education;</P>
            <P>(D) An institution of undergraduate higher education;</P>
            <P>(E) An institution of professional education; or</P>
            <P>(F) An institution of vocational education, that primarily (or solely) operates a program or programs of scholarly research.</P>
            <P>(ii) To be in this category, a requester should show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research. Records requested for the intention of fulfilling credit requirements are not considered to be sought for a scholarly purpose.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Other requester</E> means any requester that does not fall within the categories of requesters described in this section.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Noncommercial scientific institution</E> means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester should show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Representative of the news media,</E> or <E T="03">news media requester,</E> means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term <E T="03">news</E> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available to the general public through a variety of means. For freelance journalists to be regarded as working for a news media entity, they should demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but HUD will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category a requester should not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Fees</E>—(1) <E T="03">Schedule.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, HUD will use the fee schedule set out in the following table, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) Search fees will be charged for all requests other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. HUD may charge for time spent searching even if HUD does not locate any responsive record or if HUD withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be $13 per quarter hour for professional personnel and $6 per quarter hour for clerical personnel.</P>
            <P>(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to locate the requested records.</P>
            <P>(iv) For requests requiring the retrieval of records from any Federal records center, certain additional costs may be incurred in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by the National Archives and Records Administration.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee will be $0.10 per page. For copies in digital format, HUD will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, HUD will charge the direct costs.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Review.</E> Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review (the review done where HUD determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion, at the initial request level). No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies. The cost of that review is chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances. Fees for the review time will be $13 per quarter hour for professional personnel and $6 per quarter hour for clerical personnel.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. In addition, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(5), (d)(6), and (d)(7) of this section, HUD shall not assess any search fees (or, for requesters that are educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees) if HUD has failed to comply with any time limit described in § 15.103.</P>
            <P>(2) Search and review fees will be charged in quarter-hour increments. HUD will round up a quarter hour when professional and clerical search and review time exceeds a quarter-hour increment.</P>
            <P>(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, HUD will provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The first 2 hours of search (or the cost equivalent).</P>
            <P>(4) No fee will be charged whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is less than HUD's cost to process the payment. Currently, whenever a total fee calculated is $25 or less, no fee will be charged.</P>

            <P>(5) If HUD determines that unusual circumstances apply and HUD provides timely written notice to the requester pursuant to requirements provided in § 15.103(c), a failure to comply with any time limit as described in § 15.103 is excused for an additional 10 days. If HUD fails to comply with the extended time limit, HUD may not assess any search fees (or for requesters that are educational or noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the <PRTPAGE P="192"/>news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees).</P>
            <P>(6) If unusual circumstances apply and more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, HUD may charge search fees or, for requesters that are educational or noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees, if timely written notice has been made to the requester pursuant to requirements provided in § 15.103(c) and HUD has discussed with the requester through written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request as stipulated in § 15.103(c).</P>
            <P>(7)(i) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with any time limit as described in § 15.103 shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, the term “exceptional circumstances” does not include a delay that results from a predictable workload of requests, unless HUD demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests. However, refusal by the requester to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request (or a modified request) after HUD gives them an opportunity to do so shall be considered a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.</E> When HUD determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will amount to more than $25, HUD will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as the amount anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be readily estimated, HUD shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25, the request will be held in abeyance for 15 working days. Further work will not be done on that request until the requester has either made a firm commitment to pay the anticipated total fee, or has made payment in advance if the total fee exceeds $250. Any such agreement should be memorialized by the requester in writing, should indicate a given dollar amount, and should be received by HUD within the time period specified by HUD in its notice to the requester. If the requester does not provide a firm commitment to pay the anticipated fee within the time period specified by HUD, the request will be closed. A notice under this paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter of fees with HUD personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. HUD is not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Although not required to provide special services, if HUD chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, HUD will charge the direct costs of providing these services. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending documents by means other than ordinary mail.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> HUD may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by HUD. HUD will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> If HUD reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, HUD may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. HUD may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to <PRTPAGE P="193"/>avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, HUD will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated. Aggregation of requests for fee purposes under this paragraph will be conducted independent of aggregation of requests under § 15.103(d).</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, HUD will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed, such as prepayment before copies are sent to a requester, is not an advance payment.</P>
            <P>(2) If HUD determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester who has a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(3) If a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to HUD within 30 days of the date of billing, before HUD begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester, HUD will require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee. If HUD has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, HUD may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>
            <P>(4) When HUD requires advance payment, the request will be held in abeyance for 15 working days to allow the requester an opportunity to make payment in advance and/or modify the scope of the request. If the requester does not pay the advance payment or modify the scope of the request within the allotted time frame, the request will be closed.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule in this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. Where records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based fee schedule programs, HUD will inform requesters of the contact information for that source.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section if HUD determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, HUD will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) The subject of the requested records should concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(ii) The disclosable portions of the requested records should be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities and “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such increased understanding, where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>

            <P>(iii) The disclosure should contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject <PRTPAGE P="194"/>area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
            <P>(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, should be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, HUD will not make value judgments about whether information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.</P>
            <P>(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, HUD will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) HUD will identify any commercial interest of the requester as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(ii) A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. HUD ordinarily will presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each request. In deciding to grant waivers or reductions of fees, HUD will exercise its discretion to consider the cost effectiveness of its investment of administrative resources.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Documents generally protected from disclosure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) HUD shall withhold information only if HUD reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or disclosure is prohibited by law. HUD will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever HUD determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this section requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law, or otherwise exempted from disclosure as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) The FOIA contains nine exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorize agencies to withhold various records from disclosure. With regard to certain types of records, HUD generally applies the exemptions as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Classified documents.</E> Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. HUD seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, HUD will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. HUD may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Internal agency rules and practices.</E> Exemption 2 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)) protects records relating to internal personnel rules and practices.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Information prohibited from disclosure by another statute.</E> Exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)) protects information that is prohibited from disclosure by another Federal law. HUD generally will not disclose competitive proposals prior to contract award, competitive proposals that are not set forth or incorporated by reference into the awarded contract (see 41 U.S.C. 4702), or, during the selection process, any covered selection information regarding such selection, either directly or indirectly (see 42 U.S.C. 3537a).<PRTPAGE P="195"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Commercial or financial information.</E> Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. HUD will handle this type of information as provided by § 15.108.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Certain interagency or intra-agency communications.</E> Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) protects interagency or intra-agency communications that are protected by legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, or communications reflecting the agency's deliberative process. The deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Personal privacy.</E> Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) protects information involving matters of personal privacy. This information may include personnel, medical, and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of persons residing in public or assisted housing or of borrowers in FHA-insured single family mortgage transactions generally will not be disclosed.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Law enforcement records.</E> Exemption 7 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)) protects certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption protects records where the production could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; for example, the names of individuals who have filed fair housing complaints. The protection of this exemption also encompasses, but is not limited to, information in law enforcement files that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; the names of confidential informants, and techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations, or guidelines for law enforcement investigations if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Supervision of financial institutions.</E> Exemption 8 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)) protects information relating to the supervision of financial institutions. For purposes of Exemption 8, HUD is an “agency responsible for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions” for purposes of monitoring fair housing compliance.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Wells.</E> Exemption 9 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)) protects geological information on wells.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Business information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Business information obtained by HUD from a submitter will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section. In making final confidentiality determinations under this section, HUD relies to a large extent upon the information furnished by the affected business to substantiate its claim of confidentiality. HUD may be unable to verify the accuracy of much of the information submitted by the affected business. HUD will comply with Executive Order 12600 and follow the procedure in this section by giving notice to the affected business and an opportunity for the business to present evidence of its confidentiality claim. If HUD is sued by a requester under the FOIA for nondisclosure of confidential business information, HUD expects the affected business to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in defending such a decision.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of business information.</E> A submitter of business information will use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice to submitters.</E> HUD will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks business information, wherever required under paragraph (d) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph (e) of this section. The notice will either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of <PRTPAGE P="196"/>records containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Where notice is required.</E> Notice will be given to a submitter wherever:</P>
            <P>(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(2) HUD has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> HUD will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, the submitter should submit a detailed written statement specifying the grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, the submitter should show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. HUD generally will not consider conclusory statements that particular information would be useful to competitors or would impair sales, or other similar statements, sufficient to justify confidential treatment. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not received until after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered by HUD. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> HUD will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever HUD decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, HUD will give the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and</P>
            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Exceptions to notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section will not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) HUD determines that the information should not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; or</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of a FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, HUD will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Corresponding notice to requesters.</E> Whenever HUD provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, HUD will notify the requester(s).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A requester may appeal an adverse determination denying a request, in any respect, in writing. The letter of appeal should clearly identify the determination that is being appealed and the assigned tracking number. The appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” for the quickest possible handling. If mailed, the requester's letter of appeal must be postmarked within 90 calendar days of the date of HUD's letter of determination. If the letter of appeal is transmitted electronically or by a means other than the United States Postal Service, it must be received in the appropriate office by the close of business on the 30th calendar day after the date of HUD's letter of determination.<PRTPAGE P="197"/>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">All other appeals.</E> HUD will make a determination on appeals within 20 working days of receipt, unless unusual circumstances require HUD to extend the time for an additional 10 working days.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> An appeal ordinarily will not be acted upon if the subject of the appeal is simultaneously being litigated in an applicable Federal court.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Content of appeals.</E> An appeal letter should include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A copy of the original request;</P>
            <P>(2) A copy of the adverse determination;</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of facts and legal arguments supporting the appeal; and</P>

            <P>(a) The Authorized Approving Official shall determine what material is to be produced or what testimony is to be provided, based upon the following standards:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Expert or opinion material or testimony.</E> In any legal proceeding among private litigants, no employee of the Department may produce material or provide testimony as described in § 15.201(a) that is of an expert or opinion nature, unless specifically authorized by the Authorized Approving Official for good cause shown.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Factual material or testimony.</E> In any legal proceeding among private litigants, no employee of the Department may produce material or provide testimony as described in § 15.201(a) that is of a factual nature, unless specifically authorized by the Authorized Approving Official. The Authorized Approving Official shall determine whether any of the following factors are applicable. Such a demand may either be denied, or conditionally granted in accordance with § 15.204(c), if any such factors are applicable:</P>
            <P>(i) Producing such material or providing such testimony would violate a statute or regulation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Producing such material or providing such testimony would reveal classified, confidential, or privileged material;</P>
            <P>(iii) Such material or testimony would be irrelevant to the legal proceeding;</P>
            <P>(iv) Such material or testimony could be obtained from any other source;</P>
            <P>(v) One or more documents, or a declaration or affidavit, could reasonably be provided in lieu of oral testimony;</P>
            <P>(vi) The amount of employees' time necessary to comply with the demand would be unreasonable;</P>
            <P>(vii) Production of the material or provision of the testimony would not be required under the rules of procedure governing the legal proceeding for which it is sought (e.g., unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the relevant rules governing discovery);</P>
            <P>(viii) Producing such material or providing such testimony would impede a significant interest of the United States; or</P>
            <P>(ix) The Department has any other legally cognizable objection to the release of such information or testimony in response to a demand.</P>
            <P>(b) Once a determination has been made, the requester will be notified of the determination. If the demand is denied, the requestor shall be notified of the reasons for the denial. If the demand is conditionally approved, the requestor shall be notified of the conditions that have been imposed upon the production of the material or provision of the testimony demanded, and the reasons for the conditional approval of the demand.</P>
            <P>(c) The Authorized Approving Official may impose conditions or restrictions on the production of any material or provision of any testimony. Such conditions or restrictions may include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A requirement that the parties to the legal proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access to, and limit any further disclosure of, material or testimony;</P>
            <P>(2) A requirement that the requester accept examination of documentary material on HUD premises in lieu of production of copies;</P>
            <P>(3) A limitation on the subject areas of testimony permitted;</P>
            <P>(4) A requirement that testimony of a HUD employee be provided by deposition at a location prescribed by HUD or by written declaration;</P>
            <P>(5) A requirement that the parties to the legal proceeding agree that a transcript of the permitted testimony be kept under seal or will only be used or only made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was demanded;</P>

            <P>(6) A requirement that the requester purchase an extra copy of the transcript of the employee's testimony from the court reporter and provide the Department with a copy at the requester's expense; or<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
            </P>
            <P>(7) Any other condition or restriction deemed to be in the best interests of the United States, including reimbursement of costs to the Department.</P>
            <P>(d) The determination made with respect to the production of material or provision of testimony pursuant to this subpart is within the sole discretion of the Authorized Approving Official and shall constitute final agency action from which no administrative appeal is available.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and statement of policy.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The purpose of this part is to establish policies and procedures for implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), 5 U.S.C. 552(a). The main objectives are to facilitate full <PRTPAGE P="202"/>exercise of rights conferred on individuals under the Act and to insure the protection of privacy as to individuals about whom the Department maintains records in systems of records under the Act. The Department accepts the responsibility to act promptly and in accordance with the Act upon receipt of any inquiry, request or appeal from a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States, regardless of the age of the individual.</P>
          <P>(b) Further, the Department accepts the obligations to maintain only such information on individuals as is relevant and necessary to the performance of its lawful functions, to maintain that information with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness in determinations made by the Department about the individual, to obtain information from the individual to the extent practicable, and to take every reasonable step to protect that information from unwarranted disclosure. The Department will maintain no record describing how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.</P>
          <P>(c) This part applies to all organizational components in the Department in order to assure the maximum amount of uniformity and consistency within the Department in its implementation of the Act.</P>
          <P>(d) The Assistant Secretary for Administration shall be responsible for carrying out the requirements of this part, for issuing such orders and directives internal to the Department as are necessary for full compliance with the Act, and for effecting publication of all required notices concerning systems of records.</P>

          <P>(e) Requests involving information pertaining to an individual which is in a record or file but not within the scope of a System of Records Notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> are outside the scope of this part. Requests for departmental records will be considered to determine whether processing under this part, part 15, or both is most appropriate, notwithstanding the requester's characterization of the request, as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about that individual and not contained in a Privacy Act Records System</E> shall be considered a Freedom of Information Act request and processed under HUD Freedom of Information Act regulations (24 CFR part 15) to the extent that the requester has provided the Department a reasonable description of the documents requested. When a request for records is so considered as a Freedom of Information Act request, the Privacy Act Officer shall promptly refer it to the head of the appropriate organizational unit in accordance with HUD FOIA Regulations and shall advise the requester that time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by the appropriate official.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for records about that individual contained in a Privacy Act Records System</E> shall be processed as follows:</P>
          <P>(i) If the request in whole or in part contains a reasonable description of any HUD document, processing shall be carried out pursuant to HUD FOIA Regulations.</P>

          <P>(ii) If the request in whole or in part does not contain a reasonable description of any HUD document, but does provide sufficient information under HUD Privacy Act Regulations to undertake a Privacy Act Records System search, the Department will provide full access under HUD Privacy Act Regulations. In this situation, the Department will comply with the deadlines for response set forth in the Privacy Act and HUD implementing regulations. In that event, an explanation will be provided to the requester advising that the request did not contain a reasonable description of a particular document as required under the FOIA and offering to process the request under FOIA procedures upon receipt of additional information sufficient to constitute a <E T="03">reasonable description.</E>
          </P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for records about another individual contained in a Privacy <PRTPAGE P="203"/>Act Records System</E> shall be processed as follows: When an exemption under subsection (b) of FOIA is available, the Privacy Act governs the public interest determination under HUD FOIA Regulations (24 CFR 15.21) and compels the withholding of such documents unless: (i) The subject of those records consents to their release or (ii) disclosure comes within one of the subsections of 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b).</P>
          <P>(4) <E T="03">A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about another individual</E> shall be processed as follows: Except as expressly permitted in this part, requests by persons who are not the subject of a record contained in a Privacy Act Records System shall be outside the scope of this part. If the request satisfies the Freedom of Information Act requirement that requested records be reasonably described, the Privacy Act Officer shall consider the requests as a Freedom of Information Act request and shall proceed as in § 16.1(e)(1) of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Requests for access; requirements.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Any individual, regardless of age, may submit to the Department a request for access to records of the Department. The request should be made either in person at the Office of, or by mail addressed to, the responsible Privacy Act Officer. Although oral requests may be honored, a requester may be asked to submit his request in writing. The envelope containing the request and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is a PRIVACY ACT REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO RECORDS.</P>
          <P>(b) When a request for access to records is misdirected by the requester, or not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department official receiving same shall promptly refer it to the appropriate Privacy Act Officer and the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by that official.</P>

          <P>(c) When a request for access to records fails to provide necessary information as set forth in paragraph (b) of <PRTPAGE P="205"/>this section the requester shall be advised that the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when the additional necessary information is received by the appropriate official.</P>
          <P>(d) The requirements for identification of individuals seeking access to records are as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">In person.</E> Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:</P>
          <P>(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, passport or military or civilian identification card);</P>
          <P>(ii) A document bearing the individual's signature (for example, driver's license, social security card, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card and professional, craft or union membership card); and</P>
          <P>(iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of the individual (for example, a Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Department will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3). That penalty provision also appears at § 16.13(a). In order to avoid any unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, the Department reserves the right to determine to its satisfaction whether proof of identity offered by any individual is adequate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Not in person.</E> If the individual making a request does not appear in person before a Privacy Act Officer, the information set forth in § 16.3(b)(1) and a certificate of a notary public or equivalent officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request. The certificate within or attached to the letter must be substantially in accord with the following text:

          <FP>If the request follows inquiry under § 16.3, this should be indicated in the request for access in order to facilitate processing.</FP>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Parents of minors and legal guardians.</E> An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the same manner prescribed in either paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section. In addition, such other individual shall establish his or her representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the provisions of § 16.5(e) are satisfied.</P>
          <P>(e) When the provisions of this part are alleged to have the effect of impeding an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Department will consider alternative suggestions from an individual making a request, regarding proof of identity and access to records.</P>

If a response cannot be made within ten days due to unusual circumstances, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgement during that period providing information on the status of the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request. <E T="03">Unusual circumstances</E> shall include circumstances where a search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Grant of access</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notification.</E> An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to him or her, except where the provisions of § 16.6 apply. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information:</P>
          <P>(i) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</P>
          <P>(ii) The place at which the record may be inspected;</P>
          <P>(iii) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the period of time that the records will remain available for inspection and/or the estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees pursuant to § 16.12;</P>
          <P>(iv) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be accompanied by another individual during personal access, subject to procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section; and</P>
          <P>(v) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific record.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Methods of access.</E> The following methods of access to records by an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given situation:</P>
          <P>(i) Inspection in person may be had in the office specified by the Privacy Act Officer granting access during hours indicated by the Privacy Act Officer;</P>
          <P>(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at the facility, and that transmittal of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the Department or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and manpower; and</P>
          <P>(iii) Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 16.12. The Department, at its own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee will be charged the individual.</P>
          <P>(c) The Department shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of access as to make the record intelligible to the individual.</P>
          <P>(d) The Department reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as tape or disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no event shall original records of the Department be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his designee. It is a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy any record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing, Title 18, United States Code, 2701(a).</P>

          <P>(e) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice. <E T="03">Accompanied</E> includes discussion of the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual by a signed and dated document which includes the name of the other individual and specifically describes the record to which access is sought. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the Privacy Act Officer. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by <PRTPAGE P="207"/>another individual during personal access to a record.</P>

          <P>(a)(1) Not later than ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after receipt of a request to correct or amend a record, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgment providing an estimate of time within which action will be taken on the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request. The estimate of time may take into account unusual circumstances as described in § 16.5(a). No acknowledgment will be sent if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of the results of review (either compliance or denial) within the ten days. Requests filed in person will be acknowledged at the time submitted.</P>
          <P>(2) Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, or after receiving such further information as might have been requested, or after arriving at a decision within the time prescribed in § 16.9(a)(1), the Privacy Act Officer shall either:</P>
          <P>(i) Make the requested correction or amendment and advise the individual in writing of such action, providing either a copy of the corrected or amended record or a statement as to the means whereby the correction or amendment was effected in cases where a copy cannot be provided; or,</P>
          <P>(ii) Inform the individual in writing that his or her request is denied and provide the following information:</P>

          <P>(A) The Privacy Act Officer's name and title and position;<PRTPAGE P="209"/>
          </P>

          <P>(D) The procedures for appeal of the denial as set forth in § 16.10, including the name and address of the Privacy Appeals Officer. The term <E T="03">promptly</E> in this § 16.9 means within thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). If the Privacy Act Officer cannot make the determination within thirty days, the individual will be advised in writing of the reason therefor and of the estimated date by which the determination will be made.</P>
          <P>(b) Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant to a request by that individual, the Privacy Act Officer shall see to the notification of all persons and agencies to which the corrected or amended portion of the record had been disclosed prior to its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure was made as required by the Act. The notification shall require a recipient agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or amend the record and to appraise any agency or person to which it had disclosed the record of the substance of the correction or amendment.</P>
          <P>(c) The following criteria will be considered by the Privacy Act Officer in reviewing a request for correction or amendment:</P>
          <P>(1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;</P>

          <P>(3) The relevance and necessity of the information in terms of the purpose for which it was collected;</P>
          <P>(4) The timeliness and currency of the information in terms of the purpose for which it was collected:</P>
          <P>(5) The completeness of the information in terms of the purpose for which it was collected:</P>
          <P>(6) The possibility that denial of the request could unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;</P>
          <P>(7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; and</P>
          <P>(8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific means of correction or amendment requested by the individual.</P>
          <P>(d) The Department will not undertake to gather evidence for the individual, but does reserve the right to verify the evidence which the individual submits.</P>
          <P>(e) Correction or amendment of a record requested by an individual will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Appeal of initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Appeal shall be available only from a written denial of a request for correction or amendment of a record issued under § 16.9, and only if a written appeal is filed within thirty calendar days after the issuance of the written denial.</P>
          <P>(b) Each appeal shall be addressed to the Privacy Appeals Officer identified in the written denial. The envelope containing the appeal and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is PRIVACY ACT APPEAL.</P>

          <P>(c) When an appeal is misdirected by the requester, or not addressed as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="210"/>the Department official receiving same shall promptly refer it to the appropriate Privacy Appeals Officer and the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by the appropriate official.</P>

The appeal shall be signed by the individual. The record which the individual requests be corrected or amended will be supplied by the Privacy Act Officer who issued the initial denial. While the foregoing normally will comprise the entire record on appeal, the Privacy Appeals Officer may seek additional information necessary to assure that the final determination is fair and equitable and, in such instances, the additional information will be disclosed to the individual to the greatest extent possible and an opportunity provided for comment thereon.</P>
          <P>(f) No hearing on appeal will be allowed.</P>
          <P>(g) The Privacy Appeals Officer shall act upon the appeal and issue a final Department determination in writing not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date on which the appeal is received; provided, that the Privacy Appeals Officer may extend the thirty days upon deciding that a fair and equitable review cannot be made within that period, but only if the individual is advised in writing of the reason for the extension and the estimated date by which a final determination will issue (which estimated date should not be later than the sixtieth day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after receipt of the appeal unless unusual circumstances, as described in § 16.5(a), are met).</P>
          <P>(h) If the appeal is determined in favor of the individual, the final determination shall include the specific corrections or amendments to be made and a copy thereof shall be transmitted promptly both to the individual and to the Privacy Act Officer who issued the initial denial.

          <P>(1) The right of the individual to file a concise statement of reasons for disagreeing with the final determination. The statement ordinarily should not exceed one page and the Department reserves the right to reject a statement of excessive length. Such a statement shall be filed with the Privacy Appeals Officer. It should identify the date of the final determination and be signed by the individual. The Privacy Appeals Officer shall acknowledge receipt of such statement and inform the individual of the date on which it was received;</P>
          <P>(2) The fact that any such disagreement statement filed by the individual will be noted in the disputed record and that a copy of the statement will be provided to persons and agencies to which the record is disclosed subsequent to the date of receipt of such statement;</P>
          <P>(3) The fact that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of the dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures, as required by the Act, was made;</P>
          <P>(4) The fact that the Department will append to any such disagreement statement filed by the individual, a copy of the final determination or summary thereof which also will be provided to persons and agencies to which the disagreement statement is disclosed; and,</P>

          <P>(5) The right of the individual to judicial review of the final determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).<PRTPAGE P="211"/>
          </P>
          <P>(j) In making the final determination, the Privacy Appeals Officer shall employ the criteria set forth in paragraph 16.9(c) and shall deny an appeal only on the grounds set forth in § 16.9(e).</P>
          <P>(k) If an appeal is partially granted and partially denied, the Privacy Appeals Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.</P>
          <P>(l) Although a copy of the final determination or a summary thereof will be treated as part of the individual's record for purposes of disclosure in instances where the individual has filed a disagreement statement, it will not be subject to correction or amendment by the individual.</P>

            <P>(6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;</P>
            <P>(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;</P>

          <P>(a) The only fees to be charged to or collected from an individual under the provisions of this part are for copying records at the request of the individual.</P>
          <P>(1) No fees shall be charged or collected for the following: Search for and retrieval of the records; review of the records; copying at the initiative of the Department without a request from the individual; transportation of records and personnel; and first class postage.</P>
          <P>(2) It is the policy of the Department to provide an individual with one copy of each record corrected or amended pursuant to his or her request without charge as evidence of the correction or amendment.</P>
          <P>(3) As requested by the United States Civil Service Commission in its published regulations implementing the Act, the Department will charge no fee to an individual who requests copies of a personnel record covered by that Commission's Government-wide published notice of systems of records. However, when such records are voluminous and the cost of copying would be in excess of five dollars ($5) the Department may, in its discretion, charge a fee.</P>

          <P>(b) The copying fees prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section are:

A copying fee shall not be charged or collected, or alternatively, it may be reduced when such action is determined by the Privacy Act Officer to be in the public interest.</P>
          <P>(e) Special and additional services provided at the request of the individual, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to the individual in accordance with other published regulations of the Department pursuant to statute (for example, 31 U.S.C. 433a).</P>

          <SUBJECT>General exemptions.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by the Department but which were provided by another agency which has determined by regulation that such information is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records <PRTPAGE P="213"/>are within a request for access, the Department will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.</P>
          <P>(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has determined that the Office of the Assistant Inspector General for Investigation performs, as its principal function, activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The records maintained by that office in a system identified as “HUD/DEPT-24, Investigation Files,” primarily consist of information compiled for the purpose of criminal investigations and are associated with identifiable individuals. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this system of records shall be exempt, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from all requirements of the Privacy Act except 5 U.S.C. 552a (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) unless elsewhere exempted.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 16.15</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Specific exemptions.</SUBJECT>

          <P>Whenever the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines it to be necessary and proper, with respect to any system of records maintained by the Department, to exercise the right to promulgate rules to exempt such systems in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), each specific exemption, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for each exemption shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</P>

          <P>(a) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), (I), and (f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled for law enforcement purposes. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to prevent individuals, who are the subjects of investigation, from frustrating the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</P>
          <P>(1) HUD/DEPT-15. Equal Opportunity Housing Complaints.</P>
          <P>(2) HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.</P>
          <P>(3) HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.</P>

          <P>(b) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(5) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I), and (f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal contracts, or access to classified material. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to insure the proper functioning of the investigatory process, to insure effective determination of suitability, eligibility and qualification for employment and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.</P>
          <P>(1) HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.</P>
          <P>(2) HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.</P>
          <P>(c) The system of records entitled “HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files” consists in part of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal, state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore, to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.</P>

          <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and <PRTPAGE P="214"/>could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.</P>
          <P>(2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
          <P>(3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.</P>
          <P>(4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.</P>
          <P>(d) The system of records entitled “HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files” consists in part of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.</P>
          <P>(1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.</P>

              <P>(a) For purposes of this subpart, a claim shall be deemed to have been presented when the Department receives, at a place designated in paragraph (b) of this section, an executed <E T="03">Claim for Damages or Injury,</E> Standard Form 95, or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to or loss of property, for personal injury, or for death alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident. A claim which should have been presented to the Department, but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is deemed to be presented to the Department as of the date that the claim is received by the Department. If a claim <PRTPAGE P="216"/>is mistakenly addressed to or filed with the Department, the Department shall forthwith transfer it to the appropriate Federal agency, if ascertainable, or return it to the claimant.</P>
              <P>(b) A claimant shall mail or deliver his claim to the office of employment of the Department employee or employees whose negligent or wrongful act or omission is alleged to have caused the loss or injury complained of. Where such office of employment is the Department Central Office in Washington, or is not reasonably known and not reasonably ascertainable, claimant shall file his claim with the Assistant Secretary for Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. In all other cases, claimant shall address his claim to the head of the appropriate office, the address of which will generally be found listed in the local telephone directory.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This subpart applies to all claims filed by or on behalf of employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for loss of or damage to personal property which occurs incident to their service with HUD under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964. A claim must be substantiated and the possession of the property determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. The maximum amount that can be paid under any claim under the Act is $25,000 and property may be replaced in kind at the option of the Government. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to bar claims payable under statutory authority.</P>
            <P>(b) HUD is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from HUD. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for his loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of his claim under this subpart.</P>

            <P>(a) A claim may be allowed only if:</P>
            <P>(1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his agent, the members of his family, or his private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and</P>
            <P>(2) The possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and</P>
            <P>(3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.</P>
            <P>(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this part shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.</P>

            <P>(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with HUD may <PRTPAGE P="220"/>be considered and allowed.

            <P>(3) <E T="03">Manufactured homes.</E> Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, manufactured homes and their contents under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Claims for structural damage to manufactured homes, other than that caused by collision, and damage to contents of manufactured homes resulting from such structural damage, must contain conclusive evidence that the damage was not caused by structural deficiency of the manufactured home and that it was not overloaded. Claims for damage to, or loss of, tires mounted on manufactured homes will not be allowed, except in cases of collision, theft, or vandalism.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Enemy action or public service.</E> Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, property as a direct consequence of:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Claims involving carriers or insurers.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In the event the property which is the subject of a claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:</P>
            <P>(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost, or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.</P>
            <P>(1) If more than one bill of lading or contract was issued, a separate demand should be made against the last carrier on each such document.</P>
            <P>(2) The demand should be made within 9 months of the date that delivery was made, or within 9 months of the date that delivery should ordinarily have been made.</P>
            <P>(3) If it is apparent that the damage or loss is attributable to packing, storage, or unpacking while in the custody of the Government, no demand need be made against the carrier.</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever property which is damaged, lost, or destroyed incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the concurrent claim against the Government.</P>

            <P>(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer, had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.<PRTPAGE P="222"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit his claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of his claim is made by the carrier or insurer.</P>
            <P>(1) Upon submitting his claim, he will certify in his claim that he has or has not gained any recovery from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.</P>
            <P>(2) If final action has not been taken by the carrier or insurer on his claim, he will immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to his claim to him, in care of the General Counsel of HUD.</P>
            <P>(3) The claimant shall advise the General Counsel of any action taken by the carrier or insurer on his claim and upon request shall furnish all correspondence documents, and other evidence pertinent to the matter.</P>
            <P>(e) The claimant will assign to the United States to the extent of any payment on his claim accepted by him, all his right, title and interest in any claim he may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. After payment of his claim by the United States, the claimant will, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by him from the United States.</P>
            <P>(f) Where a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before his claim under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to his claim as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this part, no compensation is allowable under this part.</P>
            <P>(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of such total loss.</P>
            <P>(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f) the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the $6,500 maximum set forth above. However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds $6,500, the claimant will be allowed only $6,500.</P>

            <P>(b) The General Counsel may formulate such procedures and make such redelegations as may be required to fulfill the objectives of this subpart.</P>

            <P>(d) The General Counsel shall notify a claimant in writing of action taken on his claim, and if partial or full disallowance is made, the reasons therefor.</P>
            <P>(e) In the event a claim submitted against a carrier under § 17.46 has not been settled before settlement of the claim against the Government pursuant to this subpart, the General Counsel shall notify such carrier or insurer to pay the proceeds of the claim to HUD to the extent HUD has paid such to claimant in settlement.</P>

            <P>(2) The reasonable cost of repairs, when property is economically repairable, provided that the cost of repairs does not exceed the amount allowable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="223"/>
            </P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notification by the debtor.</E> A debtor who receives notice of intent to offset pursuant to § 17.65 has the right to a review of the case and to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable. The debtor may send a copy of the notice with a letter notifying the Office of Appeals of his or her intention to present evidence.

The decision of an administrative judge of the OA will be based on a preponderance of the evidence as to whether there is a debt that is past due and whether it is legally enforceable.

              <SUBJECT>Scope and definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The provisions set forth in §§ 17.83 through 17.113 are the Department's procedures for the collection of delinquent nontax debts by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain debts owed the government, including centralized salary offsets in accordance with 31 CFR part 285.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) This section and §§ 17.85 through 17.99 apply to collections by the Secretary through salary offset from current employees of the Department and other agencies who owe debts to the Department; and</P>
              <P>(2) This section, § 17.85, and §§ 17.101 through 17.113 apply to HUD's offset of pay to current employees of the Department and of other agencies who owe debts to HUD or other agencies under noncentralized salary offset procedures, in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1109.</P>
              <P>(c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1-9602), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301-1397f), the tariff laws of the United States, or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.</P>
              <P>(d) These regulations identify the types of salary offset available to the Department, as well as certain rights provided to the employee, which include a written notice before deductions begin, the opportunity to petition for a hearing, receiving a written decision if a hearing is granted, and the opportunity to propose a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. These employee rights do not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.</P>
              <P>(e) Nothing in these regulations precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the Department's regulations contained elsewhere in this subpart (see 24 CFR 17.61 through 17.79).</P>
              <P>(f) As used in the salary offset provisions at §§ 17.83 through 17.113:</P>

In making this determination, the Secretary will balance the Department's interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, the Secretary will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A debt will be collected by deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Secretary agree to alternative arrangements for repayment. The alternative arrangement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Installment deductions.</E> Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in 3 years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sources of deductions.</E> The Department will make deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 18.1</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Department of Housing and Urban Development may indemnify, in whole or in part, a Department employee (which for the purpose of this part includes a former Department employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any such employee, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:</P>
          <P>(1) The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Department; and</P>
          <P>(2) Such indemnification is in the interest of the United States.</P>
          <P>(b) The Department of Housing and Urban Development may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against a Department employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:</P>
          <P>(1) The alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment; and</P>
          <P>(2) That such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the United States.</P>
          <P>(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.</P>

          <P>(d) When an employee of the Department becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly notify the head of his or her operating component and the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement, if the supervisor is located at headquarters, or Field Assistant General Counsel—who shall promptly notify the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement—if the supervisor is located in the field. As used in this section, the term “principal operating component” means an office in the Department headed by an Assistant Secretary, the General Counsel, the Inspector General, or an equivalent departmental officer who reports directly to the Secretary. Questions regarding representation of the employee will be determined by the Department of Justice pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15 (Representation of Federal officials and employees by Department of Justice attorneys or by private counsel furnished by the Department in civil, criminal, and congressional proceedings in which Federal employees are sued, subpoenaed, or charged in their individual capacities).<PRTPAGE P="232"/>
          </P>
          <P>(e) The employee may, thereafter, request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or monetary award entered against the employee or to compromise a claim pending against the employee. The employee shall submit a written request, with appropriate documentation including a copy of the verdict, judgment, award or other order or settlement proposal, in a timely manner to the head of the employee's principal operating component. The head of the employee's principal operating component shall submit the written request and accompanying documentation, together with a recommended disposition of the request, in a timely manner to the General Counsel.</P>
          <P>(f) The General Counsel shall seek the views of the Department of Justice on the request. Where the Department of Justice has rendered a decision denying representation of the employee pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15, the General Counsel shall seek the concurrence of the Department of Justice on the request. If the Department of Justice does not concur in the request, the General Counsel shall so advise the employee and no further action on the employee's request shall be taken.</P>
          <P>(g) In all instances except those where the Department of Justice has non-concurred in the request, the General Counsel shall forward for decision to the Secretary or his or her designee the employee's request, the recommendation of the head of the employee's principal operating component, the views of the Department of Justice, and the General Counsel's recommendation.</P>
          <P>(h) Any payment under this part, either to indemnify a Department employee or to settle a personal damage claim, is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Department that are permitted by law to be utilized for this purpose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Discovery.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures, which may commence at any time after an answer has been filed. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the hearing officer may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter involved in the action. To be relevant, information need not be admissible at the hearing, if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with discovery. Discovery may include:</P>
              <P>(1) Requests for production of documents as set forth in § 26.19;</P>
              <P>(2) Depositions as set forth in § 26.20;</P>
              <P>(3) Written interrogatories as set forth in § 26.21; and</P>
              <P>(4) Requests for admissions as set forth in § 26.22.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Supplementation of responses.</E> A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response is under a duty to timely amend a prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if so ordered by the hearing officer, or if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requesting an order.</E> In connection with any discovery procedure, by motion addressed to the hearing officer and upon a showing of a good faith attempt to resolve the issue without the hearing officer's intervention, either party may:</P>
              <P>(1) Request an order compelling a response with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the discovery requested or any part thereof, or any failure to respond as specifically requested, or</P>
              <P>(2) Request a protective order limiting the scope, methods, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting privileged information or documents.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> (1) By order, the hearing officer may set or alter limits on the number of document requests, depositions, and interrogatories, or the length of depositions.</P>
              <P>(2) Orders compelling discovery shall be issued only where such discovery will not compel the disclosure of privileged information, unduly delay the hearing, or result in prejudice to the public interest or the rights of the parties, and upon a showing of good cause.</P>
              <P>(3) Protective orders may be issued by a hearing officer if the hearing officer determines such an order is necessary to protect a party or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense because:</P>
              <P>(i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</P>

              <P>(ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in <PRTPAGE P="246"/>the action to obtain the information sought; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.</P>
              <P>(4) A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the hearing officer may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause or, when the party's refusal to provide the information sought is solely due to undue expense, if the party seeking the discovery agrees to bear the expense associated with the request.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Refusal to honor discovery order.</E> When a party refuses to honor a discovery order, the hearing officer may issue such orders in regard to the refusal as justice shall require.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Request for production of documents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request to produce.</E> Any party may serve upon any other party a written request to produce, and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on the requestor's behalf, to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated documents—including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained—translated, if necessary, by the respondent into reasonably usable form, or to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated tangible things that constitute or contain matters within the scope of § 26.18(a) and which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> The request shall set forth, either by individual item or by category, the items to be inspected, and describe each with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. The request may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Response to request to produce.</E> The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 20 days after service of the request. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the hearing officer, or in the absence of such an order, agreed to by the parties in a written document that shall be timely submitted to the hearing officer. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, whether inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested. If there are any objections to any requests, including objections to the requested form or forms for producing electronically stored information, the response shall state the reasons for such objections. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified and inspection of the remaining parts shall be permitted. If objection is made to the requested format or forms for producing electronically stored information—or if no form was specified in the request—the responding party must state the form or forms it intends to use. The party submitting the request may move for an order under § 26.18(c)(1) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of production.</E> Unless the parties otherwise agree, or the hearing officer otherwise orders:</P>
              <P>(1) A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request;</P>

              <P>(2) If a request does not specify the format or forms for producing electronically stored information, a responding party must produce the information in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a form <PRTPAGE P="247"/>or forms that are reasonably usable; and</P>
              <P>(3) A party need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Taking oral deposition.</E> A party may take the oral deposition of any person. Reasonable written notice of deposition shall be served upon the opposing party and the deponent. The attendance of a deponent may be compelled by subpoena where authorized by law or by other order of the hearing officer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Testifying on oral deposition.</E> Each person testifying on oral deposition shall be placed under oath by the person before whom the deposition is taken. The deponent may be examined and cross-examined. The questions and the answers, together with all objections made, shall be recorded by the person before whom the deposition is to be taken, or under that person's direction.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Objections.</E> Objection may be made to questions or answers for any reason that would require the exclusion of the testimony under § 26.24 as if the witness were present and testifying at hearing. Objections shall be in short form, stating every ground for objection. Failure to object to any question or answer shall be considered a waiver of objection, unless the parties agree otherwise. Rulings on any objections shall be made by the hearing officer at hearing, or at such other time requested by motion. The examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections; the deponent may be instructed not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the hearing officer, or to present a motion for a protective order under § 26.18(c)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission to deponent.</E> A transcript of the deposition shall be submitted to the deponent for examination and signature, unless submission is waived by the deponent and the parties. Any changes in form or substance that the deponent desires to make shall be entered upon the transcript by the person before whom the deposition was taken, with a statement of reasons given by the deponent for making them. The transcript shall then be signed by the deponent, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the deponent is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall sign it and state on the record the reason that it is not signed.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Certification and filing.</E> The person before whom the deposition was taken shall make a certification on the transcript as to its accuracy. Interested parties shall make their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and the exhibits.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Deposition as evidence.</E> Subject to appropriate rulings by the hearing officer on objections, the deposition or any part may be introduced into evidence for any purpose if the deponent is unavailable. Only that part of a deposition that is received in evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding upon which a decision may be based. Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the use of a deposition for impeachment purposes.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Service of interrogatories.</E> Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not to exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts, unless additional interrogatories are agreed to by the parties or leave to serve additional interrogatories is granted by the hearing officer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Response to interrogatories.</E> Within 20 days after service of the request, the party upon whom the interrogatories are served shall serve a written response, unless the parties agree in a written document submitted to the hearing officer or the hearing officer determines that a shorter or longer period is appropriate under the circumstances. The response shall specifically answer each interrogatory, separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for any objections with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection <PRTPAGE P="248"/>is waived unless the party's failure to object is excused by the hearing officer for good cause shown. If objection is made to only part of an interrogatory, the objectionable part shall be specified and the party shall answer to the extent that the interrogatory is not objectionable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Option to produce business records.</E> Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records, including electronically stored information, of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract, or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can by the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</P>

              <P>(a) Any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of fact. Copies of documents shall be delivered with the request unless copies have already been furnished. Each requested admission shall be considered admitted, unless within 30 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the parties may agree, or the hearing officer determines, the party from whom the admission is sought serves upon the party making the request either:</P>
              <P>(1) A statement that:</P>
              <P>(i) Denies specifically the relevant matters for which an admission is requested, or sets forth in detail the reasons why the party can neither truthfully admit nor deny them;</P>
              <P>(ii) Fairly meets the substance of the requested admission and, when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, specifies as much of it as is true and qualifies or denies the remainder; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Does not assert lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry, and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny; or</P>
              <P>(2) Written objections to a requested admission that:</P>
              <P>(i) State the grounds for the objection; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Object to a requested admission, if necessary, either in whole or in part, on the basis of privilege or relevance.</P>
              <P>(b) Responses to the request for admission on matters to which objections have been made may be deferred until the objection is ruled upon, but if written objections are made only to a part of a request, a response to the remainder of the request shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(c) Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the hearing officer, on motion, permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Admissions obtained pursuant to this procedure may be used in evidence only for the purposes of the pending action. The use of obtained admissions as evidence is permitted to the same extent and subject to the same objections as other evidence.</P>

Irrelevant, immaterial, privileged, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.

              <SUBJECT>Discovery.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures, which may commence at any time after an answer has been filed. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. For good cause, the ALJ may order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject matter of the action. To be relevant, information need not be admissible at the hearing, if the discovery appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with discovery.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Discovery in Program Fraud Civil Remedies Actions.</E> (1) Upon receipt of a complaint, the defendant may, upon written request to the Office of General Counsel, review any relevant and material nonprivileged documents, including any exculpatory documents, that relate to the allegations set out in the complaint. Exculpatory information that is contained in a privileged document must be disclosed; however, the privileged document need not be provided.</P>
              <P>(2) With the exception of the limited discovery permitted under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless agreed to by the parties, discovery shall be available only as ordered by the ALJ. The ALJ shall order only that discovery that he or she determines is necessary for the expeditious, fair, and reasonable consideration of the issues, is not unduly costly or burdensome, and will not unduly delay the proceeding. Discovery of privileged information shall not be permitted. The request for approval sent to the Attorney General from the General Counsel or designee, as described in 31 U.S.C. § 3803(a)(2), is not discoverable under any circumstances. The ALJ may grant discovery subject to a protective order under § 26.44.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Authorized discovery.</E> The following types of discovery are authorized:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Requests for production of documents.</E> (i) Any party may serve upon any other party a written request to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on the requestor's behalf, to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated documents or electronically stored information—including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained—translated, if necessary, by the respondent into reasonably usable form, or to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated tangible things that constitute or contain matters within the scope of § 26.42(a) and which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served.</P>
              <P>(ii) The request shall set forth, either by individual item or by category, the items to be inspected, and describe each with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. The request may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.</P>

              <P>(iii) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 20 days after the service of the request. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the ALJ or, in the absence of such an order, agreed to in a written document by the parties, which shall be submitted to the ALJ in a timely manner. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, whether inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested. If there are any objections to any requests, including objections to the requested form or forms for producing electronically stored information, the response shall state the reasons for such objections. If objection is made to part of an item or category, <PRTPAGE P="256"/>the part shall be specified and inspection permitted of the remaining parts. If objection is made to the requested format for producing electronically stored information—or if no format was specified in the request—the responding party must state the format it intends to use. The party submitting the request may move for an order under paragraph (e) of this section with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.</P>
              <P>(iv) Unless the parties otherwise agree, or the ALJ otherwise orders:</P>
              <P>(A) A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request;</P>
              <P>(B) If a request does not specify the form or forms for producing electronically stored information, a responding party must produce the information in a format in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a format that is reasonably usable; and</P>
              <P>(C) A party need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Requests for admissions.</E> Any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission of the genuineness of any documents described in the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of fact. Copies of documents shall be delivered with the request unless copies have already been furnished. Each requested admission shall be considered admitted, unless, within 30 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the parties may agree to or the ALJ determines, the party from whom the admission is sought serves upon the party making the request either:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement, which:</P>
              <P>(A) Denies specifically the relevant matters for which an admission is requested, or sets forth in detail the reasons why the party can neither truthfully admit nor deny them;</P>
              <P>(B) Fairly meets the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party specifies as much of it as is true and qualifies or denies the remainder; and</P>
              <P>(C) Does not assert lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry, and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Written objections to a requested admission, which state the grounds for the objection and which object to a requested admission, if necessary, either in whole or in part, on the basis of privilege or relevance. Responses to the request for admission on matters to which objections have been made may be deferred until each objection is ruled upon, but if written objections are made only to a part of a request, a response to the remainder of the request shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the ALJ, on motion, permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Admissions obtained pursuant to this procedure may be used in evidence only for the purposes of the pending action. The use of obtained admissions as evidence is permitted to the same extent and subject to the same objections as other evidence.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Written interrogatories</E>—(i) <E T="03">Service of written interrogatories.</E> Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not exceeding 25 in number, including all discrete subparts, unless additional interrogatories are agreed to by the parties or leave to serve additional interrogatories is granted by the ALJ.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Response to interrogatories.</E> Within 20 days after service of the request, the party upon whom the interrogatories are served shall serve a written response, unless the parties agree in a written document submitted to the ALJ or the ALJ determines that a shorter or longer period is appropriate under the circumstances. The response shall specifically answer each interrogatory separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for objection with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection <PRTPAGE P="257"/>is waived unless the party's failure to object is excused by the ALJ for good cause shown. If objection is made to only part of an interrogatory, the objectionable part shall be specified and the party shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Option to produce business records.</E> Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records, including electronically stored information, of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract, or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Depositions.</E> (i) A party may take the oral deposition of any person. Reasonable written notice of deposition shall be served upon the opposing party and the deponent. The attendance of a deponent may be compelled by subpoena where authorized by law or other order by the ALJ.</P>
              <P>(ii) Each person testifying on oral deposition shall be placed under oath by the person before whom the deposition is taken. The deponent may be examined and cross-examined. The questions and the answers, together with all objections made, shall be recorded by the person before whom the deposition is to be taken or under that person's direction.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Objections.</E> Objection may be made to questions or answers for any reason that would require the exclusion of the testimony under § 26.47 as if the witness were present and testifying at hearing. Objections shall be in short form, stating every ground for objection. Failure to object to any question or answer shall be considered a waiver of objection, unless the parties agree otherwise. Rulings on any objections shall be made by the ALJ at hearing, or at such other time as is requested by motion. The examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections; a person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the ALJ, or to present a motion under § 26.44.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Submission to deponent.</E> A transcript of the deposition shall be submitted to the deponent for examination and signature, unless submission is waived by the deponent and the parties. Any changes in form or substance that the deponent desires to make shall be entered upon the transcript by the person before whom the deposition was taken, with a statement of reasons given by the deponent for making them. The transcript shall then be signed by the deponent, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the deponent is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall sign it and state on the record the reason that it is not signed by the deponent.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Certification and filing.</E> The person before whom the deposition was taken shall make a certification on the transcript as to its accuracy. Interested parties shall make their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and the exhibits.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Deposition as evidence.</E> Subject to appropriate rulings by the ALJ on objections, the deposition or any part may be introduced into evidence for any purpose if the deponent is unavailable. Only that part of a deposition that is received in evidence at hearing shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding upon which a decision may be based. Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the use of a deposition for impeachment purposes.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> Fees shall be paid by the person upon whose application the deposition is taken.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Supplementation of responses.</E> A party who has responded to a request <PRTPAGE P="258"/>for discovery by providing a response is under a duty to timely amend any prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission if so ordered by the ALJ, or if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to all other parties during the discovery process or in writing.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Motions to compel.</E> (1) In connection with any discovery procedure, by motion addressed to the ALJ and upon a showing of a good faith attempt to resolve the issue without the ALJ's intervention, either party may file a motion to compel a response with respect to any objection or other failure to respond to the discovery requested or to any part thereof, or any failure to respond as specifically requested. An evasive or incomplete answer to a request for discovery is treated as a failure to answer.</P>
              <P>(2) The motion shall describe the information sought, cite the opposing party's objection, and provide arguments supporting the motion.</P>
              <P>(3) The opposing party may file a response to the motion, including a request for a protective order in accordance with § 26.44.</P>
              <P>(4) Orders compelling discovery shall be issued only where such discovery will not compel the disclosure of privileged information, unduly delay the hearing, or result in prejudice to the public interest or the rights of the parties, and upon a showing of good cause.</P>
              <P>(5) A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the ALJ may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause or, when the party's refusal to provide the information sought is solely due to undue expense, the party seeking the discovery agrees to bear the expense associated with the request.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Refusal to honor discovery order.</E> When a party refuses to honor a discovery order, the ALJ may issue such orders in regard to the refusal as justice shall require, including the imposition of sanctions pursuant to § 26.34.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon written request of a party, the ALJ may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing, and/or the production of documents. The request shall specify any documents to be produced and shall list the names and addresses of the witnesses.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time of request.</E> A request for a subpoena in aid of discovery shall be filed in time to permit the conclusion of discovery 15 days before the date fixed for the hearing. A request for a subpoena to testify at the hearing shall be filed at least 3 days prior to the hearing, unless otherwise allowed by the ALJ for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content.</E> The subpoena shall specify the time and place at which the witness is to appear and any documents the witness is to produce.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Service and fees.</E> Subpoenas shall be served, and fees and costs paid to subpoenaed witnesses, in accordance with Rule 45(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Motion to quash.</E> The individual to whom the subpoena is directed or a party may file a motion to quash the subpoena within 10 days after service, or on or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance if it is less than 10 days after service.</P>

              <P>(a) A party, a prospective witness, or a deponent may file a motion for a protective order with respect to discovery sought by an opposing party or with respect to the hearing, seeking to limit the availability or disclosure of evidence.</P>
              <P>(b) Protective orders may be issued by an ALJ if the ALJ determines such an order is necessary to protect a party or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense because:</P>

              <P>(1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that <PRTPAGE P="259"/>is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;</P>
              <P>(2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or</P>
              <P>(3) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.</P>

However, if any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary or designee that additional evidence not presented at the hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the Secretary or designee shall remand the matter to the ALJ for reconsideration in light of the additional evidence.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Ex parte communications.</E> The prohibitions of ex parte communications in § 26.33 shall apply to contacts with the Secretary or designee.</P>

The Secretary, or designee, may extend the time in which a written determination must be issued by an additional 60 days for good cause shown in a written justification issued to the parties. The written decision of the Secretary shall be the final agency action. If the Secretary, or designee, does not act upon the appeal of an initial decision within 90 days of service of the appeal, then the initial determination shall be the final agency action.</P>

The written decision of the Secretary shall be the final agency action.

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this subpart is to implement requirements for the administration of the Multifamily Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1981 (the Act) (12 U.S.C. 3701-3717), that clarify, or are in addition to, the requirements contained in the Act, which are not republished here and must be consulted in conjunction with the requirements of this subpart. The Act creates a uniform Federal remedy for foreclosure of multifamily mortgages. Under a delegation of authority published on February 5, 1982 (47 FR 5468), the Secretary has delegated to the HUD General Counsel his powers under the Act to appoint a foreclosure commissioner or commissioners and to substitute therefor, to fix the compensation of commissioners, and to promulgate implementing regulations.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 27.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Under the Act and this subpart, the Secretary may foreclose on any defaulted Secretary-held multifamily mortgage encumbering real estate in any State. The Secretary may use the provisions of these regulations to foreclose on any multifamily mortgage regardless of when the mortgage was executed.</P>
            <P>(b) The Secretary may, at the Secretary's option, use other procedures to foreclose defaulted multifamily mortgages, including judicial foreclosure in Federal court and nonjudicial foreclosure under State law. This subpart applies only to foreclosure procedures authorized by the Act and not to any other foreclosure procedures the Secretary may use.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The definitions contained in the Act (at 12 U.S.C. 3702) shall apply to this subpart, in addition to and as further clarified by the following definitions. As used in this subpart:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">General Counsel</E> means the General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development;</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Multifamily mortgage</E> does not include a mortgage covering a property on which there is located a one- to four-family residence, except when the one- to four-family residence is subject to a mortgage pursuant to section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q), or section 811 (42 U.S.C. 8013) of the National Affordable Housing Act. The definition of multifamily mortgage also includes a mortgage taken by the Secretary in connection with the previous sale of the project by the Secretary (purchase money mortgage).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Prerequisites to foreclosure.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Before commencement of a foreclosure under the Act and this subpart, HUD will provide to the mortgagor an opportunity informally to present reasons why the mortgage should not be foreclosed. Such opportunity may be provided before or after the designation of the foreclosure commissioner but before service of the notice of default and foreclosure.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 27.10</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Designation of a foreclosure commissioner.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When the Secretary determines that a multifamily mortgage should be foreclosed under the Act and this subpart, the General Counsel will select and designate one or more foreclosure commissioners to conduct the foreclosure and sale. The method of selection and determination of the qualifications of the foreclosure commissioner shall be at the discretion of the General Counsel, and the execution of a designation pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be conclusive evidence that the commissioner selected has been determined to be qualified by the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(b) After selection of a foreclosure commissioner, the General Counsel shall designate the commissioner in writing to conduct the foreclosure and sale of the particular multifamily mortgage. The written designation shall be duly acknowledged and shall state the name and business or residential address of the commissioner and any other information the General Counsel deems necessary. The designation shall be effective upon execution by the General Counsel or his designate. Upon receipt of the designation, the commissioner shall demonstrate acceptance by signing the designation and returning a signed copy to the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(c) The General Counsel may at any time, with or without cause, designate a substitute commissioner to replace a previously designated commissioner. Designation of a substitute commissioner shall be in writing and shall contain the same information and be made effective in the same manner as the designation of the original commissioner. Upon designation of a substitute commissioner, the substitute commissioner shall serve a copy of the written notice of designation upon the persons listed at sections 369(1) (A) through (C) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3708(1) (A) through (C)) either by mail, in accordance with section 369(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3708(1)), except that the time limitations in that section will not apply, or by any other manner which in the substitute commissioner's discretion is conducive to giving timely notice of substitution.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 27.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Notice of default and foreclosure sale.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 45 days after accepting his or her designation to act as commissioner, the commissioner shall commence the foreclosure by serving a Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale.</P>
            <P>(b) The Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale shall contain the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) The Notice shall state that all deposits and the balance of the purchase price shall be paid by certified or cashier's check. The Notice shall state that no deposit will be required of the Secretary when the Secretary bids at the foreclosure sale.</P>
            <P>(2) Any terms and conditions to which the purchaser at the foreclosure sale must agree under § 27.20. The Notice need not describe at length each and every pertinent term and condition, including any required use agreements and deed covenants, if it describes these terms and conditions in a general way and if it states that the precise terms will be available from the commissioner upon request.</P>
            <P>(c) The Notice need not be mailed to mortgagors who have been released from all obligations under the mortgage.</P>
            <P>(d) In deciding which newspaper or newspapers to select as general circulation newspapers for purposes of publication of the required notice, the commissioner need not select the newspaper with the largest circulation.</P>

            <P>(e) In addition to Notice posting requirements included in the Act, the Notice shall also be posted in the project office and in such other appropriate conspicuous places as the commissioner deems appropriate for providing notice to all tenants. Posting <PRTPAGE P="264"/>shall not be required if the commissioner in his or her discretion finds that the act of posting is likely to lead to a breach of the peace or may result in the increased risk of vandalism or damage to the property. Any such finding will be made in writing. Entry on the premises by the commissioner for the purpose of posting shall be privileged as against all other persons.</P>
            <P>(f) When service of the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale is made by mail, the commissioner shall at the same time and in the same manner serve a copy of the instrument by which the General Counsel, under § 27.10(b), has designated him or her to act as commissioner.</P>
            <P>(g) At least 7 days before the foreclosure sale, the commissioner will record both the instrument designating him or her to act as commissioner and the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale in the same office or offices in which the mortgage was recorded.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 27.20</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Conditions of foreclosure sale.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The requirements of section 367(b)(2)(A) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3706(b)(2)(A)) apply if a majority of the residential units in a property subject to foreclosure sale pursuant to the Act and this subpart are occupied by residential tenants either on the date of the foreclosure sale or on the date on which the General Counsel designates the foreclosure commissioner.</P>
            <P>(b) Terms which the Secretary may find appropriate to require pursuant to section 367(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3706(b)), and such other provisions of law as may be applicable, may include provisions relating to use and ownership of the project property, tenant admission standards and procedures, rent schedules and increases, and project operation and maintenance. In determining terms which may be appropriate to require, the Secretary shall consider:</P>
            <P>(1) The history of the project, including the purposes of the program under which the mortgage insurance or assistance was provided, and any other program of HUD under which the project was developed or otherwise assisted and the probable causes of project failure resulting in its default;</P>
            <P>(2) A financial analysis of the project, including an appraisal of the fair market value of the property for its highest and best use;</P>
            <P>(3) A physical analysis of the project, including the condition of the structure and grounds, the need for rehabilitation or repairs, and the estimated costs of any such rehabilitation or repairs;</P>
            <P>(4) The income levels of the occupants of the project;</P>
            <P>(5) Characteristics, including rental levels, of comparable housing in the area, with particular reference to whether current conditions and discernible trends in the area fairly indicate a likelihood that, for the foreseeable future after foreclosure and sale, the project will continue to provide rental or cooperative housing and market rentals obtainable in the project will be affordable by low- or moderate-income persons;</P>
            <P>(6) The availability of or need for rental housing for low- and moderate-income persons in the area, including actions being taken or projected to be taken to address such needs and the impact of such actions on the project;</P>
            <P>(7) An assessment of the number of occupants who might be displaced as a result of the manner of disposition;</P>
            <P>(8) The eligibility of the occupants of the property for rental assistance under any program administered by HUD and the availability of funding for such assistance if necessary in order that the units occupied by such occupants will remain available to and affordable by such persons, or if necessary in order to assure the financial feasibility of the project after foreclosure and sale subject to the terms to be required by the Secretary; and</P>
            <P>(9) Such other factors relating to the project as the Secretary shall consider appropriate.</P>

            <P>(c) Terms which the Secretary may require to be agreed to by the purchaser pursuant to section 367(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3706(b)) shall generally not be more restrictive, or binding for a longer duration, than the terms by which the mortgagor was bound prior to the foreclosure. For example: If the mortgage being foreclosed was held by the Secretary under section 312 of the Housing Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 1452b), <PRTPAGE P="265"/>any terms required by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be in effect no longer than five years after the completion of the rehabilitation work funded by the section 312 loan. No terms shall be required pursuant to this section if the foreclosure sale occurs more than five years after the completion of such rehabilitation work (signified by the due date for commencement of amortization payments in the section 312 loan note).</P>
            <P>(d) The limitation contained in paragraph (c) of this section applies only to such terms as the Secretary may require the purchaser to agree to, as a condition and term of the sale, under paragraph (a) of this section. Nothing contained in paragraph (c) of this section shall prevent the Secretary and the purchaser from entering into a subsidy agreement under any program administered by the Secretary containing terms binding upon either party which are longer in duration than would be permitted to be required by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) Any terms required by the Secretary to be agreed to by the purchaser as a condition and term of sale under this section and section 367(b) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3706(b)) shall be embodied in a use agreement to be executed by the Secretary and the purchaser. Such terms also may be included, or referred to, in appropriate covenants contained in the deed to be delivered by the foreclosure commissioner under § 27.45. Terms required by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be stated or described in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale under § 27.15.</P>
            <P>(f) The defaulting mortgagor, or any principal, successor, affiliate, or assignee thereof, on the multifamily mortgage being foreclosed, shall not be eligible to bid on, or otherwise acquire, the property being foreclosed by the Department under this subpart or any other provision of law. A “principal” and an “affiliate” are defined as provided at 24 CFR 24.105.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Termination or adjournment of foreclosure sale.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before withdrawing the security property from foreclosure under section 369A(a) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3709(a)), the commissioner shall notify the Secretary of the proposed withdrawal by telephone or telegram and shall provide the Secretary with a written statement of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal along with all documents submitted by the mortgagor in support of the proposed withdrawal. Upon receipt of this statement, the Secretary shall have 10 days within which to demonstrate orally or in writing why the security property should not be withdrawn from foreclosure. The Secretary shall provide the mortgagor with a copy of any statement prepared by the Secretary in opposition to the proposed withdrawal at the same time the statement is submitted to the commissioner. If the Secretary receives the commissioner's written statement less than 10 days before the scheduled foreclosure sale, the sale shall automatically be postponed for 14 days. Under these circumstances, notice of the rescheduled sale shall be served as described in section 369B(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3710(c)).</P>
            <P>(b) The commissioner may not withdraw the security property from foreclosure under section 369A(a) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3709(a)) more than once unless the Secretary consents in writing to such withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(c) The commissioner shall, in the case of a sale adjourned to a later date, mail a copy of the revised Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale to the Secretary at least seven days before the date to which the sale has been adjourned.</P>
            <P>(d) If upon application by the mortgagor, the commissioner refuses to withdraw the property from foreclosure under section 369A(a) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3709(a)), the commissioner shall provide the mortgagor and the Secretary with a written statement of the reasons for the refusal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Conduct of the sale.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) The commissioner shall accept written one-price sealed bids from any party including the Secretary so long <PRTPAGE P="266"/>as those bids conform to the requirements described in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. The commissioner shall announce the name of each such bidder and the amount of the bid. The commissioner shall accept oral bids from any party, including parties who submitted one-price sealed bids, if those oral bids conform to the requirements described in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. The commissioner will announce the amount of the high bid and the name of the successful bidder before the close of the sale.</P>
            <P>(b) Relatives of the commissioner who may not bid at the foreclosure sale include parents, siblings, spouses and children. Related business entities which may not bid include entities or concerns whose relationship with the commissioner at the time the commissioner is designated is such that, directly or indirectly, one concern or individual formulates, directs, or controls the other concern; or has the power to formulate, direct, or control the other concern; or has the responsibility and authority either to prevent in the first instance, or promptly to correct, the offensive conduct of the other concern. Business concerns are also affiliates of each other when a third party is similarly situated with respect to both concerns.</P>
            <P>(c) If the commissioner employs an auctioneer to conduct the foreclosure sale, the auctioneer must be a licensed auctioneer, an officer of State or local government, or any other person who commonly conducts foreclosure sales in the area in which the security property is located.</P>

            <P>(b) If there is more than one party holding a lien or assessment payable from sales proceeds, the claim of each party holding the same kind of lien or assessment will be given the relative priority to which it would be entitled under the law of the State in which the security property is located.</P>
            <P>(c) The commissioner will keep such records as will permit the Secretary to verify the costs claimed under section 369C of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3711), and otherwise to audit the commissioner's disposition of the sale proceeds.</P>

            <P>(b) To obtain a presale reinstatement in cases involving a monetary default, there must be tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed all amounts which would be due under the mortgage agreement if payments under the mortgage had not been accelerated and all costs of foreclosure incurred for which payment from the proceeds of foreclosure is provided in the Statute, and the foreclosure commissioner must find that there are no nonmonetary defaults; provided, however, that the Secretary may refuse to cancel a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subparagraph if the current mortgagor or owner of record has, on one or more previous occasions, caused a foreclosure of the mortgage, commenced pursuant to the Statute and this subpart or otherwise, to be canceled by curing a default.</P>
            <P>(c) To obtain a presale reinstatement in cases involving a nonmonetary default:</P>
            <P>(1) The foreclosure commissioner, upon application of the mortgagor before the date of foreclosure sale, must find that all nonmonetary defaults are cured and that there are no monetary defaults; and</P>

If the Secretary receives the foreclosure commissioner's written statement less than 10 days before the scheduled foreclosure sale, the sale shall automatically be adjourned for 14 days, during which time it may be cancelled. Notice of the re-scheduled sale, if any, shall be served as described in § 27.111.</P>

            <P>(b) In addition to bids made in person at the sale, the foreclosure commissioner shall accept written one-price sealed bids from any party, including the Secretary, for entry by announcement at the sale so long as those bids conform to the requirements described in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. The foreclosure commissioner shall announce the name of each such bidder and the amount of the bid. The commissioner shall accept oral bids from any party, including parties who submitted one-price sealed bids, if those oral bids conform to the requirements in the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale. Before the close of the sale the commissioner shall announce the amount of the high bid and the name of the successful bidder. If the successful bidder fails to comply with the terms of the sale, the HUD Field Office representative will provide instructions to the commissioner about offering the property to the second highest bidder, or having a new sale, or other instruction at the discretion of the HUD representative.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibited participants.</E> Relatives of the foreclosure commissioner who may not bid include parents, siblings, spouses and children. A related business entity that may not bid or whose employees may not bid is one whose relationship (at the time the foreclosure commissioner is designated and during the term of service as foreclosure commissioner) with the entity of the foreclosure commissioner is such that, directly or indirectly, one entity formulates, directs, or controls the other entity; or has the power to formulate, direct, or control the other entity; or has the responsibility and authority to prevent, or promptly to correct, the offensive conduct of the other entity.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Auctioneers.</E> If the commissioner employs an auctioneer to conduct the foreclosure sale, the auctioneer must be a licensed auctioneer, an officer of State or local government, or any other person who commonly conducts foreclosure sales in the area in which the security property is located.</P>

The publication of the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale, revised pursuant to the Statute, may be made on any of three separate days before the revised date of foreclosure sale. If there is no newspaper of general circulation that would permit publication on any of three separate days before the revised date of foreclosure sale, the Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale must be posted, not less than nine days before the date to which the sale has been adjourned, at the courthouse of any county or counties in which the property is located, and at the place where the sale is to be held. The commissioner must also, in the case of a sale adjourned to a later date, mail a copy of the revised Notice of Default and Foreclosure Sale to the Secretary at least seven days before the date to which the sale has been adjourned.</P>
            <P>(b) When a substitute commissioner is designated by the Secretary to replace a previously designated foreclosure commissioner, the sale shall continue without prejudice unless the substitute commissioner finds, in that commissioner's sole discretion, that continuation of the foreclosure sale will unfairly affect the interests of the mortgagor. Any such finding shall be in writing. If the substitute commissioner makes such a finding, the substitute commissioner shall cancel or adjourn the sale.</P>

Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating fraudulent conduct, and the need for deterrence, ordinarily twice the amount of the claim as alleged by the government, and a significant civil penalty, should be imposed. The amount of penalties and assessments imposed shall be based on the ALJ's and the Secretary's or designee's consideration of evidence in support of one or more of the following factors:</P>
          <P>(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;</P>
          <P>(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;</P>
          <P>(3) The degree of the respondent's culpability with respect to the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;</P>
          <P>(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the cost of investigation;</P>
          <P>(6) The relationship of the civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;</P>
          <P>(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;</P>
          <P>(8) Whether the respondent has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;</P>
          <P>(9) Whether the respondent attempted to conceal the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(10) The degree to which the respondent has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;</P>
          <P>(11) If the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the respondent, the extent to which the respondent's practices fostered or attempted to preclude the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(12) Whether the respondent cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;</P>
          <P>(13) Whether the respondent assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;</P>
          <P>(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the respondent's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the respondent's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;</P>
          <P>(15) Whether the respondent has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly;</P>
          <P>(16) The need to deter the respondent and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and</P>
          <P>(17) The respondent's ability to pay, and</P>
          <P>(18) Any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the seriousness of the false claim or statement.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Stays ordered by the Department of Justice.</E> If at any time the Attorney General of the United States or an Assistant Attorney General designated by the Attorney General notifies the Secretary in writing that continuation of HUD's case may adversely affect any pending or potential criminal or civil <PRTPAGE P="275"/>action related to the claim or statement at issue, the ALJ or the Secretary shall stay the process immediately. The case may be resumed only upon receipt of the written authorization of the Attorney General.</P>

            <P>This subpart implements the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 4852d, which impose certain requirements on the sale or lease of target housing. Under this subpart, a seller or lessor of target housing shall disclose to the purchaser or lessee the presence of any known lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards; provide available records and reports; provide the purchaser or lessee with a lead hazard information pamphlet; give purchasers a 10-day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment or inspection; and attach specific disclosure and warning language to the sales or leasing contract before the purchaser or lessee is obligated under a contract to purchase or lease target housing.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This subpart applies to all transactions to sell or lease target housing, including subleases, with the exception of the following:</P>
            <P>(a) Sales of target housing at foreclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) Leases of target housing that have been found to be lead-based paint free by an inspector certified under the Federal certification program or under a federally accredited State or tribal certification program. Until a Federal certification program or federally accredited State certification program is in place within the State, inspectors shall be considered qualified to conduct an inspection for this purpose if they have received certification under any existing State or tribal inspector certification program. The lessor has the option of using the results of additional test(s) by a certified inspector to confirm or refute a prior finding.</P>

            <P>(c) Short-term leases of 100 days or less, where no lease renewal or extension can occur.<PRTPAGE P="287"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) Renewals of existing leases in target housing in which the lessor has previously disclosed all information required under § 35.88 and where no new information described in § 35.88 has come into the possession of the lessor. For the purposes of this paragraph, renewal shall include both renegotiation of existing lease terms and/or ratification of a new lease.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The requirements of subparts B through R of this part are promulgated to implement the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4821 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), and the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability</E>—(1) <E T="03">This subpart.</E> This subpart applies to all target housing that is federally owned and target housing receiving Federal assistance to <PRTPAGE P="292"/>which subparts C, D, F through M, and R of this part apply, except where indicated.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other subparts</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> Subparts C, D, and F through M of this part each set forth requirements for a specific type of Federal housing activity or assistance, such as multifamily mortgage insurance, project-based rental assistance, rehabilitation, or tenant-based rental assistance. Subpart R of this part provides standards and methods for activities required in subparts B, C, D, and F through M of this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Application to programs.</E> Most HUD housing programs are covered by only one subpart of this part, but some programs can be used for more than one type of assistance and therefore are covered by more than one subpart of this part. A current list of programs covered by each subpart of this part is available on the internet at <E T="03">www.hud.gov,</E> or by mail from the National Lead Information Center at 1-800-424-LEAD. Examples of flexible programs that can provide more than one type of assistance are the HOME Investment Partnerships program, the Community Development Block Grant program, and the Indian Housing Block Grant Program. Grantees, participating jurisdictions, Indian tribes and other entities administering such flexible programs must decide which subpart applies to the type of assistance being provided to a particular dwelling unit or residential property.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Application to dwelling units.</E> In some cases, more than one type of assistance may be provided to the same dwelling unit. In such cases, the subpart or section with the most protective initial hazard reduction requirements applies. Paragraph (c) of this section provides a table that lists the subparts and sections of this part in order from the most protective to the least protective. (This list is based only on the requirements for initial hazard reduction. The summary of requirements on this list is not a complete list of requirements. It is necessary to refer to the applicable subparts and sections to determine all applicable requirements.)</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Example.</E> A multifamily building has 100 dwelling units and was built in 1965. The property is financed with HUD multifamily mortgage insurance. This building is covered by subpart G of this part (see § 35.625—Multifamily mortgage insurance for properties constructed after 1959), which is at protectiveness level 5 in the table set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In the same building, however, 50 of the 100 dwelling units are receiving project-based assistance, and the average annual assistance per assisted unit is $5,500. Those 50 units, and common areas servicing those units, are covered by the requirements of subpart H of this part (see § 35.715—Project-based assistance for multifamily properties receiving more than $5,000 per unit), which are at protectiveness level 3. Therefore, because level 3 is a higher level of protectiveness than level 5, the units receiving project-based assistance, and common areas servicing those units, must comply at level 3, while the rest of the building can be operated at level 5. The owner may choose to operate the entire building at level 3 for simplicity.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Table One.</E> The following table lists the subparts and sections of this part applying to HUD programs in order from most protective to least protective hazard reduction requirements. The summary of hazard reduction requirements in this table is not complete. Readers must refer to relevant subpart for complete requirements.</P>

The requirements of this paragraph apply regardless of whether the child is or is not still living in the unit when the owner receives the notification of the elevated blood lead level. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the owner conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date when the owner received the notification of the elevated blood lead level. If the owner conducted a risk assessment of the unit and common areas servicing the unit during that period, the owner need not conduct another risk assessment there but shall conduct the elements of an environmental investigation not already conducted during the risk assessment.

Lead-based paint hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the environmental investigation have been treated with interim controls or abatement or the public health department certifies that the lead-based paint hazard reduction is complete. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the owner, between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date the owner received the notification of the elevated blood lead level, already conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit and completed reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards.

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Other assisted dwelling units in the property.</E> (1) If the environmental investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section identifies lead-based paint hazards, the owner shall, for other assisted dwelling units covered by this part in which a child under age 6 resides or is expected to reside on the date lead-based paint hazard reduction under paragraph (c) of this section is complete, and for the common areas servicing those units, conduct a risk assessment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the environmental investigation report if there are 20 or fewer such other units, or 60 calendar days if there are more than 20 such other units.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Control measures.</E> If the risk assessment conducted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section identifies lead-based paint hazards, the owner shall complete the reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards in accordance with § 35.1325 or § 35.1330 in those units and common areas within 30 calendar days, or within 90 calendar days if more than 20 units have lead-based paint hazards such that the control work would disturb painted surfaces that total more than the de minimis threshold of § 35.1350(d). Lead-based paint hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the risk assessment have been treated with interim controls or abatement.</P>

            <P>(4) The requirements of this paragraph (f) do not apply if:</P>

            <P>(i) The owner both conducted a risk assessment of the other assisted dwelling units covered by paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the common areas servicing those units, and conducted reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards in accordance with § 35.1325 or § 35.1330 between the date the child's <PRTPAGE P="310"/>blood was last sampled and the date the owner received the notification of the elevated blood lead level; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The owner has documentation of compliance with evaluation, notification, lead disclosure, ongoing lead-based paint maintenance, and lead-based paint management requirements under this part throughout the 12 months preceding the date the owner received the environmental investigation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iii) In either case, the owner provides to the HUD field office documentation that it has conducted the activities of paragraphs (f)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, within 10 business days of the deadline for each activity.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Calculating Federal rehabilitation assistance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to recipients of Federal rehabilitation assistance.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation assistance.</E> (1) Lead-based paint requirements for rehabilitation fall into three categories that depend on the amount of Federal rehabilitation assistance provided. The three categories are:</P>
            <P>(i) Assistance of up to and including $5,000 per unit;</P>
            <P>(ii) Assistance of more than $5,000 per unit up to and including $25,000 per unit; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Assistance of more than $25,000 per unit.</P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of implementing §§ 35.930 and 35.935, the amount of rehabilitation assistance is the lesser of two amounts: the average Federal assistance per assisted dwelling unit and the average per unit hard costs of rehabilitation. Federal assistance includes all Federal funds assisting the project, regardless of the use of the funds. Federal funds being used for acquisition of the property are to be included as well as funds for construction, permits, fees, and other project costs. The hard costs of rehabilitation include all hard costs, regardless of source, except that the costs of lead-based paint hazard evaluation and hazard reduction activities are not to be included. Costs of site preparation, occupant protection, relocation, interim controls, abatement, clearance, and waste handling attributable to compliance with the requirements of this part are not to be included in the hard costs of rehabilitation. All other hard costs are to be included, regardless of whether the source of funds is Federal or non-Federal, public or private.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculating rehabilitation assistance in properties with both assisted and unassisted dwelling units.</E> For a residential property that includes both federally assisted and non-assisted units, the rehabilitation costs and Federal assistance associated with non-assisted units are not included in the calculations of the average per unit hard costs of rehabilitation and the average Federal assistance per unit.</P>

            <P>(1) The average per unit hard costs of rehabilitation for the assisted units is calculated using the following formula:

            <SUBJECT>Examples of determining applicable requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The following examples illustrate how to determine whether the requirements of §§ 35.930(b), (c), or (d) apply to a dwelling unit receiving Federal rehabilitation assistance (dollar amounts are on a per unit basis):</P>
            <P>(a) If the total amount of Federal assistance for a dwelling is $2,000, and the hard costs of rehabilitation are $10,000, the lead-based paint requirements would be those described in § 35.930(b), because Federal rehabilitation assistance is up to and including $5,000.</P>
            <P>(b) If the total amount of Federal assistance for a dwelling unit is $6,000, and the hard costs of rehabilitation are $2,000, the lead-based paint requirements would be those described in § 35.930(b). Although the total amount of Federal dollars is more than $5,000, only the $2,000 of that total can be applied to rehabilitation. Therefore, the Federal rehabilitation assistance is $2,000 which is not more than $5,000.</P>

            <P>(c) If the total amount of Federal assistance for a unit is $6,000, and the hard costs of rehabilitation are $6,000, the lead-based paint requirements are those described in § 35.930(c), because the amount of Federal rehabilitation assistance is more than $5,000 but not more than $25,000.<PRTPAGE P="315"/>
            </P>
            <P>(d) If eight dwelling units in a residential property receive Federal rehabilitation assistance [symbol c in § 35.915(c)(2)] out of a total of 10 dwelling units [d], the total Federal assistance for the rehabilitation project is $300,000 [e], the total hard costs of rehabilitation for the dwelling units are $160,000 [a], and the total hard costs of rehabilitation for the common areas and exterior surfaces are $20,000 [b], then the lead-based paint requirements would be those described in § 35.930(c), because the level of Federal rehabilitation assistance is $22,000, which is not greater than $25,000. This is calculated as follows: The total Federal assistance per assisted unit is $37,500 (e/c = $300,000/8), the per unit hard costs of rehabilitation is $22,000 (a/c + b/d = $160,000/8 + $20,000/10), and the level of Federal rehabilitation assistance is the lesser of $37,500 and $22,000.</P>

The environmental investigation is considered complete when the PHA receives the environmental investigation report. The requirements of this paragraph apply regardless of whether the child is or is not still living in the unit when the PHA receives the notification of the elevated blood lead level. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the PHA conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date when the PHA received the notification of the elevated blood lead level. If the PHA conducted a risk assessment of the unit and common areas servicing the unit during that period, the PHA need not conduct another risk assessment there but shall conduct the elements of an environmental investigation not already conducted during the risk assessment.

Lead-based paint hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the environmental investigation have been treated with interim controls or abatement or the local or State health department certifies that the lead-based paint hazard reduction is complete. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the PHA, between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date the PHA received the notification of the elevated blood lead level, already conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit and completed reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards. If the PHA conducted a risk assessment of the unit and common areas servicing the unit during that period, it is not required to conduct another risk assessment there but it shall conduct the elements of an environmental investigation not already conducted during the risk assessment. If the PHA does not complete the lead-based paint hazard reduction required by this section, the dwelling unit is in violation of the standards of 24 CFR 965.601, which incorporates the uniform physical condition standards of § 5.703(f), including that it be free of lead-based paint hazards.</P>

When the environmental investigation is complete, the designated party shall immediately provide the report of the environmental investigation to the owner of the dwelling unit. If the child identified as having an elevated blood lead level is no longer living in the unit when the designated party receives notification from the public health department or other medical health care provider, but another household receiving tenant-based rental assistance is living in the unit or is planning to live there, the requirements of this section apply just as they do if the child still lives in the unit. If a public health department has already conducted an evaluation of the dwelling unit in regard to the child's elevated blood lead level case, or the designated party conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date when the designated party received the notification of the elevated blood lead level, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply.

If the public health department or provider denies the request, such as because it does not have the capacity to verify that information, the designated party shall send documentation of the denial to the HUD rental assistance program manager, who shall make an effort to verify the information. If that department or provider verifies that the child has an elevated blood lead level, such verification shall constitute notification, and the designated party shall take the action required in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Lead-based paint hazard reduction.</E> Within 30 calendar days after receiving the report of the environmental investigation from the designated party or the evaluation from the public health department, the owner shall complete <PRTPAGE P="324"/>the reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards in accordance with § 35.1325 or § 35.1330. Lead-based paint hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the environmental investigation have been treated with interim controls or abatement or the public health department certifies that the lead-based paint hazard reduction is complete. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply if the designated party or the owner, between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date the designated party received the notification of the elevated blood lead level, already conducted an environmental investigation of the unit and common areas servicing the unit and the owner completed reduction of identified lead-based paint hazards.

            <P>(3) The owner shall provide to the HUD field office documentation that it has conducted the activities of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, within 10 business days of the deadline for each activity.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Other assisted dwelling units in the property.</E> (1) If the environmental investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section identifies lead-based paint hazards, the designated party or the owner shall, for other assisted dwelling units covered by this part in which a child under age 6 resides or is expected to reside on the date lead-based paint hazard reduction under paragraph (c) of this section is complete, and the common areas servicing those units, conduct a risk assessment in accordance with § 35.1320(b) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the environmental investigation report if there are 20 or fewer such units, or 60 calendar days if there are more such units.</P>
            <P>(2) If the risk assessment conducted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section identifies lead-based paint hazards, the owner shall complete the reduction of the lead-based paint hazards in accordance with § 35.1325 or § 35.1330 within 30 calendar days, or within 90 calendar days if more than 20 units have lead-based paint hazards such that the control work would disturb painted surfaces that total more than the de minimis threshold of § 35.1350(d). Lead-based paint hazard reduction is considered complete when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340 and the clearance report states that all lead-based paint hazards identified in the risk assessment have been treated with interim controls or abatement.</P>

            <P>(i) The designated party or the owner, between the date the child's blood was last sampled and the date the owner received the notification of the elevated blood lead level, both conducted a risk assessment of the other assisted dwelling units covered by paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the common areas servicing those units, and the owner conducted interim controls of identified lead-based paint hazards in accordance with § 35.1225(c); or</P>
            <P>(ii) The owner has documentation of compliance with evaluation, notification, lead disclosure, ongoing lead-based paint maintenance, and lead-based paint management requirements under this part throughout the 12 months preceding the date the owner received the environmental investigation report pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section; and,</P>

            <P>(iii) In either case, the owner provided the HUD field office, within 10 <PRTPAGE P="325"/>business days after receiving the notification of the elevated blood lead level, documentation that it has conducted the activities described in this paragraph (f)(3).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Data collection and record keeping responsibilities.</E> At least quarterly, the designated party shall attempt to obtain from the public health department(s) with area(s) of jurisdiction similar to that of the designated party the names and/or addresses of children of less than 6 years of age with an identified elevated blood lead level. At least quarterly, the designated party shall also report an updated list of the addresses of units receiving assistance under a tenant-based rental assistance program to the same public health department(s), except that the report(s) to the public health department(s) is not required if the health department states that it does not wish to receive such report. If it obtains names and addresses of elevated blood lead level children from the public health department(s), the designated party shall match information on cases of elevated blood lead levels with the names and addresses of families receiving tenant-based rental assistance, unless the public health department performs such a matching procedure.</P>

If clearance is being performed after lead-based paint hazard reduction, paint stabilization, maintenance, or rehabilitation that affected exterior surfaces but did not disturb interior painted surfaces or involve elimination of an interior dust-lead hazard, interior clearance is not required if window, door, ventilation, and other openings are sealed during the exterior work. If clearance is being performed for more than 10 dwelling units of similar construction and maintenance, as in a multifamily property, random sampling for the purpose of clearance may be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 745.227(e)(9).</P>
            <P>(ii) The visual assessment shall be performed to determine if deteriorated paint surfaces and/or visible amounts of dust, debris, paint chips or other residue are still present. Both exterior and interior painted surfaces shall be examined for the presence of deteriorated paint. If deteriorated paint or visible dust, debris or residue are present in areas subject to dust sampling, they must be eliminated prior to the continuation of the clearance examination, except elimination of deteriorated paint is not required if it has been determined, through paint testing or a lead-based paint inspection, that the deteriorated paint is not lead-based paint. If exterior painted surfaces have been disturbed by the hazard reduction, maintenance or rehabilitation activity, the visual assessment shall include an assessment of the ground and any outdoor living areas close to the affected exterior painted surfaces. Visible dust or debris in living areas shall be cleaned up and visible paint chips on the ground shall be removed.</P>
            <P>(iii) Dust samples shall be wipe samples and shall be taken on floors and, where practicable, interior window sills and window troughs. Dust samples shall be collected and analyzed in accordance with § 35.1315 of this part.</P>
            <P>(iv) Clearance reports shall be prepared in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Clearance report.</E> When clearance is required, the designated party shall ensure that a clearance report is prepared that provides documentation of the hazard reduction or maintenance activity as well as the clearance examination. When abatement is performed, the report shall be an abatement report in accordance with 40 CFR 745.227(e)(10). When another hazard reduction or maintenance activity requiring a clearance report is performed, the report shall include the following information:<PRTPAGE P="331"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) The address of the residential property and, if only part of a multifamily property is affected, the specific dwelling units and common areas affected.</P>

            <P>(i) The date(s) of the clearance examination;</P>
            <P>(ii) The name, address, and signature of each person performing the clearance examination, including certification number;</P>
            <P>(iii) The results of the visual assessment for the presence of deteriorated paint and visible dust, debris, residue or paint chips;</P>
            <P>(iv) The results of the analysis of dust samples, in µg/sq.ft., by location of sample; and</P>
            <P>(v) The name and address of each laboratory that conducted the analysis of the dust samples, including the identification number for each such laboratory recognized by EPA under section 405(b) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2685(b)).</P>
            <P>(3) The following information on the hazard reduction or maintenance activity for which clearance was performed:</P>
            <P>(i) The start and completion dates of the hazard reduction or maintenance activity;</P>
            <P>(ii) The name and address of each firm or organization conducting the hazard reduction or maintenance activity and the name of each supervisor assigned;</P>
            <P>(iii) A detailed written description of the hazard reduction or maintenance activity, including the methods used, locations of exterior surfaces, interior rooms, common areas, and/or components where the hazard reduction activity occurred, and any suggested monitoring of encapsulants or enclosures; and</P>
            <P>(iv) If soil hazards were reduced, a detailed description of the location(s) of the hazard reduction activity and the method(s) used.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Standards.</E> The clearance standards in § 35.1320(b)(2) shall apply. If test results equal or exceed the standards, the dwelling unit, worksite, or common area represented by the sample fails the clearance examination.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Clearance failure.</E> All surfaces represented by a failed clearance sample shall be recleaned or treated by hazard reduction, and retested, until the applicable clearance level in § 35.1320(b)(2) is met.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Independence.</E> Clearance examinations shall be performed by persons or entities independent of those performing hazard reduction or maintenance activities, unless the designated party uses qualified in-house employees to conduct clearance. An in-house employee shall not conduct both a hazard reduction or maintenance activity and its clearance examination.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Worksite clearance.</E> Clearance of only the worksite is permitted after work covered by §§ 35.930, 35.1330, 35.1335, or 35.1355, when containment is used to ensure that dust and debris generated by the work is kept within the worksite. Otherwise, clearance must be of the entire dwelling unit, common area, or outbuilding, as applicable. When clearance is of an interior worksite that is not an entire dwelling unit, common area, or outbuilding, dust samples shall be taken for paragraph (b) of this section as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Sample, from each of at least four rooms, hallways, stairwells, or common areas within the dust containment area:</P>
            <P>(i) The floor (one sample); and</P>

            <P>(3) Each reevaluation shall be performed by a certified risk assessor.</P>

            <P>(4) Each reevaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the following schedule if a risk assessment or other evaluation has found deteriorated lead-based paint in the residential property, a soil-lead hazard, or a dust-lead hazard on a floor or interior window sill. (Window troughs are not sampled during reevaluation). The first reevaluation shall be conducted no later than two years from completion <PRTPAGE P="334"/>of hazard reduction. Subsequent reevaluation shall be conducted at intervals of two years, plus or minus 60 days. To be exempt from additional reevaluation, at least two consecutive reevaluations conducted at such two-year intervals must be conducted without finding lead-based paint hazards or a failure of an encapsulation or enclosure. If, however, a reevaluation finds lead-based paint hazards or a failure, at least two more consecutive reevaluations conducted at such two year intervals must be conducted without finding lead-based paint hazards or a failure.</P>
            <P>(5) Each reevaluation shall be performed as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Dwelling units and common areas shall be selected and reevaluated in accordance with § 35.1320(b).</P>
            <P>(ii) The worksites of previous hazard reduction activities that are similar on the basis of their original lead-based paint hazard and type of treatment shall be grouped. Worksites within such groups shall be selected and reevaluated in accordance with § 35.1320(b).</P>
            <P>(6) Each reevaluation shall include reviewing available information, conducting selected visual assessment, recommending responses to hazard reduction omissions or failures, performing selected evaluation of paint, soil and dust, and recommending response to newly-found lead-based paint hazards.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Review of available information.</E> The risk assessor shall review any available past evaluation, hazard reduction and clearance reports, and any other available information describing hazard reduction measures, ongoing maintenance activities, and relevant building operations.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Visual assessment.</E> The risk assessor shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Visually evaluate all lead-based paint hazard reduction treatments, any known or suspected lead-based paint, any deteriorated paint, and each exterior site, and shall identify any new areas of bare soil;</P>
            <P>(B) Determine acceptable options for controlling the hazard; and</P>
            <P>(C) Await the correction of any hazard reduction omission or failure and the reduction of any lead-based paint hazard before sampling any dust or soil the risk assessor determines may reasonably be associated with such hazard.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Reaction to hazard reduction omission or failure.</E> If any hazard reduction control has not been implemented or is failing (e.g., an encapsulant is peeling away from the wall, a paint-stabilized surface is no longer intact, or gravel covering an area of bare soil has worn away), or deteriorated lead-based paint is present, the risk assessor shall:</P>
            <P>(A) Determine acceptable options for controlling the hazard; and</P>
            <P>(B) Await the correction of any hazard reduction omission or failure and the reduction of any lead-based paint hazard before sampling any dust or soil the risk assessor determines may reasonably be associated with such hazard.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Selected paint, soil and dust evaluation.</E> (A) The risk assessor shall sample deteriorated paint surfaces identified during the visual assessment and have the samples analyzed, in accordance with 40 CFR 745.227(b)(3)(4), but only if reliable information about lead content is unavailable.</P>
            <P>(B) The risk assessor shall evaluate new areas of bare soil identified during the visual assessment. Soil samples shall be collected and analyzed in accordance with 40 CFR 745.227(d)(8)-(11), but only if the soil lead levels have not been previously measured.</P>
            <P>(C) The risk assessor shall take selected dust samples and have them analyzed. Dust samples shall be collected and analyzed in accordance with § 35.1320(b). At least two composite samples, one from floors and the other from interior window sills, shall be taken in each dwelling unit and common area selected. Each composite sample shall consist of four individual samples, each collected from a different room or area. If the dwelling unit contains both carpeted and uncarpeted living areas, separate floor samples are required from the carpeted and uncarpeted areas. Equivalent single-surface sampling may be used instead of composite sampling.</P>

            <P>(7) The risk assessor shall provide the designated party with a written report documenting the presence or absence of lead-based paint hazards, the current status of any hazard reduction and <PRTPAGE P="335"/>standard treatment measures used previously and any newly-conducted evaluation and hazard reduction activities. The report shall include the information in 40 CFR 745.227(d)(11), and shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Identify any lead-based paint hazards previously detected and discuss the effectiveness of any hazard reduction or standard treatment measures used, and list those for which no measures have been used.</P>
            <P>(ii) Describe any new hazards found and present the owner with acceptable control options and their accompanying reevaluation schedules.</P>
            <P>(iii) Identify when the next reevaluation, if any, must occur, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Response to the reevaluation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Hazard reduction omission or failure found by a reevaluation.</E> The designated party shall respond in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section to a report by the risk assessor of a hazard reduction control that has not been implemented or is failing, or that deteriorated lead-based paint is present.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Newly-identified lead-based paint hazard found by a reevaluation.</E> The designated party shall treat each:</P>
            <P>(i) Dust-lead hazard or paint lead hazard by cleaning or hazard reduction measures, which are considered completed when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340.</P>
            <P>(ii) Soil-lead hazard by hazard reduction measures, which are considered completed when clearance is achieved in accordance with § 35.1340.</P>

            <P>(1) The person must relocate temporarily because continued occupancy of the dwelling unit constitutes a substantial danger to the health or safety of the person or the public; or</P>
            <P>(2) The person is displaced from a “lower-income dwelling unit,” none of the comparable replacement dwelling units to which the person has been referred qualifies as a lower-income dwelling unit, and a suitable lower-income dwelling unit is scheduled to become available in accordance with § 42.375.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Replacement housing assistance.</E> Persons are eligible to receive one of the following two forms of replacement housing assistance:</P>
            <P>(1) Each person must be offered rental assistance equal to 60 times the amount necessary to reduce the monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities for a replacement dwelling (comparable replacement dwelling or decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling to which the person relocates, whichever costs less) to the “Total Tenant Payment,” as determined under part 813 of this title. All or a portion of this assistance may be offered through a certificate or voucher for rental assistance (if available) provided under Section 8. If a Section 8 certificate or voucher is provided to a person, the recipient must provide referrals to comparable replacement dwelling units where the owner is willing to participate in the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Existing Housing Program (see part 982 of this title). When provided, cash assistance will generally be in installments, in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 3537c; or</P>

            <P>(2) If the person purchases an interest in a housing cooperative or mutual housing association and occupies a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the cooperative or association, the person may elect to receive a payment equal to the capitalized value of 60 times the amount that is obtained by subtracting the “Total Tenant Payment,” as determined under part 813 of this title, from the monthly rent and estimated average monthly cost of utilities at a comparable replacement dwelling unit. To compute the capitalized value, the installments shall be discounted at the rate of interest paid on passbook savings deposits by a federally insured financial institution conducting business within the recipient's jurisdiction. To the extent necessary to minimize hardship to the household, the recipient <PRTPAGE P="342"/>shall, subject to appropriate safeguards, issue a payment in advance of the purchase of the interest in the housing cooperative or mutual housing association.</P>

            <SUBJECT>One-for-one replacement of lower-income dwelling units.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Units that must be replaced.</E> All occupied and vacant occupiable lower-income dwelling units that are demolished or converted to a use other than as lower-income dwelling units in connection with an assisted activity must be replaced with comparable lower-income dwelling units.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acceptable replacement units.</E> Replacement lower-income dwelling units may be provided by any government agency or private developer and must meet the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The units must be located within the recipient's jurisdiction. To the extent feasible and consistent with other statutory priorities, the units shall be located within the same neighborhood as the units replaced.</P>
            <P>(2) The units must be sufficient in number and size to house no fewer than the number of occupants who could have been housed in the units that are demolished or converted. The number of occupants who could have been housed in units shall be determined in accordance with applicable local housing occupancy codes. The recipient may not replace those units with smaller units (e.g., a 2-bedroom unit with two 1-bedroom units), unless the recipient has provided the information required under paragraph (c)(7) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The units must be provided in standard condition. Replacement lower-income dwelling units may include units that have been raised to standard from substandard condition if:</P>
            <P>(i) No person was displaced from the unit (see definition of “displaced person” in § 42.305); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The unit was vacant for at least 3 months before execution of the agreement between the recipient and the property owner.</P>
            <P>(4) The units must initially be made available for occupancy at any time during the period beginning 1 year before the recipient makes public the information required under paragraph (d) of this section and ending 3 years after the commencement of the demolition or rehabilitation related to the conversion.</P>
            <P>(5) The units must be designed to remain lower-income dwelling units for at least 10 years from the date of initial occupancy. Replacement lower-income dwelling units may include, but are not limited to, public housing or existing housing receiving Section 8 project-based assistance.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Preliminary information to be made public.</E> Before the recipient enters into a contract committing it to provide funds under programs covered by this subpart for any activity that will directly result in the demolition of lower-income dwelling units or the conversion of lower-income dwelling units to another use, the recipient must make public, and submit in writing to the HUD field office (or State, in the case of a unit of general local government funded by the State), the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) A description of the proposed assisted activity;</P>
            <P>(2) The location on a map and number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be demolished or converted to a use other than for lower-income dwelling units as a direct result of the assisted activity;</P>
            <P>(3) A time schedule for the commencement and completion of the demolition or conversion;</P>
            <P>(4) The location on a map and the number of dwelling units by size (number of bedrooms) that will be provided as replacement dwelling units. If such data are not available at the time of the general submission, the submission shall identify the general location on an area map and the approximate number of dwelling units by size, and information identifying the specific location and number of dwelling units by size shall be submitted and disclosed to the public as soon as it is available;</P>
            <P>(5) The source of funding and a time schedule for the provision of replacement dwelling units;</P>

            <P>(6) The basis for concluding that each replacement dwelling unit will remain a lower-income dwelling unit for at least 10 years from the date of initial occupancy; and<PRTPAGE P="343"/>
            </P>
            <P>(7) Information demonstrating that any proposed replacement of dwelling units with smaller dwelling units (e.g., a 2-bedroom unit with two 1-bedroom units) is consistent with the needs assessment contained in its HUD-approved consolidated plan. A unit of general local government funded by the State that is not required to submit a consolidated plan to HUD must make public information demonstrating that the proposed replacement is consistent with the housing needs of lower-income households in the jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Replacement not required.</E> (1) In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 5304(d)(3), the one-for-one replacement requirement of this section does not apply to the extent the HUD field office determines, based upon objective data, that there is an adequate supply of vacant lower-income dwelling units in standard condition available on a nondiscriminatory basis within the area.</P>
            <P>(2) The recipient must submit directly to the HUD field office the request for determination that the one-for-one replacement requirement does not apply. Simultaneously with the submission of the request, the recipient must make the submission public and inform interested persons that they have 30 days from the date of submission to provide to HUD additional information supporting or opposing the request.</P>
            <P>(3) A unit of general local government funded by the State must submit the request for determination under this paragraph to the State. Simultaneously with the submission of the request, the unit of general local government must make the submission public and inform interested persons that they have 30 days from the date of submission to provide to the State additional information supporting or opposing the request. If the State, after considering the submission and the additional data, agrees with the request, the State must provide its recommendation with supporting information to the field office.</P>

            <P>A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or with the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient. A person who is dissatisfied with the recipient's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office (or to the State in the case of a unit of general local government funded by the State). If the full relief is not granted, the recipient shall advise the person of his or her right to seek judicial review.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose, authority, and applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This part implements the policies of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other environmental requirements (as specified in § 50.4).</P>
            <P>(b) NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), establishes national policy, goals and procedures for protecting, restoring and enhancing environmental quality. NEPA is implemented by Executive Order 11514 of March 5, 1970, (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 902) as amended by Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977, (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 123) and by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.</P>
            <P>(c) The regulations issued by CEQ at 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 establish the basic procedural requirements for compliance with NEPA. These procedures are to be followed by all Federal agencies and are incorporated by reference into this part. This part, therefore, provides supplemental instructions to reflect the particular nature of HUD programs, and is to be used in tandem with 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 and regulations that implement authorities cited at § 50.4.</P>
            <P>(d) These regulations apply to all HUD policy actions (as defined in § 50.16), and to all HUD project actions (see § 50.2(a)(2)). Also, they apply to projects and activities carried out by recipients subject to environmental policy and procedures of 24 CFR part 58, when the recipient that is regulated under 24 CFR part 58 claims the lack of legal capacity to assume the Secretary's environmental review responsibilities and the claim is approved by HUD or when HUD determines to conduct an environmental review itself in place of a nonrecipient responsible entity. For programs, activities or actions not specifically identified or when there are questions regarding the applicability of this part, the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development shall be consulted.</P>

            <P>(f) HUD offices shall begin the environmental review process at the earliest possible time so that potential conflicts between program procedures and environmental requirements are identified at an early stage.</P>
            <P>(g) Applicants for HUD assistance shall be advised of environmental requirements and consultation with governmental agencies and individuals shall take place at the earliest time feasible.</P>

            <P>(2) Carry out mitigating measures required by HUD or select alternate eligible property; and</P>
            <P>(3) Not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair or construct property, nor commit or expend HUD or local funds for these program activities with respect to any eligible property, until HUD approval of the property is received.</P>
            <P>(i)(1) It is HUD policy that all property proposed for use in HUD programs be free of hazardous materials, contamination, toxic chemicals and gasses, and radioactive substances, where a hazard could affect the health and safety of occupants or conflict with the intended utilization of the property.</P>
            <P>(2) HUD environmental review of multifamily and non-residential properties shall include evaluation of previous uses of the site and other evidence of contamination on or near the site, to assure that occupants of proposed sites are not adversely affected by the hazards listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Particular attention should be given to any proposed site on or in the general proximity of such areas as dumps, landfills, industrial sites or other locations that contain hazardous wastes.</P>

            </P>
            <P>(b) A proposal may be accepted with modifications provided that:</P>
            <P>(1) Changes have been made that would reduce adverse environmental impact to acceptable and insignificant levels; and</P>
            <P>(2) An Environmental Management and Monitoring Program is developed in accordance with § 50.22 when it is deemed necessary by the HUD approving official.</P>
            <P>(c) A proposal should be rejected if significant and unavoidable adverse environmental impacts would still exist after modifications have been made to the proposal and an EIS is not prepared.</P>
            <P>(d) A proposal (if not rejected) shall require an EIS if the EA indicates that significant environmental impacts would result.</P>

            <P>(a) Under the circumstances described in this section, the FONSI must be made available for public review for 30 calendar days before a final decision is made whether to prepare an EIS and before the HUD action is taken. The circumstances are:</P>
            <P>(1) When the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of an EIS pursuant to § 50.42(b) but it is determined, as a result of an EA or in the course of preparation of a draft EIS, that the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the human environment; or</P>
            <P>(2) When the nature of the proposed action is without precedent and does not appear to require more than an assessment.</P>
            <P>(b) In such cases, the FONSI must be concurred in by the AS/CPD and the Program Environmental Clearance Officer. Notice of the availability of the FONSI shall be given to the public in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (d) of § 50.23.</P>

            <P>The environmental review must be re-evaluated and updated when the basis for the original environmental or compliance findings is affected by a major change requiring HUD approval in the nature, magnitude or extent of a project and the project is not yet complete. A change only in the amount of financing or mortgage insurance involved does not normally require the environmental review to be re-evaluated or updated.</P>

            <P>(a) An EIS is required if the proposal is determined to have a significant impact on the human environment pursuant to subpart E.</P>
            <P>(b) An EIS will normally be required if the proposal:</P>
            <P>(1) Would provide a site or sites for hospitals or nursing homes containing a total of 2,500 or more beds; or</P>
            <P>(2) Would remove, demolish, convert, or substantially rehabilitate 2,500 or more existing housing units (but not including rehabilitation projects categorically excluded under § 50.20), or which would result in the construction or installation of 2,500 or more housing units, or which would provide sites for 2,500 or more housing units.</P>
            <P>(c) When the environmental concerns of one or more Federal authorities cited in § 50.4 will be affected by the proposal, the cumulative impact of all such effects should be assessed to determine whether an EIS is required. Where all of the affected authorities provide alternative procedures for resolution, those procedures should be used in lieu of an EIS.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) It is HUD's general policy to provide minimum national standards applicable to HUD programs to protect citizens against excessive noise in their communities and places of residence.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Planning assistance.</E> HUD requires that grantees give adequate consideration to noise exposures and sources of noise as an integral part of the urban environment when HUD assistance is provided for planning purposes, as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) Particular emphasis shall be placed on the importance of compatible land use planning in relation to airports, highways and other sources of high noise.</P>
            <P>(ii) Applicants shall take into consideration HUD environmental standards impacting the use of land.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Activities subject to 24 CFR part 58.</E> (i) Responsible entities under 24 CFR part 58 must take into consideration the noise criteria and standards in the environmental review process and consider ameliorative actions when noise sensitive land development is proposed in noise exposed areas. Responsible entities shall address deviations from the standards in their environmental reviews as required in 24 CFR part 58.</P>
            <P>(ii) Where activities are planned in a noisy area, and HUD assistance is contemplated later for housing and/or other noise sensitive activities, the responsible entity risks denial of the HUD assistance unless the HUD standards are met.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">HUD support for new construction.</E> HUD assistance for the construction of new noise sensitive uses is prohibited generally for projects with unacceptable noise exposures and is discouraged for projects with normally unacceptable noise exposure. (Standards of acceptability are contained in § 51.103(c).) This policy applies to all HUD programs providing assistance, subsidy or insurance for housing, manufactured home parks, nursing homes, hospitals, and all programs providing assistance or insurance for land development, redevelopment or any other provision of facilities and services which are directed to making land available for housing or noise sensitive development. The policy does not apply to research demonstration projects which do not result in new construction or reconstruction, flood insurance, interstate land sales egistration, or any action or emergency assistance under disaster assistance provisions or appropriations which are provided to save lives, protect property, protect public health and safety, remove debris and wreckage, or assistance that has the effect of restoring facilities substantially as they existed prior to the disaster.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">HUD support for existing construction.</E> Noise exposure by itself will not result in the denial of HUD support for the resale and purchase of otherwise acceptable existing buildings. However, environmental noise is a marketability factor which HUD will consider in determining the amount of insurance or other assistance that may be given.<PRTPAGE P="355"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">HUD support of modernization and rehabilitation.</E> For modernization projects located in all noise exposed areas, HUD shall encourage noise attenuation features in alterations. For major or substantial rehabilitation projects in the Normally Unacceptable and Unacceptable noise zones, HUD actively shall seek to have project sponsors incorporate noise attenuation features, given the extent and nature of the rehabilitation being undertaken and the level or exterior noise exposure. In Unacceptable noise zones, HUD shall strongly encourage conversion of noise-exposed sites to land uses compatible with the high noise levels.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Research, guidance and publications.</E> HUD shall maintain a continuing program designed to provide new knowledge of noise abatement and control to public and private bodies, to develop improved methods for anticipating noise encroachment, to develop noise abatement measures through land use and building construction practices, and to foster better understanding of the consequences of noise. It shall be HUD's policy to issue guidance documents periodically to assist HUD personnel in assigning an acceptability category to projects in accordance with noise exposure standards, in evaluating noise attenuation measures, and in advising local agencies about noise abatement strategies. The guidance documents shall be updated periodically in accordance with advances in the state-of-the-art.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Construction equipment, building equipment and appliances.</E> HUD shall encourage the use of quieter construction equipment and methods in population centers, the use of quieter equipment and appliances in buildings, and the use of appropriate noise abatement techniques in the design of residential structures with potential noise problems.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Exterior noise goals.</E> It is a HUD goal that exterior noise levels do not exceed a day-night average sound level of 55 decibels. This level is recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency as a goal for outdoors in residential areas. The levels recommended by EPA are not standards and do not take into account cost or feasibility. For the purposes of this regulation and to meet other program objectives, sites with a day-night average sound level of 65 and below are acceptable and are allowable (see Standards in § 51.103(c)).</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Interior noise goals.</E> It is a HUD goal that the interior auditory environment shall not exceed a day-night average sound level of 45 decibels. Attenuation measures to meet these interior goals shall be employed where feasible. Emphasis shall be given to noise sensitive interior spaces such as bedrooms. Minimum attenuation requirements are prescribed in § 51.104(a).</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Acoustical privacy in multifamily buildings.</E> HUD shall require the use of building design and acoustical treatment to afford acoustical privacy in multifamily buildings pursuant to requirements of the Minimum Property Standards.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Measure of external noise environments.</E> The magnitude of the external noise environment at a site is determined by the value of the day-night average sound level produced as the result of the accumulation of noise from all sources contributing to the external noise environment at the site. Day-night average sound level, abbreviated as DNL and symbolized as L<E T="52">dn</E>, is the 24-hour average sound level, in decibels, obtained after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. Mathematical expressions for average sound level and day-night average sound level are stated in the Appendix I to this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Loud impulsive sounds.</E> On an interim basis, when loud impulsive sounds, such as explosions or sonic booms, are experienced at a site, the day-night average sound level produced by the loud impulsive sounds alone shall have 8 decibels added to it in assessing the acceptability of the site (see appendix I to this subpart). Alternatively, the C-weighted day-night average sound level (L<E T="52">Cdn</E>) may be used without the 8 decibel addition, as indicated in § 51.106(a)(3). Methods for assessing the contribution of loud impulsive sounds to day-night average sound level at a site and mathematical expressions for determining whether a sound is classed as “loud impulsive” are provided in the appendix I to this subpart.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Exterior standards.</E> (1) The degree of acceptability of the noise environment at a site is determined by the sound levels external to buildings or other facilities containing noise sensitive uses. The standards shall usually apply at a location 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the building housing noise sensitive activities in the direction of the predominant noise source. Where the building location is undetermined, the standards shall apply 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the building setback line nearest to the predominant noise source. The standards shall also apply at other locations where it is determined that quiet outdoor space is required in an area ancillary to the principal use on the site.</P>
            <P>(2) The noise environment inside a building is considered acceptable if: (i) The noise environment external to the building complies with these standards, and (ii) the building is constructed in a manner common to the area or, if of uncommon construction, has at least the equivalent noise attenuation characteristics.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) <E T="03">Noise attenuation.</E> Noise attenuation measures are those required in addition to attenuation provided by buildings as commonly constructed in the area, and requiring open windows for ventilation. Measures that reduce external noise at a site shall be used wherever practicable in preference to the incorporation of additional noise attenuation in buildings. Building designs and construction techniques that provide more noise attenuation than typical construction may be employed also to meet the noise attenuation requirements.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Normally unacceptable noise zones and unacceptable noise zones.</E> Approvals in Normally Unacceptable Noise Zones require a minimum of 5 decibels additional sound attenuation for buildings having noise-sensitive uses if the day-night average sound level is greater than 65 decibels but does not exceed 70 decibels, or a minimum of 10 decibels of additional sound attenuation if the day-night average sound level is greater than 70 decibels but does not exceed 75 decibels. Noise attenuation measures in Unacceptable Noise Zones require the approval of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, or the Certifying Officer for activities subject to 24 CFR part 58. (See § 51.104(b)(2).)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental review requirements.</E> Environmental reviews shall be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 24 CFR parts 50 and 58, as applicable, or other environmental regulations issued by the Department. These requirements are hereby modified for all projects proposed in the Normally Unacceptable and Unacceptable noise exposure zones as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Normally unacceptable noise zone.</E> (i) All projects located in the Normally Unacceptable Noise Zone require a Special Environmental Clearance except an EIS is required for a proposed project located in a largely undeveloped area, or where the HUD action is likely to encourage the establishment of incompatible land use in this noise zone.</P>
            <P>(ii) When an EIS is required, the concurrence of the Program Assistant Secretary is also required before a project can be approved. For the purposes of this paragraph, an area will be considered as largely undeveloped unless the area within a 2-mile radius of the project boundary is more than 50 percent developed for urban uses and infrastructure (particularly water and sewers) is available and has capacity to serve the project.</P>
            <P>(iii) All other projects in the Normally Unacceptable zone require a Special Environmental Clearance, except where an EIS is required for other reasons pursuant to HUD environmental policies.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Unacceptable noise zone.</E> An EIS is required prior to the approval of projects with unacceptable noise exposure. Projects in or partially in an Unacceptable Noise Zone shall be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, or the Certifying Officer for activities subject to 24 CFR part 58, for approval. The Assistant Secretary or the Certifying Officer may waive the EIS requirement in cases where noise is the only environmental issue and no outdoor noise sensitive activity will take place on the site. In such cases, an environmental review shall be made pursuant to the requirements of 24 CFR parts 50 or 58, as appropriate.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Flexibility for non-acoustic benefits.</E> Where it is determined that program objectives cannot be achieved on sites meeting the acceptability standard of 65 decibels, the Acceptable Zone may be shifted to L<E T="52">dn</E> 70 on a case-by-case basis if all the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) The project does not require an Environmental Impact Statement under provisions of § 51.104(b)(1) and noise is the only environmental issue.</P>
            <P>(2) The project has received a Special Environmental Clearance and has received the concurrence of the Environmental Clearance Officer.</P>
            <P>(3) The project meets other program goals to provide housing in proximity to employment, public facilities and transportation.</P>

            <P>(4) The project is in conformance with local goals and maintains the character of the neighborhood.<PRTPAGE P="358"/>
            </P>

            <P>(5) The project sponsor has set forth reasons, acceptable to HUD, as to why the noise attenuation measures that would normally be required for new construction in the L<E T="52">dn</E> 65 to L<E T="52">dn</E> 70 zone cannot be met.</P>
            <P>(6) Other sites which are not exposed to noise above L<E T="52">dn</E> 65 and which meet program objectives are generally not available.</P>
            <FP>The above factors shall be documented and made part of the project file.</FP>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of available data.</E> HUD field staff shall make maximum use of noise data prepared by others when such data are determined to be current and adequately projected into the future and are in terms of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Sites in the vicinity of airports.</E> The noise environment around airports is described sometimes in terms of Noise Exposure Forecasts, abbreviated as NEF or, in the State of California, as Community Noise Equivalent Level, abbreviated as CNEL. The noise environment for sites in the vicinity of airports for which day-night average sound level data are not available may be evaluated from NEF or CNEL analyses using the following conversions to DNL:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Sites in the vicinity of highways.</E> Highway projects receiving Federal aid are subject to noise analyses under the procedures of the Federal Highway Administration. Where such analyses are available they may be used to assess sites subject to the requirements of this standard. The Federal Highway Administration employs two alternate sound level descriptors: (i) The A-weighted sound level not exceeded more than 10 percent of the time for the highway design hour traffic flow, symbolized as L<E T="52">10</E>; or (ii) the equivalent sound level for the design hour, symbolized as L<E T="52">eq</E>. The day-night average sound level may be estimated from the design hour L<E T="52">10</E> or L<E T="52">eq</E> values by the following relationships, provided heavy trucks do not exceed 10 percent of the total traffic flow in vehicles per 24 hours and the traffic flow between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. does not exceed 15 percent of the average daily traffic flow in vehicles per 24 hours:

            </EXTRACT>
            
            <FP>Where the auto/truck mix and time of day relationships as stated in this section do not exist, the HUD Noise Assessment Guidelines or other noise analysis shall be used.</FP>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Sites in the vicinity of installations producing loud impulsive sounds.</E> Certain Department of Defense installations produce loud impulsive sounds from artillery firing and bombing practice ranges. Noise analyses for these facilities sometimes encompass sites that may be subject to the requirements of this standard. Where such analyses are available they may be used on an interim basis to establish the acceptability of sites under this standard. The Department of Defense uses day-night average sound level based on C-weighted sound level, symbolized L<E T="52">Cdn</E>, for the analysis of loud impulsive sounds. Where such analyses are provided, the 8 decibel addition specified in § 51.103(b), is not required, and the same numerical values of day-night average sound level used on an interim basis to determine site suitability for non-impulsive sounds apply to the L<E T="52">Cdn</E>.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Use of areawide acoustical data.</E> HUD encourages the preparation and use of areawide acoustical information, such as noise contours for airports. Where such new or revised contours become available for airports (civil or military) and military installations they shall first be referred to the HUD State Office (Environmental Officer) for review, evaluation and decision on appropriateness for use by HUD. The HUD State Office shall submit revised contours to the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development for review, evaluation and decision whenever the area affected is changed by 20 percent or more, or whenever it is determined that the new contours will have a significant effect on HUD programs, or whenever the contours are not provided in a methodology acceptable under § 51.106(a)(1) or in other cases where the HUD State Office determines that Headquarters review is <PRTPAGE P="359"/>warranted. For other areawide acoustical data, review is required only where existing areawide data are being utilized and where such data have been changed to reflect changes in the measurement methodology or underlying noise source assumptions. Requests for determination on usage of new or revised areawide data shall include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Maps showing old, if applicable, and new noise contours, along with brief description of data source and methodology.</P>
            <P>(ii) Impact on existing and prospective urbanized areas and on development activity.</P>
            <P>(iii) Impact on HUD-assisted projects currently in processing.</P>
            <P>(iv) Impact on future HUD program activity. Where a field office has determined that immediate approval of new areawide data is necessary and warranted in limited geographic areas, the request for approval should state the circumstances warranting such approval. Actions on proposed projects shall not be undertaken while new areawide noise data are being considered for HUD use except where the proposed location is affected in the same manner under both the old and new noise data.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Site assessments.</E> Compliance with the standards contained in § 51.103(c) shall, where necessary, be determined using noise assessment guidelines, handbooks, technical documents and procedures issued by the Department.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Variations in site noise levels.</E> In many instances the noise environment will vary across a site, with portions of the site being in an Acceptable noise environment and other portions in a Normally Unacceptable noise environment. The standards in § 51.103(c) shall apply to the portions of a building or buildings used for residential purposes and for ancillary noise sensitive open spaces.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Noise measurements.</E> Where noise assessments result in a finding that the site is borderline or questionable, or is controversial, noise measurements may be performed. Where it is determined that noise measurements are required, such measurements will be conducted in accordance with methods and measurement criteria established by the Department. Locations for noise measurements will depend on the location of noise sensitive uses that are nearest to the predominant noise source (see § 51.103(c)).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Projections of noise exposure.</E> In addition to assessing existing exposure, future conditions should be projected. To the extent possible, noise exposure shall be projected to be representative of conditions that are expected to exist at a time at least 10 years beyond the date of the project or action under review.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Reduction of site noise by use of berms and/or barriers.</E> If it is determined by adequate analysis that a berm and/or barrier will reduce noise at a housing site, and if the barrier is existing or there are assurances that it will be in place prior to occupancy, the environmental noise analysis for the site may reflect the benefits afforded by the berm and/or barrier. In the environmental review process under § 51.104(b), the location height and design of the berm and/or barrier shall be evaluated to determine its effectiveness, and impact on design and aesthetic quality, circulation and other environmental factors.</P>

            <P>1. <E T="03">Sound Level.</E> The quantity in decibels measured with an instrument satisfying requirements of American National Standard Specification for Type 1 Sound Level Meters S1.4-1971. Fast time-averaging and A-frequency weighting are to be used, unless others are specified. The sound level meter with the A-weighting is progressively less sensitive to sounds of frequency below 1,000 hertz (cycles per second), somewhat as is the ear. With fast time averaging the sound level meter responds particularly to recent sounds almost as quickly as does the ear in judging the loudness of a sound.</P>
            <P>2. <E T="03">Average Sound Level.</E> Average sound level, in decibels, is the level of the mean-square A-weighted sound pressure during the stated time period, with reference to the square of the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals.</P>

            <P>Day-night average sound level, abbreviated as DNL, and symbolized mathematically as L<E T="52">dn</E> is defined as:</P>

            <P>Time t is in seconds, so the limits shown in hours and minutes are actually interpreted in seconds. L<E T="52">A</E>(t) is the time varying value of A-weighted sound level, the quantity in decibels measured by an instrument satisfying requirements of American National Standard Specification for Type 1 Sound Level Meters S1.4-1971.</P>
            <P>3. <E T="03">Loud Impulsive Sounds.</E> When loud impulsive sounds such as sonic booms or explosions are anticipated contributors to the noise environment at a site, the contribution to day-night average sound level produced by the loud impulsive sounds shall have 8 decibels added to it in assessing the acceptability of a site.</P>
            <P>A loud impulsive sound is defined for the purpose of this regulation as one for which:</P>
            <P>(i) The sound is definable as a discrete event wherein the sound level increases to a maximum and then decreases in a total time interval of approximately one second or less to the ambient background level that exists without the sound; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The maximum sound level (obtained with slow averaging time and A-weighting of a Type 1 sound level meter whose characteristics comply with ANSI S1.4-1971) exceeds the sound level prior to the onset of the event by at least 6 decibels; and</P>
            <P>(iii) The maximum sound level obtained with fast averaging time of a sound level meter exceeds the maximum value obtained with slow averaging time by at least 4 decibels.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Background Information Concerning the Standards</HD>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Thermal Radiation:</E>
            </P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> Flammable products stored in above ground containers represent a definite, potential threat to human life and structures in the event of fire. The resulting fireball emits thermal radiation which is absorbed by the surroundings. Combustible structures, such as wooden houses, may be ignited by the thermal radiation being emitted. The radiation can cause severe burn, injuries and even death to exposed persons some distance away from the site of the fire.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Criteria for Acceptable Separation Distance (ASD).</E> Wooden buildings, window drapes and trees generally ignite spontaneously when exposed for a relatively long period of time to thermal radiation levels of approximately 10,000 Btu/hr. sq. ft. It will take 15 to 20 minutes for a building to ignite at that degree of thermal intensity. Since the reasonable response time for fire fighting units in urbanized areas is approximately five to ten minutes, a standard of 10,000 BTU/hr. sq. ft. is considered an acceptable level of thermal radiation for buildings.</P>
            <P>People in outdoor areas exposed to a thermal radiation flux level of approximately 1,500 Btu/ft<SU>2</SU> hr will suffer intolerable pain after 15 seconds. Longer exposure causes blistering, permanent skin damage, and even death. Since it is assumed that children and the elderly could not take refuge behind walls or run away from the thermal effect of the fire within the 15 seconds before skin blistering occurs, unprotected (outdoor) areas, such as playgrounds, parks, yards, school grounds, etc., must be placed at such a distance from potential fire locations so that the radiation flux level is well below 1500 Btu/ft<SU>2</SU> hr. An acceptable flux level, particularly for elderly people and children, is 450 Btu/ft<SU>2</SU> hr. The skin can be exposed to this degree of thermal radiation for 3 minutes or longer with no serious detrimental effect. The result would be the same as a bad sunburn. Therefore, the standard for areas in which there will be exposed people, e.g. outdoor recreation areas such as playgrounds and parks, is set at 450 Btu/hr. sq. ft. Areas covered also include open space ancillary to residential structures, such as yard areas and vehicle parking areas.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Acceptable Separation Distance From a Potential Fire Hazard.</E> This is the actual setback required for the safety of occupied buildings and their inhabitants, and people in open spaces (exposed areas) from a potential fire hazard. The specific distance required for safety from such a hazard depends upon the nature and the volume of the substance. The Technical Guidebook entitled “Urban Development Siting With Respect to Hazardous/Commercial Industrial Facilities,” which supplements this regulation, contains the technical guidance required to compute Acceptable Separation Distances (ASD) for those flammable substances most often encountered.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Blast Overpressure:</E> The Acceptable Separation Distance (ASD) for people and structures from materials prone to explosion is dependent upon the resultant blast measured in pounds per square inch (psi) overpressure. It has been determined by the military and corroborated by two independent studies conducted for the Department of Housing and Urban Development that 0.5 psi is the acceptable level of blast overpressure for both buildings and occupants, because a frame structure can normally withstand that level of external exertion with no serious structural damage, and it is unlikely that human beings inside the building would normally suffer any serious injury. Using this as the safety standard for blast overpressure, nomographs have been developed from which <PRTPAGE P="364"/>an ASD can be determined for a given quantify of hazardous substance. These nomographs are contained in the handbook with detailed instructions on their use.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Hazard evaluation:</E> The Acceptable Separation Distances for buildings, which are determined for thermal radiation and blast overpressure, delineate separate identifiable danger zones for each potential accident source. For some materials the fire danger zone will have the greatest radius and cover the largest area, while for others the explosion danger zone will be the greatest. For example, conventional petroleum fuel products stored in unpressurized tanks do not emit blast overpressure of dangerous levels when ignited. In most cases, hazardous substances will be stored in pressurized containers. The resulting blast overpressure will be experienced at a greater distance than the resulting thermal radiation for the standards set in Section 51.203. In any event the hazard requiring the greatest separation distance will prevail in determining the location of HUD-assisted projects.</P>
            <P>The standards developed for the protection of people and property are given in the following table.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HD2">Problem Example</HD>
            <P>The following example is given as a guide to assist in understanding how the procedures are used to determine an acceptable separation distance. The technical data are found in the HUD Guidebook. Liquid propane is used in the example since it is both an explosion and a fire hazard.</P>
            <P>In this hypothetical case a proposed housing project is to be located 850 feet from a 30,000 gallon liquid propane (LPG) tank. The objective is to determine the acceptable separation distance from the LPG tank. Since propane is both explosive and fire prone it will be necessary to determine the ASD for both explosion and for fire. The greatest of the two will govern. There is no dike around the tank in this example.</P>
            <P>Nomographs from the technical Guidebook have been reproduced to facilitate the solving of the problem.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">ASD For Explosion</HD>
            <P>Use Figure 1 to determine the acceptable separation distance for explosion.</P>
            <P>The graph depicted on Figure 1 is predicated on a blast overpressure of 0.5 psi.</P>
            <P>The ASD in feet can be determined by applying the quantity of the hazard (in gallons) to the graph.</P>
            <P>In this case locate the 30,000 gallon point on the horizontal axis and draw a vertical line from that point to the intersection with the straight line curve. Then draw a horizontal line from the point where the lines cross to the left vertical axis where the ACCEPTABLE SEPARATION DISTANCE of 660 feet is found.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Therefore the ASD for explosion is 660 feet</E>
            </P>
            <P>Since the proposed project site is located 850 feet from the tank it is located at a safe distance with regards to blast overpressure.</P>

            </GPH>
            <HD SOURCE="HD2">ASD For Fire</HD>
            <P>To determine the ASD for fire it will be necessary to first find the fire width (diameter of the fireball) on Figure 2. Then apply this to Figure 3 to determine the ASD.</P>
            <P>Since there are two safety standards for fire: (a) 10,000 BTU/ft<SU>2</SU> hr. for buildings; and (b) 450 BTU/ft<SU>2</SU> hr. for people in exposed areas, it will be necessary to determine an ASD for each.</P>

            <P>To determine the fire width locate the 30,000 gallon point on the horizontal axis on <E T="03">Figure 2</E> and draw a vertical line to the straight line curve. Then draw a horizontal line from the point where the lines cross to the left vertical axis where the FIRE WIDTH is found to be <E T="03">350 feet.</E>
              <PRTPAGE P="366"/>
            </P>
            <P>Now locate the 350 ft. point on the horizontal axis of <E T="03">Figure 3</E> and draw a vertical line from that point to curves 1 and 2. Then draw horizontal lines from the points where the lines cross to the left vertical axis where the ACCEPTABLE SEPARATION DISTANCES of <E T="03">240 feet</E> for buildings and <E T="03">1,150 feet</E> for exposure to people is found.</P>

            <P>Based on this the proposed project site is located at a safe distance from a potential fireball. However, exposed playgrounds or other exposed areas of congregation must be at least 1,150 feet from the tank, or be appropriately shielded from a potential fireball.

            <P>(1) Changes the use of the facility so that it becomes one which is no longer acceptable in accordance with the standards contained in § 51.303(b);</P>
            <P>(2) Significantly increases the density or number of people at the site; or</P>
            <P>(3) Introduces explosive, flammable or toxic materials to the area.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as noted in § 51.303(a)(3), these policies do not apply to HUD programs where the action only involves the purchase, sale or rental of an existing property without significantly prolonging the physical or economic life of the property.</P>
            <P>(d) The policies do not apply to research or demonstration projects which do not result in new construction or reconstruction, to interstate land sales registration, or to any action or emergency assistance which is provided to save lives, protect property, protect public health and safety, or remove debris and wreckage.</P>

            <P>(2) If a project proposed for HUD assistance, subsidy or insurance is one which will not be frequently used or occupied by people, HUD policy is to provide assistance, subsidy or insurance only when written assurances are provided to HUD by the airport operator to the effect that there are no plans to purchase the land involved with such facilities as part of a Runway Clear Zone or Clear Zone acquisition program.</P>
            <P>(3) Special notification requirements for Runway Clear Zones and Clear Zones. In all cases involving HUD assistance, subsidy, or insurance for the purchase or sale of an existing property in a Runway Clear Zone or Clear Zone, HUD (or the responsible entity or recipient under 24 CFR part 58) shall advise the buyer that the property is in a Runway Clear Zone or Clear Zone, what the implications of such a location are, and that there is a possibility that the property may, at a later date, be acquired by the airport operator. The buyer must sign a statement acknowledging receipt of this information.</P>

            <P>(b) HUD policy for actions in Accident Potential Zones at Military Airfields. HUD policy is to discourage the provision of any assistance, subsidy or insurance for projects and actions in the Accident Potential Zones. To be approved, projects must be generally consistent with the recommendations in the <E T="03">Land Use Compatibility Guidelines For Accident Potential Zones</E> chart contained in DOD Instruction 4165.57, 32 CFR part 256.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose and basic responsibility.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) The purpose of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, is “to avoid to the extent possible the long and short-term adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative.”</P>

            <P>(2) The purpose of Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, is “to avoid to the extent possible the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands and to avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative.”<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) This part implements the requirements of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, and Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands, and employs the principles of the Unified National Program for Floodplain Management. These regulations apply to all HUD (or responsible entity) actions that are subject to potential harm by location in floodplains or wetlands. Covered actions include the proposed acquisition, construction, demolition, improvement, disposition, financing, and use of properties located in floodplains or wetlands for which approval is required either from HUD, under any applicable HUD program, or from a responsible entity authorized by 24 CFR part 58.</P>
            <P>(4) This part does not prohibit approval of such actions (except for certain actions in Coastal High Hazard Areas), but provides a consistent means for implementing the Department's interpretation of the Executive Orders in the project approval decisionmaking processes of HUD and of responsible entities subject to 24 CFR part 58. The implementation of Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 under this part shall be conducted by HUD for Department-administered programs subject to environmental review under 24 CFR part 50 and by authorized responsible entities that are responsible for environmental review under 24 CFR part 58.</P>
            <P>(5) Nonstructural alternatives to floodplain development and the destruction of wetlands are both favored and encouraged to reduce the loss of life and property caused by floods, and to restore the natural resources and functions of floodplains and wetlands. Nonstructural alternatives should be discussed in the decisionmaking process where practicable.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Under section 202(a) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4106(a), proposed HUD financial assistance (including mortgage insurance) for acquisition or construction purposes in any “area having special flood hazards” (a flood zone designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)) shall not be approved in communities identified by FEMA as eligible for flood insurance but which are not participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. This prohibition only applies to proposed HUD financial assistance in a FEMA-designated area of special flood hazard one year after the community has been formally notified by FEMA of the designation of the affected area. This prohibition is not applicable to HUD financial assistance in the form of formula grants to states, including financial assistance under the State-administered CDBG Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart I) and the State-administered Rental Rehabilitation Program (24 CFR 511.51), Emergency Shelter Grant amounts allocated to States (24 CFR parts 575 and 576), and HOME funds provided to a state under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12701-12839).</P>
            <P>(2) Under section 582 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 5154a), HUD disaster assistance that is made available in a special flood hazard area may not be used to make a payment (including any loan assistance payment) to a person for repair, replacement, or restoration of damage to any personal, residential, or commercial property if:</P>
            <P>(i) The person had previously received Federal flood disaster assistance conditioned on obtaining and maintaining flood insurance; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The person failed to obtain and maintain the flood insurance.</P>
            <P>(c) Except with respect to actions listed in § 55.12(c), no HUD financial assistance (including mortgage insurance) may be approved after May 23, 1994 with respect to:</P>
            <P>(1) Any action other than a functionally dependent use or floodplain function restoration activity, located in a floodway;</P>
            <P>(2) Any critical action located in a coastal high hazard area; or</P>

            <P>(3) Any noncritical action located in a Coastal High Hazard Area, unless the action is a functionally dependent use, existing construction (including improvements), or reconstruction following destruction caused by a disaster. If the action is not a functionally dependent use, the action must be designed for location in a Coastal High <PRTPAGE P="375"/>Hazard Area. An action will be considered designed for a Coastal High Hazard Area if:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of reconstruction following destruction caused by a disaster or substantial improvement, the work meets the current standards for V zones in FEMA regulations (44 CFR 60.3(e)) and, if applicable, the Minimum Property Standards for such construction in 24 CFR 200.926d(c)(4)(iii); or</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of existing construction (including any minor improvements):</P>
            <P>(A) The work met FEMA elevation and construction standards for a coastal high hazard area (or if such a zone or such standards were not designated, the 100-year floodplain) applicable at the time the original improvements were constructed; or</P>
            <P>(B) If the original improvements were constructed before FEMA standards for the 100-year floodplain became effective or before FEMA designated the location of the action as within the 100-year floodplain, the work would meet at least the earliest FEMA standards for construction in the 100-year floodplain.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 55.2</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Terminology.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) With the exception of those terms defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the terms used in this part shall follow the definitions contained in section 6 of Executive Order 11988, section 7 of Executive Order 11990, and the Floodplain Management Guidelines for Implementing Executive Order 11988 (43 FR 6030, February 10, 1978), issued by the Water Resources Council; the terms “special flood hazard area,” “criteria,” and “Regular Program” shall follow the definitions contained in FEMA regulations at 44 CFR 59.1; and the terms “Letter of Map Revision” and “Letter of Map Amendment” shall refer to letters issued by FEMA, as provided in 44 CFR part 65 and 44 CFR part 70, respectively.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Coastal high hazard area</E> means the area subject to high velocity waters, including but not limited to hurricane wave wash or tsunamis. The area is designated on a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Insurance Study (FIS) under FEMA regulations. FIRMs and FISs are also relied upon for the designation of “100-year floodplains” (§ 55.2(b)(9)), “500-year floodplains” (§ 55.2(b)(4)), and “floodways” (§ 55.2(b)(5)). When FEMA provides interim flood hazard data, such as Advisory Base Flood Elevations (ABFE) or preliminary maps and studies, HUD or the responsible entity shall use the latest of these sources. If FEMA information is unavailable or insufficiently detailed, other Federal, state, or local data may be used as “best available information” in accordance with Executive Order 11988. However, a base flood elevation from an interim or preliminary or non-FEMA source cannot be used if it is lower than the current FIRM and FIS.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Compensatory mitigation</E> means the restoration (reestablishment or rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or, in certain circumstances, preservation of aquatic resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts that remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization have been achieved.</P>
            <P>Examples include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Permittee-responsible mitigation:</E> On-site or off-site mitigation undertaken by the holder of a wetlands permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (or an authorized agent or contractor), for which the permittee retains full responsibility;</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Mitigation banking:</E> A permittee's purchase of credits from a wetlands mitigation bank, comprising wetlands that have been set aside to compensate for conversions of other wetlands; the mitigation obligation is transferred to the sponsor of the mitigation bank; and</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">In-lieu fee mitigation:</E> A permittee's provision of funds to an in-lieu fee sponsor (public agency or nonprofit organization) that builds and maintains a mitigation site, often after the permitted adverse wetland impacts have occurred; the mitigation obligation is transferred to the in-lieu fee sponsor.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Critical action</E> means any activity for which even a slight chance of <PRTPAGE P="376"/>flooding would be too great, because such flooding might result in loss of life, injury to persons, or damage to property. Critical actions include activities that create, maintain or extend the useful life of those structures or facilities that:</P>
            <P>(A) Produce, use or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic or water-reactive materials;</P>
            <P>(B) Provide essential and irreplaceable records or utility or emergency services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events (e.g., data storage centers, generating plants, principal utility lines, emergency operations centers including fire and police stations, and roadways providing sole egress from flood-prone areas); or</P>
            <P>(C) Are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury during flood or storm events, e.g., persons who reside in hospitals, nursing homes, convalescent homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care facilities, and retirement service centers. Housing for independent living for the elderly is not considered a critical action.</P>
            <P>(ii) Critical actions shall not be approved in floodways or coastal high hazard areas.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">500-year floodplain</E> means the minimum floodplain of concern for Critical Actions and is the area subject to inundation from a flood having a 0.2 percent chance of occurring in any given year. (See § 55.2(b)(1) for appropriate data sources.)</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Floodway</E> means that portion of the floodplain which is effective in carrying flow, where the flood hazard is generally the greatest, and where water depths and velocities are the highest. The term “floodway” as used here is consistent with “regulatory floodways” as identified by FEMA. (See § 55.2(b)(1) for appropriate data sources.)</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Functionally dependent use</E> means a land use that must necessarily be conducted in close proximity to water (e.g., a dam, marina, port facility, water-front park, and many types of bridges).</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">High hazard area</E> means a floodway or a coastal high hazard area.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">New construction</E> includes draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, and related activities and any structures or facilities begun after the effective date of Executive Order 11990. (See section 7(b) of Executive Order 11990.)</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">100-year floodplain</E> means the floodplain of concern for this part and is the area subject to inundation from a flood having a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. (See § 55.2(b)(1) for appropriate data sources.)</P>
            <P>(10)(i) <E T="03">Substantial improvement</E> means either:</P>
            <P>(A) Any repair, reconstruction, modernization or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Before the improvement or repair is started; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage occurred; or</P>
            <P>(B) Any repair, reconstruction, modernization or improvement of a structure that results in an increase of more than twenty percent in the number of dwelling units in a residential project or in the average peak number of customers and employees likely to be on-site at any one time for a commercial or industrial project.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Substantial improvement</E> may not be defined to include either:</P>
            <P>(A) Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications that is solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or</P>
            <P>(B) Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historical Places or on a State Inventory of Historic Places.</P>
            <P>(iii) Structural repairs, reconstruction, or improvements not meeting this definition are considered “minor improvements”.</P>
            <P>(11) <E T="03">Wetlands</E> means those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does or would support, a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally <PRTPAGE P="377"/>include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, potholes, wet meadows, river overflows, mud flats, and natural ponds. This definition includes those wetland areas separated from their natural supply of water as a result of activities such as the construction of structural flood protection methods or solid-fill road beds and activities such as mineral extraction and navigation improvements. This definition includes both wetlands subject to and those not subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act as well as constructed wetlands. The following process shall be followed in making the wetlands determination:</P>
            <P>(i) HUD or, for programs subject to 24 CFR part 58, the responsible entity, shall make a determination whether the action is new construction that is located in a wetland. These actions are subject to processing under the § 55.20 decisionmaking process for the protection of wetlands.</P>
            <P>(ii) As primary screening, HUD or the responsible entity shall verify whether the project area is located in proximity to wetlands identified on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). If so, HUD or the responsible entity should make a reasonable attempt to consult with the Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), for information concerning the location, boundaries, scale, and classification of wetlands within the area. If an NWI map indicates the presence of wetlands, FWS staff, if available, must find that no wetland is present in order for the action to proceed without further processing. Where FWS staff is unavailable to resolve any NWI map ambiguity or controversy, an appropriate wetlands professional must find that no wetland is present in order for the action to proceed without § 55.20 processing.</P>
            <P>(iii) As secondary screening used in conjunction with NWI maps, HUD or the responsible entity is encouraged to use the Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Soil Survey (NSS) and any state and local information concerning the location, boundaries, scale, and classification of wetlands within the action area.</P>
            <P>(iv) Any challenges from the public or other interested parties to the wetlands determinations made under this part must be made in writing to HUD (or the responsible entity authorized under 24 CFR part 58) during the commenting period and must be substantiated with verifiable scientific information. Commenters may request a reasonable extension of the time for the commenting period for the purpose of substantiating any objections with verifiable scientific information. HUD or the responsible entity shall consult FWS staff, if available, on the validity of the challenger's scientific information prior to making a final wetlands determination.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 55.20</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Decision making process.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Except for actions covered by § 55.12(a), the decisionmaking process for compliance with this part contains eight steps, including public notices and an examination of practicable alternatives when addressing floodplains and wetlands. The steps to be followed in the decisionmaking process are as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> Determine whether the proposed action is located in the 100-year floodplain (500-year floodplain for critical actions) or results in new construction in a wetland. If the action does not occur in a floodplain or result in new construction in a wetland, then no further compliance with this part is required. The following process shall be followed by HUD (or the responsible entity) in making wetland determinations.</P>
            <P>(1) Refer to § 55.28(a) where an applicant has submitted with its application to HUD (or to the recipient under programs subject to 24 CFR part 58) an individual Section 404 permit (including approval conditions and related environmental review).</P>
            <P>(2) Refer to § 55.2(b)(11) for making wetland determinations under this part.</P>
            <P>(3) For proposed actions occurring in both a wetland and a floodplain, completion of the decisionmaking process under § 55.20 is required regardless of the issuance of a Section 404 permit. In such a case, the wetland will be considered among the primary natural and beneficial functions and values of the floodplain.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> Notify the public and agencies responsible for floodplain management or wetlands protection at the earliest possible time of a proposal to consider an action in a 100-year floodplain (or a 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or wetland and involve the affected and interested public and agencies in the decisionmaking process.</P>
            <P>(1) The public notices required by paragraphs (b) and (g) of this section may be combined with other project notices wherever appropriate. Notices required under this part must be bilingual if the affected public is largely non-English speaking. In addition, all notices must be published in an appropriate local printed news medium, and must be sent to federal, state, and local public agencies, organizations, and, where not otherwise covered, individuals known to be interested in the proposed action.</P>

            <P>(2) A minimum of 15 calendar days shall be allowed for comment on the public notice.<PRTPAGE P="382"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) A notice under this paragraph shall state: The name, proposed location, and description of the activity; the total number of acres of floodplain or wetland involved; the related natural and beneficial functions and values of the floodplain or wetland that may be adversely affected by the proposed activity; the HUD approving official (or the Certifying Officer of the responsible entity authorized by 24 CFR part 58); and the phone number to call for information. The notice shall indicate the hours of HUD or the responsible entity's office, and any Web site at which a full description of the proposed action may be reviewed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> Identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to locating the proposed action in a 100-year floodplain (or a 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or wetland.</P>
            <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, HUD's or the responsible entity's consideration of practicable alternatives to the proposed site selected for a project should include:</P>
            <P>(i) Locations outside and not affecting the 100-year floodplain (or the 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or wetland;</P>
            <P>(ii) Alternative methods to serve the identical project objective, including feasible technological alternatives; and</P>
            <P>(iii) A determination not to approve any action proposing the occupancy or modification of a floodplain or wetland.</P>
            <P>(2) Practicability of alternative sites should be addressed in light of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) Natural values such as topography, habitat, and hazards;</P>
            <P>(ii) Social values such as aesthetics, historic and cultural values, land use patterns, and environmental justice; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Economic values such as the cost of space, construction, services, and relocation.</P>
            <P>(3) For multifamily projects involving HUD mortgage insurance that are initiated by third parties, HUD's consideration of practicable alternatives should include a determination not to approve the request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> Identify and evaluate the potential direct and indirect impacts associated with the occupancy or modification of the 100-year floodplain (or the 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or the wetland and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Floodplain evaluation:</E> The focus of the floodplain evaluation should be on adverse impacts to lives and property, and on natural and beneficial floodplain values. Natural and beneficial values include:</P>
            <P>(i) Water resources such as natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and groundwater recharge;</P>
            <P>(ii) Living resources such as flora and fauna;</P>
            <P>(iii) Cultural resources such as archaeological, historic, and recreational aspects; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Agricultural, aquacultural, and forestry resources.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Wetland evaluation:</E> In accordance with Section 5 of Executive Order 11990, the decisionmaker shall consider factors relevant to a proposal's effect on the survival and quality of the wetland. Among these factors that should be evaluated are:</P>
            <P>(i) Public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge, and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards and hazard protection; and sediment and erosion;</P>
            <P>(ii) Maintenance of natural systems, including conservation and long-term productivity of existing flora and fauna; species and habitat diversity and stability; natural hydrologic function; wetland type; fish; wildlife; timber; and food and fiber resources;</P>
            <P>(iii) Cost increases attributed to wetland-required new construction and mitigation measures to minimize harm to wetlands that may result from such use; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Step 5.</E> Where practicable, design or modify the proposed action to minimize the potential adverse impacts to and from the 100-year floodplain (or the 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or the wetland and to restore and <PRTPAGE P="383"/>preserve its natural and beneficial functions and values.</P>
            <P>(1) Minimization techniques for floodplain and wetland purposes include, but are not limited to: the use of permeable surfaces, natural landscape enhancements that maintain or restore natural hydrology through infiltration, native plant species, bioswales, evapotranspiration, stormwater capture and reuse, green or vegetative roofs with drainage provisions, and Natural Resource Conservation Service conservation easements. Floodproofing and elevating structures, including freeboard above the required base flood elevations, are also minimization techniques for floodplain purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) Appropriate and practicable compensatory mitigation is recommended for unavoidable adverse impacts to more than one acre of wetland. Compensatory mitigation includes, but is not limited to: permitee-responsible mitigation, mitigation banking, in-lieu fee mitigation, the use of preservation easements or protective covenants, and any form of mitigation promoted by state or Federal agencies. The use of compensatory mitigation may not substitute for the requirement to avoid and minimize impacts to the maximum extent practicable.</P>
            <P>(3) Actions covered by § 55.12(a) must be rejected if the proposed minimization is financially or physically unworkable. All critical actions in the 500-year floodplain shall be designed and built at or above the 100-year floodplain (in the case of new construction) and modified to include:</P>
            <P>(i) Preparation of and participation in an early warning system;</P>
            <P>(ii) An emergency evacuation and relocation plan;</P>
            <P>(iii) Identification of evacuation route(s) out of the 500-year floodplain; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Identification marks of past or estimated flood levels on all structures.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Step 6.</E> Reevaluate the proposed action to determine:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the action is still practicable in light of exposure to flood hazards in the floodplain or wetland, possible adverse impacts on the floodplain or wetland, the extent to which it will aggravate the current hazards to other floodplains or wetlands, and the potential to disrupt the natural and beneficial functions and values of floodplains or wetlands; and</P>
            <P>(2) Whether alternatives preliminarily rejected at Step 3 (paragraph (c)) of this section are practicable in light of information gained in Steps 4 and 5 (paragraphs (d) and (e)) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) The reevaluation of alternatives shall include the potential impacts avoided or caused inside and outside the floodplain or wetland area. The impacts should include the protection of human life, real property, and the natural and beneficial functions and values served by the floodplain or wetland.</P>
            <P>(ii) A reevaluation of alternatives under this step should include a discussion of economic costs. For floodplains, the cost estimates should include savings or the costs of flood insurance, where applicable; flood proofing; replacement of services or functions of critical actions that might be lost; and elevation to at least the base flood elevation for sites located in floodplains, as appropriate on the applicable source under § 55.2(b)(1). For wetlands, the cost estimates should include the cost of filling the wetlands and mitigation.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Step 7.</E> (1) If the reevaluation results in a determination that there is no practicable alternative to locating the proposal in the 100-year floodplain (or the 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action) or the wetland, publish a final notice that includes:</P>
            <P>(i) The reasons why the proposal must be located in the floodplain or wetland;</P>
            <P>(ii) A list of the alternatives considered in accordance with paragraphs(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(iii) All mitigation measures to be taken to minimize adverse impacts and to restore and preserve natural and beneficial functions and values.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition, the public notice procedures of § 55.20(b)(1) shall be followed, and a minimum of 7 calendar days for public comment before approval of the proposed action shall be provided.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Step 8.</E> Upon completion of the decisionmaking process in Steps 1 <PRTPAGE P="384"/>through 7, implement the proposed action. There is a continuing responsibility on HUD (or on the responsible entity authorized by 24 CFR part 58) and the recipient (if other than the responsible entity) to ensure that the mitigating measures identified in Step 7 are implemented.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Areawide compliance.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A HUD-approved areawide compliance process may be substituted for individual compliance or aggregated compliance under § 55.24 where a series of individual actions is proposed or contemplated in a pertinent area for HUD's examination of floodplain hazards. In areawide compliances, the area for examination may include a sector of, or the entire, floodplain—as relevant to the proposed or anticipated actions. The areawide compliance process shall be in accord with the decision making process under § 55.20.</P>

            <P>(b) The areawide compliance process shall address the relevant executive orders and shall consider local land use planning and development controls (e.g., those enforced by the community for purposes of floodplain management under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)) and applicable state programs for floodplain management. The process shall include the development and publication of a strategy that identifies the range of development and mitigation measures under which the proposed HUD assistance may be approved and that indicates the <PRTPAGE P="385"/>types of actions that will not be approved in the floodplain.</P>
            <P>(c) Individual actions that fit within the types of proposed HUD actions specifically addressed under the areawide compliance do not require further compliance with § 55.20 except that a determination by the Department or a responsible entitysubject to 24 CFR part 58 shall be made concerning whether the individual action accords with the areawide strategy. Where the individual action does not accord with the areawide strategy, specific development and mitigation measures shall be prescribed as a condition of HUD's approval of the individual action.</P>
            <P>(d) Areawide compliance under the procedures of this section is subject to the following provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) It shall be initiated by HUD through a formal agreement of understanding with affected local governments concerning mutual responsibilities governing the preparation, issuance, implementation, and enforcement of the areawide strategy;</P>
            <P>(2) It may be performed jointly with one or more Federal departments or agencies, or responsible entities subject to 24 CFR part 58 that serve as the responsible Federal official;</P>
            <P>(3) It shall establish mechanisms to ensure that:</P>
            <P>(i) The terms of approval of individual actions (e.g., concerning structures and facilities) will be consistent with the areawide strategy;</P>
            <P>(ii) The controls set forth in the areawide strategy are implemented and enforced in a timely manner; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Where necessary, mitigation for individual actions will be established as a condition of approval.</P>
            <P>(4) An open scoping process (in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7) shall be used for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying significant issues related to housing and community development for the floodplain;</P>
            <P>(5) Federal, state and local agencies with expertise in floodplain management, flood evacuation preparedness, land use planning and building regulation, or soil and natural resource conservation shall be invited to participate in the scoping process and to provide advice and comments; and</P>

            <P>(6) Eligibility for participation in and the use of the areawide compliance must be limited to communities that are in the Regular Program of the National Flood Insurance Program and in good standing (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> not suspended from program eligibility or placed on probation under 44 CFR 59.24), thereby demonstrating a capacity for and commitment to floodplain management standards sufficient to perform responsibilities under this part.</P>
            <P>(7) An expiration date (not to exceed ten years from the date of the formal adoption by the local governments) for HUD approval of areawide compliance under this part must be stated in the agreement between the local governments and HUD. In conjunction with the setting of an expiration date, a mechanism for HUD's reevaluation of the appropriateness of areawide compliance must be provided in the agreement.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Assumption authority.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Assumption authority for responsible entities: General.</E> Responsible entities shall assume the responsibility for environmental review, decision-making, and action that would otherwise apply to HUD under NEPA and other provisions of law that further the purposes of NEPA, as specified in § 58.5. Responsible entities that receive assistance directly from HUD assume these responsibilities by execution of a grant agreement with HUD and/or a legally binding document such as the certification contained on HUD Form 7015.15, certifying to the assumption of environmental responsibilities. When a State distributes funds to a responsible entity, the State must provide for appropriate procedures by which these responsible entities will evidence their <PRTPAGE P="391"/>assumption of environmental responsibilities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Particular responsibilities of the States.</E> (1) States are recipients for purposes of directly undertaking a State project and must assume the environmental review responsibilities for the State's activities and those of any non-governmental entity that may participate in the project. In this case, the State must submit the certification and RROF to HUD for approval.</P>
            <P>(2) States must exercise HUD's responsibilities in accordance with § 58.18, with respect to approval of a unit of local government's environmental certification and RROF for a HUD assisted project funded through the state. Approval by the state of a unit of local government's certification and RROF satisfies the Secretary's responsibilities under NEPA and the related laws cited in § 58.5.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Particular responsibilities of Indian tribes.</E> An Indian tribe may, but is not required to, assume responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making and action for programs authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (other than title VIII) or section 184 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 1715z-13a). The tribe must make a separate decision regarding assumption of responsibilities for each of these Acts and communicate that decision in writing to HUD. If the tribe assumes these responsibilities, the requirements of this part shall apply. If a tribe formally declines assumption of these responsibilities, they are retained by HUD and the provisions of part 50 of this title apply.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Tiering.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Responsible entities may tier their environmental reviews and assessments to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues at subsequent levels of review. Tiering is appropriate when there is a requirement to evaluate a policy or proposal in the early stages of development or when site-specific analysis or mitigation is not currently feasible and a more narrow or focused analysis is better done at a later date. The site specific review need only reference or summarize the issues addressed in the broader review. The broader review should identify and evaluate those issues ripe for decision and exclude those issues not relevant to the policy, program or project under consideration. The broader review should also establish the policy, standard or process to be followed in the site specific review. The Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to the broader assessment shall include a summary of the assessment and identify the significant issues to be considered in site specific reviews. Subsequent site-specific reviews will not require notices or a Request for Release of Funds unless the Certifying Officer determines that there are unanticipated impacts or impacts not adequately addressed in the prior review. A tiering approach can be used for meeting environmental review requirements in areas designated for special focus in local Consolidated Plans. Local and State Governments are encouraged to use the Consolidated Plan process to facilitate environmental reviews.</P>

In addition, until the RROF and the related certification have been approved, neither a recipient nor any participant in the development process may commit non-HUD funds on or undertake an activity or project under a program listed in § 58.1(b) if the activity or project would have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.</P>
            <P>(b) If a project or activity is exempt under § 58.34, or is categorically excluded (except in extraordinary circumstances) under § 58.35(b), no RROF is required and the recipient may undertake the activity immediately after the responsible entity has documented its determination as required in § 58.34(b) and § 58.35(d), but the recipient must comply with applicable requirements under § 58.6.</P>
            <P>(c) If a recipient is considering an application from a prospective subrecipient or beneficiary and is aware that the prospective subrecipient or beneficiary is about to take an action within the jurisdiction of the recipient that is prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section, then the recipient will take appropriate action to ensure that the objectives and procedures of NEPA are achieved.</P>
            <P>(d) An option agreement on a proposed site or property is allowable prior to the completion of the environmental review if the option agreement is subject to a determination by the recipient on the desirability of the property for the project as a result of the completion of the environmental review in accordance with this part and the cost of the option is a nominal portion of the purchase price. There is no constraint on the purchase of an option by third parties that have not been selected for HUD funding, have no responsibility for the environmental review and have no say in the approval or disapproval of the project.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP).</E> In accordance with section 11(d)(2)(A) of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 12805 note), an organization, consortium, or affiliate receiving assistance under the SHOP program may advance nongrant funds to acquire <PRTPAGE P="396"/>land prior to completion of an environmental review and approval of a Request for Release of Funds (RROF) and certification, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section. Any advances to acquire land prior to approval of the RROF and certification are made at the risk of the organization, consortium, or affiliate and reimbursement for such advances may depend on the result of the environmental review. This authorization is limited to the SHOP program only and all other forms of HUD assistance are subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Relocation.</E> Funds may be committed for relocation assistance before the approval of the RROF and related certification for the project provided that the relocation assistance is required by 24 CFR part 42.</P>

            <P>(a) A responsible entity must group together and evaluate as a single project all individual activities which are related either on a geographical or functional basis, or are logical parts of a composite of contemplated actions.</P>

            <P>(b) In deciding the most appropriate basis for aggregation when evaluating activities under more than one program, the responsible entity may choose: <E T="03">functional aggregation</E> when a specific type of activity (e.g., water improvements) is to take place in several separate locales or jurisdictions; <E T="03">geographic aggregation</E> when a mix of dissimilar but related activities is to be concentrated in a fairly specific project area (e.g., a combination of water, sewer and street improvements and economic development activities); or <E T="03">a combination of aggregation approaches,</E> which, for various project locations, considers the impacts arising from each functional activity and its interrelationship with other activities.</P>
            <P>(c) The purpose of project aggregation is to group together related activities so that the responsible entity can:</P>
            <P>(1) Address adequately and analyze, in a single environmental review, the separate and combined impacts of activities that are similar, connected and closely related, or that are dependent upon other activities and actions. (See 40 CFR 1508.25(a)).</P>
            <P>(2) Consider reasonable alternative courses of action.</P>
            <P>(3) Schedule the activities to resolve conflicts or mitigate the individual, combined and/or cumulative effects.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Multi-year project aggregation</E>—(1) <E T="03">Release of funds.</E> When a recipient's planning and program development provide for activities to be implemented over two or more years, the responsible entity's environmental review should consider the relationship among all component activities of the multi-year project regardless of the source of funds and address and evaluate their cumulative environmental effects. The estimated range of the aggregated activities and the estimated cost of the total project must be listed <PRTPAGE P="397"/>and described by the responsible entity in the environmental review and included in the RROF. The release of funds will cover the entire project period.</P>
            <P>(2) When one or more of the conditions described in § 58.47 exists, the recipient or other responsible entity must re-evaluate the environmental review.</P>

            <P>(b) If funds are needed on an emergency basis and adherence to separate comment periods would prevent the giving of assistance during a Presidentially declared disaster, or during a local emergency that has been declared by the chief elected official of the responsible entity who has proclaimed that there is an immediate need for public action to protect the public safety, the combined Notice of FONSI and Notice of Intent to Request Release of Funds (NOI/RROF) may be disseminated and/or published simultaneously with the submission of the RROF. The combined Notice of FONSI and NOI/RROF shall state that the funds are needed on an emergency basis due to a declared disaster and that the comment periods have been combined.

            <P>Categorical exclusion refers to a category of activities for which no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact under NEPA is <PRTPAGE P="398"/>required, except in extraordinary circumstances (see § 58.2(a)(3)) in which a normally excluded activity may have a significant impact. Compliance with the other applicable Federal environmental laws and authorities listed in § 58.5 is required for any categorical exclusion listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Categorical exclusions subject to § 58.5.</E> The following activities are categorically excluded under NEPA, but may be subject to review under authorities listed in § 58.5:</P>
            <P>(1) Acquisition, repair, improvement, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of public facilities and improvements (other than buildings) when the facilities and improvements are in place and will be retained in the same use without change in size or capacity of more than 20 percent (e.g., replacement of water or sewer lines, reconstruction of curbs and sidewalks, repaving of streets).</P>
            <P>(2) Special projects directed to the removal of material and architectural barriers that restrict the mobility of and accessibility to elderly and handicapped persons.</P>
            <P>(3) Rehabilitation of buildings and improvements when the following conditions are met:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of a building for residential use (with one to four units), the density is not increased beyond four units, and the land use is not changed;</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of multifamily residential buildings:</P>
            <P>(A) Unit density is not changed more than 20 percent;</P>
            <P>(B) The project does not involve changes in land use from residential to non-residential; and</P>
            <P>(C) The estimated cost of rehabilitation is less than 75 percent of the total estimated cost of replacement after rehabilitation.</P>
            <P>(iii) In the case of non-residential structures, including commercial, industrial, and public buildings:</P>
            <P>(A) The facilities and improvements are in place and will not be changed in size or capacity by more than 20 percent; and</P>
            <P>(B) The activity does not involve a change in land use, such as from non-residential to residential, commercial to industrial, or from one industrial use to another.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) An individual action on up to four dwelling units where there is a maximum of four units on any one site. The units can be four one-unit buildings or one four-unit building or any combination in between; or</P>
            <P>(ii) An individual action on a project of five or more housing units developed on scattered sites when the sites are more than 2,000 feet apart and there are not more than four housing units on any one site.</P>
            <P>(iii) Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to rehabilitation of a building for residential use (with one to four units) (see paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section).</P>
            <P>(5) Acquisition (including leasing) or disposition of, or equity loans on an existing structure, or acquisition (including leasing) of vacant land provided that the structure or land acquired, financed, or disposed of will be retained for the same use.</P>
            <P>(6) Combinations of the above activities.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Categorical exclusions not subject to § 58.5.</E> The Department has determined that the following categorically excluded activities would not alter any conditions that would require a review or compliance determination under the Federal laws and authorities cited in § 58.5. When the following kinds of activities are undertaken, the responsible entity does not have to publish a NOI/RROF or execute a certification and the recipient does not have to submit a RROF to HUD (or the State) except in the circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section. Following the award of the assistance, no further approval from HUD or the State will be needed with respect to environmental requirements, except where paragraph (c) of this section applies. The recipient remains responsible for carrying out any applicable requirements under § 58.6.</P>
            <P>(1) Tenant-based rental assistance;</P>

            <P>(2) Supportive services including, but not limited to, health care, housing services, permanent housing placement, day care, nutritional services, short-term payments for rent/mortgage/utility costs, and assistance in <PRTPAGE P="399"/>gaining access to local, State, and Federal government benefits and services;</P>

If the responsible entity adopts an EIS prepared by another agency, the procedure in 40 CFR 1506.3 shall be followed. An adopted EIS may have to be revised and modified to adapt it to the particular environmental conditions and circumstances of the project if these are different from the project reviewed in the EIS. In such cases the responsible entity must prepare, circulate, and file a supplemental draft EIS in the manner prescribed in § 58.60(d) and otherwise comply with the clearance and time requirements of the EIS process, except that scoping requirements under 40 CFR 1501.7 shall not apply. The agency that prepared the original EIS should be informed that the responsible entity intends to amend and adopt the EIS. The responsible entity may adopt an EIS when it acts as a cooperating agency in its preparation under 40 CFR 1506.3. The responsible entity is not required to re-circulate or file the EIS, but must complete the clearance process for the RROF. The decision to adopt an EIS shall be made a part of the project ERR.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Public and agency redress.</E> Persons and agencies seeking redress in relation to environmental reviews covered by an approved certification shall deal with the responsible entity and not with HUD. It is HUD's policy to refer all inquiries and complaints to the responsible entity and its Certifying Officer. Similarly, the State (where applicable) may direct persons and agencies <PRTPAGE P="406"/>seeking redress in relation to environmental reviews covered by an approved certification to deal with the responsible entity, and not the State, and may refer inquiries and complaints to the responsible entity and its Certifying Officer. Remedies for noncompliance are set forth in program regulations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Implementation of environmental review decisions.</E> Projects of a recipient will require post-review monitoring and other inspection and enforcement actions by the recipient and the State or HUD (using procedures provided for in program regulations) to assure that decisions adopted through the environmental review process are carried out during project development and implementation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Responsibility for monitoring and training.</E> (1) At least once every three years, HUD intends to conduct in-depth monitoring and exercise quality control (through training and consultation) over the environmental activities performed by responsible entities under this part. Limited monitoring of these environmental activities will be conducted during each program monitoring site visit. If through limited or in-depth monitoring of these environmental activities or by other means, HUD becomes aware of any environmental deficiencies, HUD may take one or more of the following actions:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of problems found during limited monitoring, HUD may schedule in-depth monitoring at an earlier date or may schedule in-depth monitoring more frequently;</P>
            <P>(ii) HUD may require attendance by staff of the responsible entity at HUD-sponsored or approved training, which will be provided periodically at various locations around the country;</P>
            <P>(iii) HUD may refuse to accept the certifications of environmental compliance on subsequent grants;</P>
            <P>(iv) HUD may suspend or terminate the responsible entity's assumption of the environmental review responsibility;</P>
            <P>(v) HUD may initiate sanctions, corrective actions, or other remedies specified in program regulations or agreements or contracts with the recipient.</P>
            <P>(2) HUD's responsibilities and action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be construed to limit or reduce any responsibility assumed by a responsible entity with respect to any particular release of funds under this part. Whether or not HUD takes action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Certifying Officer remains the responsible Federal official under § 58.13 with respect to projects and activities for which the Certifying Officer has submitted a certification under this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>To what does this policy apply?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as detailed in § 60.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.</P>
          <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>62</SU>

          <P>(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.</P>
          <P>(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.</P>
          <P>(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.</P>

          <P>(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.</P>
          <P>(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.<SU>63</SU>

            <FTREF/> Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent <PRTPAGE P="408"/>with the principles of the Belmont Report.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 60.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 60.103(d)).</P>
          <P>(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.</P>
          <P>(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.</P>
          <P>(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 60.101(i) or exempted under § 60.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.</P>

          <P>(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 60.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).</P>

          <P>(a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.</P>

          <P>(b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of <PRTPAGE P="412"/>45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) <E T="03">Subpart B.</E> Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Subpart C.</E> The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.</P>
          <P>(3) <E T="03">Subpart D.</E> The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.</P>
          <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:</P>
          <P>(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</P>
          <P>(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 60.111(a)(7).</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>
          <P>(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;</P>
          <P>(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</P>
          <P>(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 60.111(a)(7).</P>

          <P>(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such <PRTPAGE P="413"/>criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.</P>
          <P>(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.</P>
          <P>(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</P>

          <P>(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.</P>
          <P>(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:</P>
          <P>(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;</P>
          <P>(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 60.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).</P>
          <P>(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 60.108(b).</P>
          <P>(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Criteria for IRB approval of research.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:</P>
          <P>(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:</P>
          <P>(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and</P>
          <P>(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.</P>

          <P>(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.</P>

          <P>(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. <PRTPAGE P="417"/>The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.</P>
          <P>(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 60.116.</P>
          <P>(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 60.117.</P>
          <P>(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.</P>
          <P>(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
          <P>(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 60.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:</P>
          <P>(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 60.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);</P>
          <P>(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 60.117; and</P>
          <P>(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</P>
          <P>(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.</P>

          <P>(4) The prospective subject or the legally authorized representative must be provided with the information that a reasonable person would want to have in order to make an informed decision about whether to participate, and an opportunity to discuss that information.</P>
          <P>(5) Except for broad consent obtained in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section:</P>
          <P>(i) Informed consent must begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is most likely to assist a prospective subject or legally authorized representative in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to participate in the research. This part of the informed consent must be organized and presented in a way that facilitates comprehension.</P>
          <P>(ii) Informed consent as a whole must present information in sufficient detail relating to the research, and must be organized and presented in a way that does not merely provide lists of isolated facts, but rather facilitates the prospective subject's or legally authorized representative's understanding of the reasons why one might or might not want to participate.</P>
          <P>(6) No informed consent may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally authorized representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Basic elements of informed consent.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section, in seeking informed consent the following information shall be provided to each subject or the legally authorized representative:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Documentation of informed consent.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.</P>
          <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:</P>
          <P>(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 60.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.</P>

          <P>(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 60.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 60.116(a)(5)(i) was <PRTPAGE P="423"/>presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.</P>
          <P>(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:</P>
          <P>(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;</P>
          <P>(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or</P>
          <P>(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.</P>
          <P>(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose and authority.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) This part implements section 955 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), which provides an exemption from the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates determined under the Davis-Bacon Act or (in the case of laborers and mechanics employed in the operation of public housing projects, and architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development of public housing projects) determined or adopted by HUD, for volunteers employed on projects that are subject to prevailing wage rates under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (including Community Development Block Grants, section 108 loan guarantees, and Urban Development Action Grants), under section 12 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (public housing development and operation and section 8 projects), and under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 for elderly and handicapped housing <PRTPAGE P="425"/>projects prior to the effective date of the amendment of section 202 by section 801 of NAHA. This part also implements other provisions that provide an exemption for volunteers, including section 286 of NAHA (the HOME program), section 202 of the House Act of 1959, as amended by NAHA (supportive housing for the elderly), and any later-enacted exemptions.</P>
          <P>(b) This part is also applicable to all HUD programs for which there is a statutory provision allowing HUD to waive Davis-Bacon wage rates for volunteers that are not otherwise employed at any time on the work for which the individual volunteers. These programs include section 811 of NAHA (supportive housing for persons with disabilities), FHA mortgage insurance programs under sections 221(d)(3) and (d)(4) (each with respect to cooperative housing projects only), 221(h)(1) (but only where a nonprofit organization undertakes the construction), 235(j)(1) (but only where a nonprofit organization undertakes the construction), 231, 232, 236 and 242 of the National Housing Act, rehabilitation under section 312 of the Housing Act of 1964 and college housing under section 402 of the Housing Act of 1950.</P>
          <P>(c) This part provides definitions and procedures for determining allowable payments to volunteers, determining who is a bona fide volunteer, and otherwise implementing exemptions from and waivers of prevailing wage requirements where volunteers are employed.</P>

          <P>This part applies to all HUD programs for which there is a statutory exemption from Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined prevailing wage rates for volunteers or a statutory provision allowing HUD waiver of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates for volunteers. The programs to which this part applies include the programs listed in section 70.1(a) and (b) and any other program for which a statutory exemption or HUD waiver provision for volunteers is enacted. This part does not, however, apply to HUD waivers of prevailing wage requirements under section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for public housing residents who volunteer a portion of their labor (see 24 CFR 964.41). This part also does not apply to the contribution of labor by an eligible family under the Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program for Indian families under section 202 of the United States Housing Act of 1937.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A <E T="03">volunteer,</E> for purposes of this part, is an individual who performs service for a public or private entity for civic, charitable, or humanitarian reasons, without promise, expectation or receipt of compensation for services rendered, on a HUD-assisted or insured project which is subject to a requirement to pay prevailing wage rates.</P>
          <P>(1) Individuals shall be considered volunteers only where their services are offered freely and without pressure and coercion, direct or implied, from an employer.</P>
          <P>(2) An individual shall not be considered a volunteer if the individual is otherwise employed at any time in the construction or maintenance work for which the individual volunteers.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Expenses, reasonable benefits, or nominal fees</E> may be provided to volunteers without the status of the volunteer being lost but only after a determination is made by HUD on a case-by-case basis by examining the total amount of payments made (expenses, benefits, fees) in the context of the economic realities of the particular situation. Subject to this determination:</P>
          <P>(1) A payment for an <E T="03">expense</E> may be received by a volunteer for items such as uniform allowances or reimbursement for reasonable cleaning expenses or wear and tear on personal clothing worn while performing the volunteer work. Additionally, reimbursement for approximate out-of-pocket expenses for the cost of meals and transportation expenses may be made.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Reasonable benefits</E> may constitute inclusion of individual volunteers in group insurance plans (such as liability, health, life, disability, workers' compensation) or pension plan or length of service awards.</P>
          <P>(3) A <E T="03">nominal fee</E> is not a substitute for compensation and must not be tied to productivity. The decision as to what constitutes “nominal” must be made on a case-by-case basis and in the <PRTPAGE P="426"/>context of the economic realities of the situation.</P>
          <P>(4) The phrase <E T="03">economic realities</E> means that in determining whether the fee described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be deemed “nominal”, the amount of the fee must be judged in the context of what paid workers doing the same work would earn in the particular locality involved. For example, a “payment” made to a “homeless” volunteer in an amount which covers basic necessities but nonetheless represents an insignificant amount when compared with local cost of living and real wages may be determined to be nominal for purposes of qualifying as a volunteer, provided the payment is not in fact a substitute for compensation and is not tied in any way to productivity.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Prevailing wage rates,</E> for purposes of this part, means:</P>
          <P>(1) Wage rates required to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the construction (including rehabilitation) of a project (or in the case of public housing, the development of the project), as determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act;</P>
          <P>(2) Wage rates required to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the operation of a public housing project, as determined or adopted by the Secretary of HUD; and</P>
          <P>(3) Wage rates required to be paid to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development of a public housing project, as determined or adopted by the Secretary of HUD.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedure for implementing prevailing wage exemptions for volunteers.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) This section applies to those HUD programs for which there is a statutory <E T="03">exemption</E> for volunteers, as referenced in § 70.1(a).</P>
          <P>(b) Local or State agencies or private parties whose employees are otherwise subject to Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined prevailing wage rates which propose to use volunteers and wish to pay the volunteers' expenses, reasonable benefits, or nominal fees shall request a determination from HUD that these payments meet the criteria in § 70.3(b). A written determination shall be provided to the requester by the Department within ten days of receipt by the Department of sufficient information to allow for the determination.</P>
          <P>(c) A determination under paragraph (b) shall not be construed in any way as limiting the use of bona fide volunteers on HUD-assisted construction, but rather is required to ensure that the Department performs its appropriate responsibilities under Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 1950 and related Department of Labor Regulations in title 29 CFR part 5, regarding the administration and enforcement of the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts, and its responsibility for the administration and enforcement of HUD-determined or adopted wage rates in the operation of public housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937.</P>
          <P>(d) For a project covered by prevailing wage rate requirements in which all the work is to be done by volunteers and there are no paid construction employees, the local or State funding agency (or, if none, the entity that employs the volunteers) shall record in the pertinent project file the name and address of the agency sponsoring the project, a description of the project (location, cost, nature of the work), and the number of volunteers and the hours of work they performed. The entity responsible for recording this information shall also provide a copy of this information to HUD.</P>
          <P>(e) For a project covered by prevailing wage rate requirements in which there is to be a mix of paid workers and volunteers, the local or State funding agency (or, if none, the entity responsible for generating certified payrolls) shall provide HUD the information in paragraph (d) of this section, along with the names of the volunteers.</P>
          <P>(f) Volunteers who receive no expenses, benefits or fees described in (c) and are otherwise bona fide shall be recorded as in (d) or (e).</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 70.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Procedure for obtaining HUD waiver of prevailing wage rates for volunteers.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) This section applies to those HUD programs under which HUD is statutorily authorized to <E T="03">waive</E> prevailing <PRTPAGE P="427"/>wage requirements for volunteers, as referenced in § 70.1(b).</P>
          <P>(b) Local or State agencies or private parties whose employees are otherwise subject to prevailing wage rates and which wish to use volunteers shall request a waiver of prevailing wage requirements from HUD for the volunteers. A request for waiver shall indicate that the proposed volunteers are volunteering their services for the purposes of lowering the costs of construction. The request shall include information sufficient for HUD to make a determination, as required by statute, that any amounts saved through the use of volunteers are fully credited to the corporation, cooperative, or public body or agency undertaking the construction and a determination that any payments to volunteers meet the criteria in section 70.3(b). Information regarding the crediting of amounts saved is required in order to insure that the statutorily prescribed purpose of lowering the costs of construction is fulfilled by passing savings from the use of volunteers on to the sponsor or other body or agency undertaking the construction, rather than permitting the retention of any savings as a windfall by a contractor or subcontractor. A written waiver shall be provided to the requestor by the Department within ten days of receipt by the Department of sufficient information to meet the requirements for a waiver.</P>
          <P>(c) For a project covered by prevailing wage rate requirements in which all the work is to be done by volunteers and there are no paid construction employees, the local or State funding agency (or, if none, the entity that employs the volunteers) shall record in the pertinent project file the name and address of the agency sponsoring the project, the name, location, and HUD project number (if any) of the project, the number of volunteers, and type of work and hours of work they performed. The entity responsible for recording this information shall provide a copy of the information to HUD.</P>
          <P>(d) For a project covered by prevailing wage rate requirements in which there is to be a mix of paid workers and volunteers, the local or State funding agency (or, if none, the entity responsible for generating certified payrolls) shall provide HUD the information in (c) of this section, along with the names of the proposed volunteers.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special Affordable Housing Goal.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of the goal.</E> This goal is intended to achieve increased purchases by the GSEs of mortgages on rental and owner-occupied housing meeting the then-existing unaddressed needs of, and affordable to, low-income families in low-income areas and very-low-income families.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Factors.</E> In establishing the Special Affordable Housing Goals, the Secretary considered the factors in 12 U.S.C. 4563(a)(2). A statement documenting HUD's considerations and findings with respect to these factors, entitled “Departmental Considerations to Establish the Special Affordable Housing Goal,” was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on November 2, 2004.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Goals.</E> The annual goals for each GSE's purchases of mortgages on rental and owner-occupied housing meeting the then-existing, unaddressed needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families are:</P>
            <P>(1) For the year 2005, 22 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA. The goal for the year 2005 shall include mortgage purchases financing dwelling units in multifamily housing totaling not less than 1.0 percent of the average annual dollar volume of combined (single-family and multifamily) mortgages purchased by the respective GSE in 2000, 2001, and 2002, unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA. In addition, as a Special Affordable Housing Home Purchase Subgoal, 17 percent of the total number of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases shall be home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas which count toward the Special Affordable Housing Goal in the year 2005 unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA;</P>

            <P>(2) For the year 2006, 23 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA. The goal for the year 2006 shall include mortgage purchases financing dwelling units in multifamily housing totaling not less than 1.0 percent of the average annual dollar volume of combined (single-family and multifamily) mortgages purchased by the respective GSE in 2000, 2001, and 2002, unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA. In addition, as a Special Affordable Housing Home Purchase <PRTPAGE P="437"/>Subgoal, 17 percent of the total number of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases shall be home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas which count toward the Special Affordable Housing Goal in the year 2006 unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA;</P>

            <P>(5) For the year 2009 and thereafter HUD shall establish annual goals. Pending establishment of goals for the year 2009 and thereafter, the annual goal for each of those years shall be 27 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases in each of those years. The goal for each such year shall include mortgage purchases financing dwelling units in multifamily housing totaling not less than 1.0 percent of the annual average dollar volume of combined (single-family and multifamily) mortgages purchased by the respective GSE in the years 2000, 2001, and 2002. In addition, as a Special Affordable Housing Home Purchase Subgoal, 18 percent of the total number of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases shall be home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas which count toward the Special Affordable Housing Goal in each of those years unless otherwise adjusted by HUD in accordance with FHEFSSA.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Counting of multifamily units.</E> (1) Dwelling units affordable to low-income families and financed by a particular purchase of a mortgage on multifamily housing shall count toward achievement of the Special Affordable Housing Goal where at least:</P>
            <P>(i) 20 percent of the dwelling units in the particular multifamily property are affordable to especially low-income families; or</P>
            <P>(ii) 40 percent of the dwelling units in the particular multifamily property are affordable to very-low-income families.</P>
            <P>(2) Where only some of the units financed by a purchase of a mortgage on multifamily housing count under the multifamily component of the goal, only a portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage attributable to such units shall count toward the multifamily component. The portion of the mortgage counted under the multifamily requirement shall be equal to the ratio of the total units that count to the total number of units in the mortgaged property.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Full Credit Activities.</E> (1) For purposes of 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1) and this paragraph (e), full credit means that <PRTPAGE P="438"/>each unit financed by a mortgage purchased by a GSE and meeting the requirements of this section shall count toward achievement of the Special Affordable Housing Goal for that GSE.</P>
            <P>(2) Mortgages insured under HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (“HECM”) Insurance Program, 12 U.S.C. 1715 z-20; mortgages guaranteed under the Rural Housing Service's Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, 42 U.S.C. 1472; mortgages on properties on tribal lands insured under FHA's Section 248 program, 12 U.S.C. 1715 z-13, HUD's Section 184 program, 12 U.S.C. 1515 z-13a, or Title VI of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. 4191-4195; meet the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii).</P>
            <P>(3) HUD will give full credit toward achievement of the Special Affordable Housing Goal for the activities in 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(A), provided the GSE submits documentation to HUD that supports eligibility under 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(A) for HUD's approval.</P>
            <P>(4)(i) For purposes of determining whether a seller meets the requirement in 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(B), a seller must currently operate on its own or actively participate in an on-going, discernible, active, and verifiable program directly targeted at the origination of new mortgage loans that qualify under the Special Affordable Housing Goal.</P>
            <P>(ii) A seller's activities must evidence a current intention or plan to reinvest the proceeds of the sale into mortgages qualifying under the Special Affordable Housing Goal, with a current commitment of resources on the part of the seller for this purpose.</P>
            <P>(iii) A seller's actions must evidence willingness to buy qualifying loans when these loans become available in the market as part of active, on-going, sustainable efforts to ensure that additional loans that meet the goal are originated.</P>
            <P>(iv) Actively participating in such a program includes purchasing qualifying loans from a correspondent originator, including a lender or qualified housing group, that operates an on-going program resulting in the origination of loans that meet the requirements of the goal, has a history of delivering, and currently delivers qualifying loans to the seller.</P>
            <P>(v) The GSE must verify and monitor that the seller meets the requirements in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section and develop any necessary mechanisms to ensure compliance with the requirements, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(vi) and (vii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(vi) Where a seller's primary business is originating mortgages on housing that qualifies under this Special Affordable Housing Goal such seller is presumed to meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section. Sellers that are institutions that are:</P>
            <P>(A) Regularly in the business of mortgage lending;</P>
            <P>(B) A BIF-insured or SAIF-insured depository institution; and</P>
            <P>(C) Subject to, and has received at least a satisfactory performance evaluation rating for</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) At least the two most recent consecutive examinations under, the Community Reinvestment Act, if the lending institution has total assets in excess of $250 million; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act if the lending institutions which have total assets no more than $250 million are identified as sellers that are presumed to have a primary business of originating mortgages on housing that qualifies under this Special Affordable Housing Goal and, therefore, are presumed to meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(vii) Classes of institutions or organizations that are presumed have as their primary business originating mortgages on housing that qualifies under this Special Affordable Housing Goal and, therefore. are presumed in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv) of this section to meet the requirements are as follows: State housing finance agencies; affordable housing loan consortia; Federally insured credit unions that are:</P>

            <P>(A) Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and meet the first-time homebuyer standard of the Community Support Program; or<PRTPAGE P="439"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) Community development credit unions; community development financial institutions; public loan funds; or non-profit mortgage lenders. HUD may determine that additional classes of institutions or organizations are primarily engaged in the business of financing affordable housing mortgages for purposes of this presumption, and if, so will notify the GSEs in writing.</P>
            <P>(viii) For purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, if the seller did not originate the mortgage loans, but the originator of the mortgage loans fulfills the requirements of either paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (e)(4)(iv), paragraph (e)(4)(vi) or paragraph (e)(4)(vii) of this section; and the seller has held the loans for six months or less prior to selling the loans to the GSE, HUD will consider that the seller has met the requirements of this paragraph (e)(4) and of 12 U.S.C. 4563(b)(1)(B).</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Partial credit activities.</E> Mortgages insured under HUD's Title I program, which includes property improvement and manufactured home loans, shall receive one-half credit toward the Special Affordable Housing Goal until such time as the Government National Mortgage Association fully implements a program to purchase and securitize Title I loans.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">No credit activities.</E> Neither the purchase nor the securitization of mortgages associated with the refinancing of a GSE's existing mortgage or mortgage-backed securities portfolios shall receive credit toward the achievement of the Special Affordable Housing Goal. Refinancings that result from the wholesale exchange of mortgages between the two GSEs shall not count toward the achievement of this goal. Refinancings of individual mortgages shall count toward achievement of this goal when the refinancing is an arms-length transaction that is borrower-driven and the mortgage otherwise counts toward achievement of this goal. For purposes of this paragraph (g), “mortgages or mortgage-backed securities portfolios” includes mortgages retained by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and mortgages utilized to back mortgage-backed securities.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 81.15</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>General requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Calculating the numerator and denominator.</E> Performance under each of the housing goals shall be measured using a fraction that is converted into a percentage.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">The numerator.</E> The numerator of each fraction is the number of dwelling units financed by a GSE's mortgage purchases in a particular year that count toward achievement of the housing goal.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">The denominator.</E> The denominator of each fraction is, for all mortgages purchased, the number of dwelling units that could count toward achievement of the goal under appropriate circumstances. The denominator shall not include GSE transactions or activities that are not mortgages or mortgage purchases as defined by HUD or transactions that are specifically excluded as ineligible under § 81.16(b).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Missing data or information.</E> When a GSE lacks sufficient data or information to determine whether the purchase of a mortgage originated after 1992 counts toward achievement of a particular housing goal, that mortgage purchase shall be included in the denominator for that housing goal, except under the circumstances described in paragraphs (d) and (e)(6) of this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Properties with multiple dwelling units.</E> For the purposes of counting toward the achievement of the goals, whenever the property securing a mortgage contains more than one dwelling unit, each such dwelling unit shall be counted as a separate dwelling unit financed by a mortgage purchase.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Credit toward multiple goals.</E> A mortgage purchase (or dwelling unit financed by such purchase) by a GSE in a particular year shall count toward the achievement of each housing goal for which such purchase (or dwelling unit) qualifies in that year.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Counting owner-occupied units.</E> (1) For purposes of counting owner-occupied units toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal, mortgage purchases financing such units shall be evaluated based on the income of the mortgagors and the area median income at the time of <PRTPAGE P="440"/>origination of the mortgage. To determine whether mortgages may be counted under a particular family income level, i.e., especially low, very low, low or moderate income, the income of the mortgagors is compared to the median income for the area at the time of the mortgage application, using the appropriate percentage factor provided under § 81.17.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) When the income of the mortgagor(s) is not available to determine whether an owner-occupied unit in a property securing a single-family mortgage originated after 1992 and purchased by a GSE counts toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal, a GSE's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information in accordance with one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(A) Excluding from the denominator and the numerator single-family owner-occupied units located in census tracts with median incomes less than, or equal to, area median income based on the most recent decennial census, up to a maximum of one percent of the total number of single-family owner-occupied dwelling units eligible to be counted toward the respective housing goal in the current year. Mortgage purchases with missing data in excess of the maximum will be included in the denominator and excluded from the numerator;</P>
            <P>(B) For home purchase mortgages and for refinance mortgages separately, multiplying the number of owner-occupied units with missing borrower income information in properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all single-family owner-occupied mortgage originations in the respective tracts that would count toward achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the most recent HMDA data available; or</P>
            <P>(C) Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by HUD.</P>
            <P>(ii) In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to estimate affordability information for single-family owner-occupied units.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a GSE chooses to use an estimation methodology under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) or (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section to determine affordability for owner-occupied units in properties securing single-family mortgage purchases eligible to be counted toward the respective housing goal, then that methodology may be used up to nationwide maximums for home purchase mortgages and for refinance mortgages that shall be calculated by multiplying, for each census tract, the percentage of all single-family owner-occupied mortgage originations with missing borrower incomes (as determined by HUD based on the most recent HMDA data available for home purchase and refinance mortgages, respectively) by the number of single-family owner-occupied units in properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE for each census tract, summed up over all census tracts. If this nationwide maximum is exceeded, then the estimated number of goal-qualifying units will be adjusted by the ratio of the applicable nationwide maximum number of units for which income information may be estimated to the total number of single-family owner-occupied units with missing income information in properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE. Owner-occupied units in excess of the nationwide maximum, and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall remain in the denominator of the respective goal calculation.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Counting rental units</E>—(1) <E T="03">Use of income, rent</E>—(i) <E T="03">Generally.</E> For purposes of counting rental units toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal, mortgage purchases financing such units shall be evaluated based on the income of actual or prospective tenants where such data is available, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> known to a lender.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Availability of income information.</E> (A) Each GSE shall require lenders to provide to the GSE tenant income information under paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, but only when such information is known to the lender.</P>

            <P>(B) When such tenant income information is available for all occupied units, the GSE's performance shall be <PRTPAGE P="441"/>based on the income of the tenants in the occupied units. For unoccupied units that are vacant and available for rent and for unoccupied units that are under repair or renovation and not available for rent, the GSE shall use the income of prospective tenants, if paragraph (e)(4) of this section is applicable. If paragraph (e)(4) of this section is not applicable, the GSE shall use rent levels for comparable units in the property to determine affordability.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Model units and rental offices.</E> A model unit or rental office in a multifamily property may count toward achievement of the housing goals only if a GSE determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) It is reasonably expected that the units will be occupied by a family within one year;</P>
            <P>(ii) The number of such units is reasonable and minimal considering the size of the multifamily property; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Such unit otherwise meets the requirements for the goal.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Income of actual tenants.</E> When the income of actual tenants is available, to determine whether a tenant is very-low-, low-, or moderate-income, the income of the tenant shall be compared to the median income for the area, adjusted for family size as provided in § 81.17.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Income of prospective tenants.</E> When income for tenants is available to a lender because a project is subject to a Federal housing program that establishes the maximum income for a tenant or a prospective tenant in rental units, the income of prospective tenants may be counted at the maximum income level established under such housing program for that unit. In determining the income of prospective tenants, the income shall be projected based on the types of units and market area involved. Where the income of prospective tenants is projected, each GSE must determine that the income figures are reasonable considering the rents (if any) on the same units in the past and considering current rents on comparable units in the same market area.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Use of rent.</E> When the income of the prospective or actual tenants of a dwelling unit is not available, performance under these goals will be evaluated based on rent and whether the rent is affordable to the income group targeted by the housing goal. A rent is affordable if the rent does not exceed 30 percent of the maximum income level of very-low-, low-, or moderate-income families as provided in § 81.19. In determining contract rent for a dwelling unit, the actual rent or average rent by unit type shall be used.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Affordability data unavailable.</E> (i) <E T="03">Multifamily.</E> (A) When a GSE lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a property securing a multifamily mortgage purchased by a GSE counts toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal because neither the income of prospective or actual tenants, nor the actual or average rental data, are available, a GSE's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information in accordance with one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Multiplying the number of rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the most recent decennial census. For units with missing affordability information in tracts for which such methodology is not possible, such units will be excluded from the denominator as well as the numerator in calculating performance under the respective housing goal(s); or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by HUD.</P>
            <P>(B) In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods specified in paragraph (e)(6)(i)(A) of this section to estimate affordability information for multifamily rental units.</P>

            <P>(C) If a GSE chooses to use an estimation methodology under paragraph (e)(6)(i)(A) of this section to determine affordability for rental units in properties securing multifamily mortgage purchases eligible to be counted toward the respective housing goal, then that methodology may be used up to a nationwide maximum of ten percent of the total number of rental units in <PRTPAGE P="442"/>properties securing multifamily mortgages purchased by the GSE in the current year. If this maximum is exceeded, the estimated number of goal-qualifying units will be adjusted by the ratio of the nationwide maximum number of units for which affordability information may be estimated to the total number of multifamily rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing mortgages purchased by the GSE. Multifamily rental units in excess of the maximum set forth in this paragraph (e)(6)(i)(C), and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall be removed from the denominator of the respective goal calculation.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Rental units in 1-4 unit single-family properties.</E> (A) When a GSE lacks sufficient information to determine whether a rental unit in a property securing a single-family mortgage purchased by a GSE counts toward achievement of the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Goal or the Special Affordable Housing Goal because neither the income of prospective or actual tenants, nor the actual or average rental data, are available, a GSE's performance with respect to such unit may be evaluated using estimated affordability information in accordance with one of the following methods:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Excluding rental units in 1-to 4-unit properties with missing affordability information from the denominator as well as the numerator in calculating performance under those goals;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Multiplying the number of rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing single family mortgages purchased by the GSE in each census tract by the percentage of all rental dwelling units in the respective tracts that would count toward achievement of each goal, as determined by HUD based on the most recent decennial census. For units with missing affordability information in tracts for which such methodology is not possible, such units will be excluded from the denominator as well as the numerator in calculating performance under the respective housing goal(s); or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Such other data source and methodology as may be approved by HUD.</P>
            <P>(B) In any calendar year, a GSE may use only one of the methods specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section to estimate affordability information for single-family rental units.</P>

            <P>(C) If a GSE chooses to use an estimation methodology under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) or (e)(6)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">3</E>) of this section to determine affordability for rental units in properties securing single-family mortgage purchases eligible to be counted toward the respective housing goal, then that methodology may be used up to nationwide maximums of five percent of the total number of rental units in properties securing non-seasoned single-family mortgage purchases by the GSE in the current year and 20 percent of the total number of rental units in properties securing seasoned single-family mortgage purchases by the GSE in the current year. If either or both of these maximums are exceeded, the estimated number of goal-qualifying units will be adjusted by the ratio of the applicable nationwide maximum number of units for which affordability information may be estimated to the total number of single-family rental units with missing affordability information in properties securing seasoned or unseasoned mortgages purchased by the GSE, as applicable. Single-family rental units in excess of the maximums set forth in this paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(C), and any units for which estimation information is not available, shall be removed from the denominator of the respective goal calculation.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Timeliness of information.</E> In determining performance under the housing goals, each GSE shall use tenant and rental information as of the time of mortgage:</P>
            <P>(i) Acquisition for mortgages on multifamily housing; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Origination for mortgages on single-family housing.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Application of Median income.</E> (1) For purposes of determining an area's median income under §§ 81.17 through 81.19 and for the definition of “low-income area,” the area is:</P>

            <P>(i) The metropolitan area, if the property which is the subject of the mortgage is in a metropolitan area; and<PRTPAGE P="443"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) In all other areas, the county in which the property is located, except that where the State nonmetropolitan median income is higher than the county's median income, the area is the State nonmetropolitan area.</P>
            <P>(2) When a GSE cannot precisely determine whether a mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in one area, the GSE shall determine the median income for the split area in the manner prescribed by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council for reporting under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, if the GSE can determine that the mortgage is on dwelling unit(s) located in:</P>
            <P>(i) A census tract;</P>
            <P>(ii) A census place code;</P>
            <P>(iii) A block-group enumeration district;</P>
            <P>(iv) A nine-digit zip code; or</P>
            <P>(v) Another appropriate geographic segment that is partially located in more than one area (“split area”).</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Sampling not permitted.</E> Performance under the housing goals for each year shall be based on a complete tabulation of mortgage purchases for that year; a sampling of such purchases is not acceptable.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Newly available data.</E> When a GSE uses data to determine whether a mortgage purchase counts toward achievement of any goal and new data is released after the start of a calendar quarter, the GSE need not use the new data until the start of the following quarter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Counting mortgages toward the Home Purchase Subgoals</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The requirements of this section, except for paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section, shall apply to counting mortgages toward the Home Purchase Subgoals at §§ 81.12 through 81.14. However, performance under the subgoals shall be counted using a fraction that is converted into a percentage for each subgoal and the numerator of the fraction for each subgoal shall be the number of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases in a particular year that count towards achievement of the applicable housing goal. The denominator of each fraction shall be the total number of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases in a particular year. For purposes of each subgoal, the procedure for addressing missing data or information, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be implemented using numbers of home purchase mortgages in metropolitan areas and not single-family owner-occupied dwelling units.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Special counting rule for mortgages with more than one owner-occupied unit.</E> For purposes of counting mortgages toward the Home Purchase Subgoals, where a single home purchase mortgage finances the purchase of two or more owner-occupied units in a metropolitan area, the mortgage shall count once toward each subgoal that applies to the GSE's mortgage purchase.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> HUD shall determine whether a GSE shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals. In this determination, HUD will consider whether a transaction or activity of the GSE is substantially equivalent to a mortgage purchase and either creates a new market or adds liquidity to an existing market, provided however that such mortgage purchase actually fulfills the GSE's purposes and is in accordance with its Charter Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Not counted.</E> The following transactions or activities shall not count toward achievement of any of the housing goals and shall not be included in the denominator in calculating either GSE's performance under the housing goals:</P>
            <P>(1) Equity investments in housing development projects;</P>
            <P>(2) Purchases of State and local government housing bonds except as provided in 81.16(c)(8);</P>
            <P>(3) Purchases of non-conventional mortgages except:</P>
            <P>(i) Where such mortgages are acquired under a risk-sharing arrangement with a Federal agency;</P>

            <P>(ii) Mortgages insured under HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (“HECM”) insurance program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z-20; mortgages guaranteed <PRTPAGE P="444"/>under the Rural Housing Service's Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program, 42 U.S.C. 1472; mortgages on properties on lands insured under FHA's Section 248 program, 12 U.S.C. 1715z-13, or HUD's Section 184 program, 12 U.S.C. 1515z-13a, or Title VI of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996, 25 U.S.C. 4191-4195; and mortgages with expiring assistance contracts as defined at 42 U.S.C. 1737f;</P>
            <P>(iii) Mortgages under other mortgage programs involving Federal guarantees, insurance or other Federal obligation where the Department determines in writing that the financing needs addressed by the particular mortgage program are not well served and that the mortgage purchases under such program should count under the housing goals, provided the GSE submits documentation to HUD that supports eligibility and that HUD makes such a determination, or</P>
            <P>(iv) As provided in § 81.14(e)(3)</P>
            <P>(4) Commitments to buy mortgages at a later date or time;</P>

            <P>(7) Any interests in mortgages that the Secretary determines, in writing, shall not be treated as interests in mortgages;</P>
            <P>(8) Mortgage purchases to the extent they finance any dwelling units that are secondary residences; and</P>
            <P>(9) Single family mortgage refinancings that result from conversion of balloon notes to fully amortizing notes, if the GSE already owns or has an interest in the balloon note at the time conversion occurs.</P>
            <P>(10) Any combination of factors in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Other special rules.</E> Subject to HUD's primary determination of whether a GSE shall receive full, partial, or no credit for a transaction toward achievement of any of the housing goals as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the following supplemental rules apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Credit enhancements.</E> (i) Dwelling units financed under a credit enhancement entered into by a GSE shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward achievement of the housing goals when:</P>
            <P>(A) The GSE provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under a mortgage or mortgages financed by the issuance of housing bonds (such bonds may be issued by any entity, including a State or local housing finance agency);</P>
            <P>(B) The GSE assumes a credit risk in the transaction substantially equivalent to the risk that would have been assumed by the GSE if it had securitized the mortgages financed by such bonds; and</P>
            <P>(C) Such dwelling units otherwise qualify under this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) When a GSE provides a specific contractual obligation to ensure timely payment of amounts due under any mortgage originally insured by a public purpose mortgage insurance entity or fund, the GSE may, on a case-by-case basis, seek approval from the Secretary for such activities to count toward achievement of the housing goals.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Real estate mortgage investment conduits (“REMICs”).</E> (i) A GSE's purchase or guarantee of all or a portion of a REMIC shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and receive credit toward the achievement of the housing goals provided:</P>
            <P>(A) The underlying mortgages or mortgage-backed securities for the REMIC were not:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Previously counted toward any housing goal by the GSE; and</P>
            <P>(B) The GSE has the information necessary to support counting the dwelling units financed by the REMIC, or that part of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE, toward the achievement of a particular housing goal.</P>
            <P>(ii) For REMICs that meet the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and for which the GSE purchased or guaranteed:</P>
            <P>(A) The whole REMIC, all of the units financed by the REMIC shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and count toward achievement of the housing goals; or</P>

            <P>(B) A portion of the REMIC, the GSE shall receive partial credit toward <PRTPAGE P="445"/>achievement of the housing goals. This credit shall be equal to the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE (the dollar amount of the purchase or guarantee divided by the total dollar amount of the REMIC) multiplied by the number of dwelling units that would have counted toward the goal(s) if the GSE had purchased or guaranteed the whole REMIC. In calculating performance under the housing goals, the denominator shall include the number of dwelling units included in the whole REMIC multiplied by the percentage of the REMIC purchased or guaranteed by the GSE.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Risk-sharing.</E> Mortgage purchases under risk-sharing arrangements between the GSEs and any Federal agency where the units would otherwise count toward achievement of the housing goal under which the GSE is responsible for a substantial amount (50 percent or more) of the risk shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward achievement of the housing goal or goals.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Participations.</E> Participations purchased by a GSE shall be treated as mortgage purchases and count toward the achievement of the housing goals, if the GSE's participation in the mortgage is 50 percent or more.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Cooperative housing and condominium projects.</E> (i) The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative housing unit (“a share loan”) or a condominium unit is a mortgage purchase. Such a purchase is counted toward achievement of a housing goal in the same manner as a mortgage purchase of single-family owner-occupied units, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> affordability is based on the income of the owner(s).</P>
            <P>(ii) The purchase of a mortgage on a cooperative building (“a blanket loan”) or a condominium project is a mortgage purchase and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals. Where a GSE purchases both “a blanket loan” and mortgages for units in the same building (“share loans”), both the blanket loan and the share loan(s) are mortgage purchases and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals. Where a GSE purchases both a condominium project mortgage and mortgages on condominium dwelling units in the same project, both the condominium project mortgages and the mortgages on condominium dwelling units are mortgage purchases and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Seasoned mortgages.</E> A GSE's purchase of a seasoned mortgage shall be treated as a mortgage purchase for purposes of these goals and shall be included in the numerator, as appropriate, and the denominator in calculating the GSE's performance under the housing goals, except where:</P>
            <P>(i) The GSE has already counted the mortgage under a housing goal applicable to 1993 or any subsequent year; or</P>
            <P>(ii) HUD determines, based upon a written request by a GSE, that a seasoned mortgage or class of such mortgages should be excluded from the numerator and the denominator in order to further the purposes of the Special Affordable Housing Goal.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Purchase of refinanced mortgages.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this part, the purchase of a refinanced mortgage by a GSE is a mortgage purchase and shall count toward achievement of the housing goals to the extent the mortgage qualifies.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Mortgage revenue bonds.</E> (i) The purchase of a state or local mortgage revenue bond shall be treated as a mortgage purchase and units financed under such MRB shall count toward achievement of the goals where:</P>
            <P>(A) The MRB is to be repaid only from the principal and interest of the underlying mortgages originated with funds made available by the MRB; and</P>
            <P>(B) The MRB is not a general obligation of a state or local government or agency or is not credit enchanced by any government or agency, third party guarantor or surety.</P>
            <P>(ii) Dwelling units financed by a mortgage revenue bond meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section shall count toward a housing goal to the extent such dwelling units otherwise qualify under this part.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Expiring assistance contracts.</E> In accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4565(a)(5), actions that assist in maintaining the affordability of assisted units in eligible multifamily housing projects with expiring contracts shall receive credit under the housing goals as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) and in accordance <PRTPAGE P="446"/>with paragraphs (b) and (c)(1) through (c)(9) of this section.</P>
            <P>(i) For restructured (modified) multifamily mortgage loans with an expiring assistance contract where a GSE holds the loan in portfolio and facilitates modification of loan terms that results in lower debt service to the project's owner, the GSE shall receive full credit under any of the housing goals for which the units covered by the mortgage otherwise qualify.</P>
            <P>(ii) Where a GSE undertakes more than one action to assist a single project or where a GSE engages in an activity that it believes assists in maintaining the affordability of assisted units in eligible multifamily housing projects but which is not otherwise covered in paragraph (c)(9)(i) of this section, the GSE must submit the transaction to HUD for a determination on appropriate goals counting treatment.</P>
            <P>(10)-(11) [Reserved]</P>
            <P>(12) <E T="03">HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms and conditions.</E> HOEPA mortgages and mortgages with unacceptable terms or conditions as defined in § 81.2 will not receive credit toward any of the three housing goals.</P>
            <P>(13) <E T="03">Mortgages contrary to good lending practices.</E> The Secretary will monitor the practices and processes of the GSEs to ensure that they are not purchasing loans that are contrary to good lending practices as defined in § 81.2. Based on the results of such monitoring, the Secretary may determine in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section that mortgages or categories of mortgages where a lender has not engaged in good lending practices will not receive credit toward the three housing goals.</P>
            <P>(14) <E T="03">Seller dissolution option.</E> (i) Mortgages acquired through transactions involving seller dissolution options shall be treated as mortgage purchases, and receive credit toward the achievement of the housing goals, only when:</P>
            <P>(A) The terms of the transaction provide for a lockout period that prohibits the exercise of the dissolution option for at least one year from the date on which the transaction was entered into by the GSE and the seller of the mortgages; and</P>
            <P>(B) The transaction is not dissolved during the one-year minimum lockout period.</P>
            <P>(ii) The Secretary may grant an exception to the one-year minimum lockout period described in paragraph (c)(14)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, in response to a written request from an enterprise, if the Secretary determines that the transaction furthers the purposes of FHEFSSA and the GSE's charter act;</P>
            <P>(iii) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(14), “seller dissolution option” means an option for a seller of mortgages to the GSEs to dissolve or otherwise cancel a mortgage purchase agreement or loan sale.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">HUD review of transactions.</E> HUD will determine whether a class of transactions counts as a mortgage purchase under the housing goals. If a GSE seeks to have a class of transactions counted under the housing goals that does not otherwise count under the rules in this part, the GSE may provide HUD detailed information regarding the transactions for evaluation and determination by HUD in accordance with this section. In making its determination, HUD may also request and evaluate additional information from a GSE with regard to how the GSE believes the transactions should be counted. HUD will notify the GSE of its determination regarding the extent to which the class of transactions may count under the goals.</P>

            <P>(ix) Any other information deemed relevant by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of remedial action(s).</E> (1) Following the Secretary's decision concerning the appropriate remedial action(s) that the GSE is to be directed to take, the Secretary shall prepare and issue to the GSE and the lender a written notice setting forth the remedial action(s) to be taken and the date such remedial action(s) are to commence. The Notice shall inform the lender of its right to request a hearing on the appropriateness of the proposed remedial action(s), within 20 days of service of the Notice, by filing a request with the Docket Clerk, HUD Office of Administrative Law Judges.</P>

            <P>(2) Where a lender does not timely request a hearing on a remedial action, <PRTPAGE P="452"/>the GSE shall take the action in accordance with the Notice.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Review and decision on remedial action(s).</E> (1) Where a lender timely requests a hearing on a remedial action, a hearing shall be conducted before a HUD administrative law judge (ALJ) and a final decision rendered in accordance with the procedures set forth in 24 CFR part 26, subpart B, to the extent such provisions are not inconsistent with subpart C of this part or FHEFSSA. The lender and the Secretary, but not the GSE, shall be parties to the action. At such hearing, the appropriateness of the remedial action for the violation(s) will be the sole matter for review. The validity or appropriateness of the underlying determination on the violation(s) shall not be subject to review at such hearing.</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary shall transmit to the GSEs each final decision by HUD on a remedial action and any dispositive settlement of a proceeding on such action.</P>
            <P>(3) The GSE shall take the action(s) set forth in a final decision by HUD on remedial action(s) or any dispositive settlement of such a proceeding setting forth remedial action(s) in accordance with such decision or settlement.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A GSE may request proprietary treatment of any mortgage data or AHAR information that the GSE submits to the Secretary. Such a request does not affect the GSE's responsibility to provide data or information required by the Secretary. Where the Secretary grants a request for proprietary treatment, HUD will not include the data or information in the public-use database or publicly disclose the data or information, except as otherwise provided in accordance with this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for proprietary treatment of mortgage data and AHAR information.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a GSE requesting proprietary treatment of mortgage data or AHAR information shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Clearly designate those portions of the mortgage data or AHAR information to be treated as proprietary, with a prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice, stating “Proprietary Information—Confidential Treatment Requested by [name of GSE]” on each page or portion of page to which the request applies. If such marking is impractical, the GSE shall attach to the mortgage data or information for which confidential treatment is requested a cover sheet prominently marked “Proprietary Information—Confidential Treatment Requested by [name of GSE];”</P>
            <P>(2) Accompany its request with a certification by an officer or authorized representative of the GSE that the mortgage data or information is proprietary; and</P>
            <P>(3) Submit any additional statements in support of proprietary designation that the GSE chooses to provide.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative procedure available for mortgage data or AHAR information subject to a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect.</E> When the request for proprietary treatment pertains to mortgage data or AHAR information that has been deemed proprietary by the Secretary under a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect, the GSE may reference such temporary order, final order, or regulation in lieu of complying with paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="457"/>

            <P>(1) The type of data or information involved and the nature of the adverse consequences to the GSE, financial or otherwise, that would result from disclosure, including any adverse effect on the GSE's competitive position;</P>
            <P>(2) The existence and applicability of any prior determinations by HUD, any other Federal agency, or a court, concerning similar data or information;</P>

            <P>(5) The difficulty that a competitor, including a seller/servicer, would face in obtaining or compiling the mortgage data or AHAR information; and</P>
            <P>(6) Such additional facts and legal and other authorities as the Secretary may consider appropriate, including the age of the mortgage data (see 24 CFR 81.75(b)(3)), or the extent to which particular mortgage data or AHAR information, when considered together with other information, could reveal proprietary information.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Alternative criterion for mortgage data or AHAR information subject to a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect.</E> Where the request for proprietary treatment pertains to mortgage data or AHAR information that has been deemed proprietary by the Secretary under a temporary order, final order, or regulation in effect, the Secretary shall grant the request with respect to any mortgage data or AHAR information which comes within the order or regulation.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of proprietary treatment.</E> The Secretary shall determine, as expeditiously as possible, whether mortgage data or AHAR information designated as proprietary by a GSE is proprietary information, or whether it is not proprietary and subject to inclusion in the public-use database and public release notwithstanding the GSE's request.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Action when according proprietary treatment to mortgage data and AHAR information.</E> (1) When the Secretary determines that mortgage data or AHAR information designated as proprietary by a GSE is proprietary, and the mortgage data or AHAR information is not subject to a temporary order, a final order, or a regulation in effect providing that the mortgage data or AHAR information is not subject to public disclosure, the Secretary shall notify the GSE that the request has been granted. In such cases, the Secretary shall issue either a temporary order, a final order, or a regulation providing that the mortgage data or information is not subject to public disclosure. Such a temporary order, final order, or regulation shall:</P>

            <P>(ii) Be provided to the GSE, made available to members of the public, and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> except that any portions of such order or regulation that would reveal the <PRTPAGE P="458"/>proprietary information shall be withheld from public disclosure. Publications of temporary orders shall invite public comments when feasible.</P>

            <P>(1) The Secretary shall provide the GSE with an opportunity for a meeting with HUD to discuss the matter, for the purpose of gaining additional information concerning the request.</P>
            <P>(2) Following the meeting, based on the Secretary's review of the mortgage data or AHAR information that is the subject of a request and the GSE's objections, if any, to disclosure of such mortgage data or AHAR information, the Secretary shall make a determination:</P>
            <P>(i) If the Secretary determines to withhold from the public-use database as proprietary the mortgage data or AHAR information that is the subject of a request, the procedures in paragraph (e) of this section shall apply; or</P>
            <P>(ii) If the Secretary determines that any mortgage data or AHAR information that is the subject of a request is not proprietary, the Secretary shall provide notice in writing to the GSE of the reasons for this determination, and such notice shall provide that the Secretary shall not release the mortgage data or AHAR information to the public for 10 working days.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Secretarial determination of proprietary classification.</E> Following a determination by the Secretary that mortgage data or AHAR information are proprietary information under FHEFSSA, the Secretary shall expeditiously issue a temporary order, final order, or regulation withholding the mortgage data or AHAR information from the public-use database and from public disclosure by HUD in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4546. The Secretary may, from time to time, by regulation or order, issue a list providing that certain mortgage data or AHAR information shall be treated as proprietary information.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Modification of proprietary classification</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Secretary may, based upon a consideration of the factors in § 81.74(b), modify a previous determination that mortgage data or AHAR information are proprietary information (and may also make conforming changes to the list designating certain mortgage data or AHAR information as proprietary information) by regulation, or by order using the procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Release of data following a modification of proprietary classification.</E> Following the Secretary's determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to modify a previous proprietary determination by reclassifying certain mortgage data as non-proprietary, the Secretary shall release the reclassified, non-proprietary mortgage data to the public both prospectively and for all prior years' public use databases, unless otherwise provided by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Release of aged data.</E> The Secretary may determine, through case-by-case consideration of individual data elements under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that certain mortgage data previously determined to be proprietary may lose their proprietary status if they are at least five years old (as measured from the end of the calendar year to which the mortgage data pertain). The Secretary will evaluate the age of the data as one of the relevant factors that may be considered under 24 CFR 81.74(b)(6). If the Secretary determines that such aged mortgage data have lost their proprietary status, these data shall be released publicly.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Release of aggregated data derived from proprietary loan-level data.</E> The <PRTPAGE P="459"/>Secretary may, based upon a consideration of the factors in § 81.74(b) and using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section, determine that certain aggregated data derived from proprietary loan-level mortgage data are not proprietary. If the Secretary makes such a determination, then the aggregated data shall be released to the public both prospectively and for all prior years, unless otherwise provided by the Secretary.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The following procedures apply to the Secretary's issuance of an order in connection with a determination under paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) The Secretary shall provide each GSE with written notice of the mortgage data, AHAR information or aggregated data proposed to be released, and an opportunity to submit written comments. The Secretary may also provide each GSE with an opportunity for a meeting with HUD to discuss the proposed release of mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data;</P>
            <P>(2) The Secretary shall make a determination regarding the proposed release of the GSE mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data based upon a consideration of the data or information under the standards set forth in 24 CFR 81.74(b) and the GSEs' written and oral objections, if any, to the proposed release of such mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data;</P>
            <P>(3) The Secretary shall provide notice in writing to each GSE of the Secretary's determination and the reasons under § 81.74(b) for his or her determination. If the Secretary determines that the mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data may be released, the notice will also provide that the Secretary shall not release the mortgage data, AHAR information, or aggregated data to the public for 10 working days;</P>

            <P>(4) The Secretary shall, no earlier than the end of the ten-working-day period referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, publish an order in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notifying the public of the Secretary's determination to release the mortgage data or AHAR information that has been reclassified as non-proprietary and/or to release certain non-proprietary aggregations of data derived from proprietary loan-level mortgage data. The order will also modify the list described in paragraph (a) of this section to reflect the Secretary's reclassification of the mortgage data or AHAR information. The Secretary shall omit from the published order any information that would reveal proprietary information.</P>

If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with all or any portion of a subpoena issued pursuant to this paragraph (f), the subpoenaing party or any other aggrieved person may petition the Secretary to seek enforcement of the subpoena.

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Filing documents under seal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request by party.</E> Upon the denial by the ALJ of a motion for a protective order, any party may request the Secretary to file any document or part of a document under seal if the party believes that disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. Any other party may file with the Secretary a reply to such a request within 5 working days after a request is made or some other time to be determined by <PRTPAGE P="465"/>the Secretary. Such requests and replies are governed by § 26.38 of this title.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of request.</E> A document or part of a document that is the subject of a timely request to the Secretary to file under seal will not be disclosed under this section until the Secretary has advised the parties and the ALJ, in writing, of the Secretary's decision on whether the document or part of a document should be filed under seal. The ALJ shall take all appropriate steps to preserve the confidentiality of such documents or parts of documents, including closing portions of the hearing to the public.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time of request.</E> Failure to file with the Secretary a timely request or a reply is deemed a waiver of any objection regarding the decision on whether a document is to be disclosed.

A request may be filed at any other time before or during the course of the hearing, but the requesting party's obligation to produce the document or parts of the document will not be affected by the party's pending request to the Secretary, unless the Secretary expressly directs the ALJ to treat the document as protected from disclosure until the Secretary makes a final written decision on whether the document should be filed under seal. If the Secretary's direction to the ALJ is made orally, that direction must be reduced to writing and filed with the ALJ within 3 working days of the making of the oral order or the document will then be subject to disclosure pending the Secretary's final written decision on disclosure.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained <PRTPAGE P="466"/>in this subpart H, the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars (but not including any choice of law provisions in the Security Documentation to the extent such provisions conflict with the Book-entry regulations contained in this subpart H):</P>
            <P>(1) The rights and obligations of a GSE and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:</P>
            <P>(i) A Book-entry GSE Security or Security Entitlement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to GSE Securities; and</P>

            <P>(i) A Book-entry GSE Security or Security Entitlement; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to GSE Securities;</P>
            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 81.93(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 81.93(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry GSE Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.</P>
            <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.</P>

            <P>(c)(1) A GSE and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, <PRTPAGE P="467"/>a GSE, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 81.92(b) or (d). The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor a GSE is liable to a Person asserting or having an adverse claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry GSE Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry GSE Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>
            <P>(b) The obligation of the GSE to make payments (including payments of interest and principal) with respect to Book-entry GSE Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Interest or other payments on Book-entry GSE Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.</P>
            <P>(2) Book-entry GSE Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both redemption proceeds, where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Bank or otherwise paying such redemption proceeds as directed by the Participant. No action by the Participant ordinarily is required in connection with the redemption of a Book-entry GSE Security.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Verification and enforcement to ensure GSE data integrity.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Independent verification authority.</E> The Secretary may independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the data, information, and reports provided by each GSE, including conducting on-site verification, when such steps are reasonably related to determining whether a GSE is complying with 12 U.S.C. 4541-4589 and the GSE's Charter Act.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certification.</E> (1) The senior officer of each GSE who is responsible for submitting to HUD the fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report and the AHAR under sections 309(m) and (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act or sections 307(e) and (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, as applicable, or for submitting to the Secretary such other report(s), data, or information for which certification is requested in writing by the Secretary, shall certify such report(s), data or information.</P>
            <P>(2) The certification shall state as follows: “To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided herein is true, correct and complete.”</P>
            <P>(3) If the Secretary determines that a GSE has failed to provide the certification required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, or that a GSE has provided the certification required by paragraph (b) in connection with data, information or report(s) that the Secretary later determines are not true, correct and complete, the Secretary may pursue the enforcement remedies under paragraph (e) of this section. For data, information or report(s) subject to paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may pursue the enforcement remedies described in paragraph (e) only in connection with material errors, omissions or discrepancies as those terms are defined in § 81.102(c) or (d).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Verification procedure and adjustment to correct errors, omissions or discrepancies in AHAR data for the immediately preceding year.</E> (1) This paragraph (c) pertains to the GSEs' submission of year-end data. For purposes of this paragraph, “year-end data” means data that HUD receives from the GSEs related to housing goals performance in the immediately preceding year and covering data reported in the fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report and the GSE's AHAR. An “error” means a technical mistake, such as a mistake in coding or calculating data. An “omission” means a GSE's failure to count units in the denominator. A “discrepancy” means any difference between HUD's analysis of data and the analysis contained in a GSE's submission of data, including a discrepancy in goal or Special Affordable subgoal performance.</P>
            <P>(2) If HUD finds errors, omissions or discrepancies in a GSE's year-end data submissions relative to HUD's regulations, HUD will first notify the GSE by telephone or e-mail transmission of each such error, omission or discrepancy. The GSE must respond within five working days of each such notification. HUD may, in its discretion or upon a request by a GSE within the five working day period, extend the response period for up to an additional 20 working days. Information exchanges during the five working day period following initial notification, and any subsequent extensions of time that may be granted, may be by electronic mail. Any person with delegated authority from the Secretary, or the Director of HUD's Financial Institution Regulation Division, or his or her designee, shall be responsible for issuing initial notifications regarding errors, omissions, or discrepancies; making determinations on the adequacy of responses received; approving any extensions of time permitted under this provision; and managing the data verification process.</P>

            <P>(3) If each error, omission or discrepancy is not resolved to HUD's satisfaction during the initial five working day period from notification, and any extension period, the Secretary will notify the GSE in writing and seek clarification or additional information to correct the error, omission or discrepancy. The GSE shall have 10 working days (or such longer period as the Secretary may establish, not to exceed 30 working days) from the date of the Secretary's written notice to respond in writing to the notice. If the GSE fails to submit a written response to the Secretary within this period, or if the Secretary determines that the GSE's <PRTPAGE P="470"/>written response fails to correct or otherwise resolve each error, omission or discrepancy in its reported year-end data to the Secretary's satisfaction, the Secretary will determine the appropriate adjustments to the numerator and the denominator of the applicable housing goal(s) and Special Affordable subgoal(s) due to the GSE's failure to provide the Secretary with accurate submissions of data.</P>
            <P>(4) The Secretary, or his or her designee, shall inform a GSE in writing, at least five working days prior to HUD's release of its official performance figures to the public, of HUD's determination of official goals performance figures, including any adjustments. During the five working days prior to such public release, a GSE may request, in writing, a reconsideration of HUD's final determination of its performance and must provide the basis for requesting the reconsideration. If the request is granted, the Secretary will consider the GSE's request for reconsideration of its determination of goals performance and make a final determination regarding the GSE's performance, within 10 working days of the Secretary's granting of the GSE's written request for reconsideration.</P>
            <P>(5) Should the Secretary determine that additional enforcement action against the GSE is warranted for material errors, omissions or discrepancies with regard to a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal, it may pursue additional remedies under paragraph (e) of this section. An error, omission or discrepancy is material if it results in an overstatement of credit for a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal, and, without such overstatement, the GSE would have failed to meet such housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal for the immediately preceding year.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Adjustment to correct prior year reporting errors, omissions or discrepancies</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The Secretary may require a GSE to correct a material error, omission or discrepancy in a GSE's prior year's data reported in the fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report and the GSE's AHAR under sections 309(m) and (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act or sections 307(e) and (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, as applicable. An error, omission or discrepancy is material if it results in an overstatement of credit for a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal and, without such overstatement, the GSE would have failed to meet such housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal for the prior year. A “prior year” for purposes of this section is any one of the two years immediately preceding the latest year for which data on housing goals performance was reported to HUD.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedural requirements.</E> In the event the Secretary determines that a GSE's prior year's fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR contain a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Secretary will provide the GSE with an initial letter containing written findings and determinations within 24 months of the end of the relevant GSE reporting year. The GSE shall have an opportunity, not to exceed 30 days from the date of receipt of the Secretary's initial letter, to respond in writing with supporting documentation, to contest the Secretary's initial determination that there was a material error, omission or discrepancy in a prior year's data. The Secretary shall then issue a final determination letter within 60 days of the date of HUD's receipt of the GSE's written response or, if no response is received, within 90 days of the date of the GSE's receipt of the Secretary's initial letter. The Secretary may extend the period for issuing a final determination letter by an additional 30 days and may grant the GSE an opportunity, for a period not to exceed 10 working days from the date of the GSE's receipt of the determination letter to request that the determination be reconsidered.</P>

            <P>(3) If the Secretary determines that a GSE's prior year's fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR contained a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Secretary may direct the GSE to correct the overstatement by purchasing mortgages to finance the number of units that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year's goal performance (or, for the Special Affordable subgoal, the number or dollar amount, as applicable, of mortgage purchases that HUD has determined were overstated), or that <PRTPAGE P="471"/>equal the percentage of the overstatement in the prior year's goal or Special Affordable subgoal performance as applied to the most current year-end performance, whichever is less. Units or mortgages purchased to remedy an overstatement in the housing goals or the Special Affordable subgoal must be eligible to qualify under the same goal or Special Affordable subgoal that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year.</P>
            <P>(4) If a GSE does not purchase a sufficient amount or type of mortgages to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section as directed by the Secretary by no later than the end of the calendar year immediately following the year in which the Secretary notifies the GSE of such overstatement (unless, upon written request from the GSE, the Secretary, in his or her discretion, determines that a grant of additional time is appropriate to correct or compensate for the overstatement) the Department may pursue any or all of the following remedies:</P>
            <P>(i) Issue a notice that the GSE has failed a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal in the prior year;</P>
            <P>(ii) Seek additional enforcement remedies under paragraph (e) of this section;</P>
            <P>(iii) Pursue any other civil or administrative remedies as are available to it.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional enforcement options</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> In the event the Secretary determines, either as a result of his or her independent verification authority described in paragraph (a) of this section, or by the authority set forth in paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, that any of the following circumstances has occurred with respect to data, information or report(s) required by sections 309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act, sections 307(e) or (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, or subpart E of this part, the Secretary may regard this as a GSE's failure to submit such data, information or report(s) and, accordingly, the Secretary may take the additional enforcement actions authorized by paragraph (e)(2) of this section:</P>
            <P>(i) A GSE fails to submit the certification required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section in connection with such data, information or report(s); or</P>
            <P>(ii) A GSE submits the certification required by paragraph (b) of this section, but the Secretary later determines that the data, information or report(s) are not true, correct and complete. For data, information or report(s) subject to paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may pursue the additional enforcement remedies under paragraph (e)(2) only in connection with material errors, omissions or discrepancies, as those terms are defined in § 81.102(c) or (d). In addition, the Secretary may only pursue such remedies in connection with material errors, omissions or discrepancies arising under paragraph (d) of this section if the GSE has failed to purchase a sufficient amount or type of mortgages, as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Remedies.</E> (i) <E T="03">Submissions required under the GSE's charter acts.</E> After the Secretary makes a determination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section that any of the circumstances described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) or (ii) has occurred with respect to data, information, or report(s) required by sections 309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act, or by sections 307(e) or (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, the Secretary may pursue any or all of the following remedies in accordance with paragraph (e)(3), or applicable law, as appropriate:</P>
            <P>(A) A cease-and-desist order against the GSE for failing to submit the required data, information or report(s) in accordance with this section;</P>
            <P>(B) Civil money penalties against the GSE for failing to submit the required data, information or report(s) in accordance with this section;</P>
            <P>(C) Any other civil or administrative remedies or penalties against the GSE that may be available to the Secretary by virtue of the GSE's failing to submit or certify the required data, information or report(s) in accordance with this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Submissions required under subpart E of this part.</E> After the Secretary makes a determination under paragraph (e)(1) of this section that any of the circumstances described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) or (ii) has occurred with <PRTPAGE P="472"/>respect to data, information or report(s) required under subpart E of this part (but that are not required by sections 309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act or by sections 307(e) or (f) of the Freddie Mac Act), the Secretary may pursue any civil or administrative remedies or penalties against the GSE that may be available to the Secretary. The Secretary shall pursue such remedies under applicable law.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The Secretary shall comply with the procedures set forth in subpart G of this part in connection with any enforcement action that he or she may initiate against a GSE under paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.</P>
            <P>(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional and technical services.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 87.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>
            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <E T="03">professional and technical services</E> shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a <PRTPAGE P="477"/>professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>
            <P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.</P>

            <P>(b) The reporting requirements in § 87.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.</P>

            <P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B of this part) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $20,134 and not more than $201,340 for each such failure.</P>
            <P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.</P>
            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $20,134, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $20,134 and $201,340 as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Overall goals.</E> (1) The overall goal of the community planning and development programs covered by this part is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities principally for low- and moderate-income persons. The primary means towards this end is to extend and strengthen partnerships among all levels of government and the private sector, including for-profit and non-profit organizations, in the production and operation of affordable housing.</P>

            <P>(i) Decent housing includes assisting homeless persons to obtain appropriate housing and assisting persons at risk of becoming homeless; retention of the affordable housing stock; and increasing the availability of permanent housing in standard condition and affordable cost to low-income and moderate-income families, particularly to members of disadvantaged minorities, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. Decent housing also includes increasing the supply of supportive housing, which combines structural features and services needed to enable persons with special needs, including persons with HIV/AIDS and their families, to live with dignity and independence; and providing housing affordable to low-income persons accessible to job opportunities.<PRTPAGE P="485"/>
            </P>
            <P>(ii) A suitable living environment includes improving the safety and livability of neighborhoods; increasing access to quality public and private facilities and services; reducing the isolation of income groups within a community or geographical area through the spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income and the revitalization of deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods; restoring and preserving properties of special historic, architectural, or aesthetic value; and conservation of energy resources.</P>
            <P>(iii) Expanded economic opportunities includes job creation and retention; establishment, stabilization and expansion of small businesses (including microbusinesses); the provision of public services concerned with employment; the provision of jobs involved in carrying out activities under programs covered by this plan to low-income persons living in areas affected by those programs and activities; availability of mortgage financing for low-income persons at reasonable rates using nondiscriminatory lending practices; access to capital and credit for development activities that promote the long-term economic and social viability of the community; and empowerment and self-sufficiency opportunities for low-income persons to reduce generational poverty in federally assisted and public housing.</P>
            <P>(2) The consolidated submission described in this part 91 requires the jurisdiction to state in one document its plan to pursue these goals for all the community planning and development programs, as well as for housing programs. It is these goals against which the plan and the jurisdiction's performance under the plan will be evaluated by HUD.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Functions of plan.</E> The consolidated plan serves the following functions:</P>
            <P>(1) A planning document for the jurisdiction, which builds on a participatory process among citizens, organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders;</P>
            <P>(2) A submission for federal funds under HUD's formula grant programs for jurisdictions;</P>
            <P>(3) A strategy to be followed in carrying out HUD programs; and</P>
            <P>(4) A management tool for assessing performance and tracking results.</P>

(But see § 92.104 of this subtitle with respect to newly eligible jurisdictions under the HOME program.) With the exception of the August 16 date noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD may grant a jurisdiction an extension of the submission deadline for good cause.</P>
            <P>(2) In no event will HUD accept a submission earlier than November 15 or later than August 16 of the federal fiscal year for which the grant funds are appropriated. Failure to receive the plan by August 16 will automatically result in a loss of the CDBG funds to which the jurisdiction would otherwise be entitled.</P>
            <P>(3) A jurisdiction may have a program year that coincides with the federal fiscal year (e.g., October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006, for federal fiscal year 2006 funds). However, the consolidated plan may not be submitted earlier than November 15 of the federal fiscal year and HUD has the period specified in § 91.500 to review the consolidated plan.</P>

            <P>(2) When preparing the portions of the consolidated plan describing the jurisdiction's homeless strategy and the resources available to address the needs of homeless persons (particularly chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) and persons at risk of homelessness, the jurisdiction must consult with:</P>
            <P>(i) The Continuum(s) of Care that serve(s) the jurisdiction's geographic area;</P>
            <P>(ii) Public and private agencies that address housing, health, social service, victim services, employment, or education needs of low-income individuals and families; homeless individuals and families, including homeless veterans; youth; and/or other persons with special needs;</P>
            <P>(iii) Publicly funded institutions and systems of care that may discharge persons into homelessness (such as health-care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); and</P>
            <P>(iv) Business and civic leaders.</P>
            <P>(3) When preparing the portion of its consolidated plan concerning lead-based paint hazards, the jurisdiction shall consult with state or local health and child welfare agencies and examine existing data related to lead-based paint hazards and poisonings, including health department data on the addresses of housing units in which children have been identified as lead poisoned.</P>
            <P>(4) When preparing the description of priority nonhousing community development needs, a unit of general local government must notify adjacent units of general local government, to the extent practicable. The nonhousing community development plan must be submitted to the state, and, if the jurisdiction is a CDBG entitlement grantee other than an urban county, to the county.</P>

            <P>(5) The jurisdiction also should consult with adjacent units of general local government and local and regional government agencies, including local government agencies with metropolitan-wide planning and transportation responsibilities, particularly for <PRTPAGE P="492"/>problems and solutions that go beyond a single jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">HOPWA.</E> The largest city in each eligible metropolitan statistical area (EMSA) that is eligible to receive a HOPWA formula allocation must consult broadly to develop a metropolitan-wide strategy for addressing the needs of persons with HIV/AIDS and their families living throughout the EMSA. All jurisdictions within the EMSA must assist the jurisdiction that is applying for a HOPWA allocation in the preparation of the HOPWA submission.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Public housing agencies (PHAs).</E> (1) The jurisdiction shall consult with local PHAs operating in the jurisdiction regarding consideration of public housing needs, planned programs and activities, the AFH, strategies for affirmatively furthering fair housing, and proposed actions to affirmatively further fair housing in the consolidated plan. (See also 24 CFR 5.158 for coordination when preparing an AFH jointly with a PHA.) This consultation will help provide a better basis for the certification by the authorized official that the PHA Plan is consistent with the consolidated plan and the local government's description of its strategy for affirmatively furthering fair housing and the manner in which it will address the needs of public housing and, where necessary, the manner in which it will provide financial or other assistance to a troubled PHA to improve the PHA's operations and remove the designation of troubled, as well as obtaining PHA input on addressing fair housing issues in the Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs.</P>
            <P>(2) This consultation will also help ensure that activities with regard to affirmatively furthering fair housing, local drug elimination, neighborhood improvement programs, and resident programs and services, those funded under a PHA's program and those funded under a program covered by the consolidated plan, are fully coordinated to achieve comprehensive community development goals and affirmatively further fair housing. If a PHA is required to implement remedies under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, the local jurisdiction should work with or consult with the PHA, as appropriate, to identify actions the jurisdiction may take, if any, to assist the PHA in implementing the required remedies. A local jurisdiction may use CDBG funds for eligible activities or other funds to implement remedies required under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG). A jurisdiction that receives an ESG grant must consult with the Continuum of Care in determining how to allocate its ESG grant for eligible activities; in developing the performance standards for, and evaluating the outcomes of, projects and activities assisted by ESG funds; and in developing funding, policies, and procedures for the operation and administration of the HMIS.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.</E> (1) The jurisdiction shall consult with community-based and regionally-based organizations that represent protected class members, and organizations that enforce fair housing laws, such as State or local fair housing enforcement agencies (including participants in the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP)), fair housing organizations and other nonprofit organizations that receive funding under the Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP), and other public and private fair housing service agencies, to the extent that such entities operate within its jurisdiction. This consultation will help provide a better basis for the jurisdiction's AFH, its certification to affirmatively further fair housing, and other portions of the consolidated plan concerning affirmatively furthering fair housing.</P>
            <P>(2) This consultation must occur with any organizations that have relevant knowledge or data to inform the AFH and that are sufficiently independent and representative to provide meaningful feedback to a jurisdiction on the AFH, the consolidated plan, and their implementation.</P>

            <P>(3) Consultation must occur at various points in the fair housing planning process, meaning that, at a minimum, the jurisdiction will consult with the organizations described in this paragraph (e) in the development of both the AFH and the consolidated plan. Consultation on the consolidated plan shall specifically seek input into how the goals identified in an accepted AFH <PRTPAGE P="493"/>inform the priorities and objectives of the consolidated plan.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability and adoption of the citizen participation plan.</E> (1) The jurisdiction is required to adopt a citizen participation plan that sets forth the jurisdiction's policies and procedures for citizen participation. (Where a jurisdiction, before August 17, 2015, adopted a citizen participation plan it, will need to amend the citizen participation plan to comply with provisions of this section.)</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Encouragement of citizen participation.</E> (i) The citizen participation plan must provide for and encourage citizens to participate in the development of the AFH, any revisions to the AFH, the consolidated plan, any substantial amendment to the consolidated plan, and the performance report. These requirements are designed especially to encourage participation by low- and moderate-income persons, particularly those persons living in areas designated by the jurisdiction as a revitalization area or in a slum and blighted area and in areas where CDBG funds are proposed to be used, and by residents of predominantly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, as defined by the jurisdiction. A jurisdiction must take appropriate actions to encourage the participation of all its citizens, including minorities and non-English speaking persons, as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as well as persons with disabilities.</P>
            <P>(ii) The jurisdiction shall encourage the participation of local and regional institutions, Continuums of Care, and other organizations (including businesses, developers, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, and community-based and faith-based organizations) in the process of developing and implementing the AFH and the consolidated plan. The jurisdiction shall encourage the participation of public and private organizations. Commencing with consolidated plans submitted on or after January 1, 2018, such consultations shall include broadband internet service providers, organizations engaged in narrowing the digital divide, agencies whose primary responsibilities include the management of flood prone areas, public land or water resources, and emergency management agencies in the process of developing the consolidated plan.</P>
            <P>(iii) The jurisdiction shall encourage, in conjunction with consultation with public housing agencies, the participation of residents of public and assisted housing developments (including any resident advisory boards, resident councils, and resident management corporations) in the process of developing and implementing the AFH and the consolidated plan, along with other low-income residents of targeted revitalization areas in which the developments are located. The jurisdictions shall make an effort to provide information to the PHA about the AFH, AFFH strategy, and consolidated plan activities related to its developments and surrounding communities so that the PHA can make this information available at the annual public hearing(s) required for the PHA Plan.</P>

            <P>(iv) The jurisdiction should explore alternative public involvement techniques and quantitative ways to measure efforts that encourage citizen participation in a shared vision for change in communities and neighborhoods, and the review of program performance; <E T="03">e.g.,</E> use of focus groups and the Internet.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Citizen comment on the citizen participation plan and amendments.</E> The jurisdiction must provide citizens with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the original citizen participation plan and on substantial amendments to the citizen participation plan, and must make the citizen participation plan public. The citizen participation plan must be in a format accessible to persons with disabilities, upon request.</P>

            <P>(4) The citizen participation plan shall describe the jurisdiction's procedures for assessing its language needs and identify any need for translation of notices and other vital documents.

The jurisdiction may make the HUD-provided data available to the public by cross-referencing to the data on HUD's Web site.</P>
            <P>(ii) The citizen participation plan must require that, before the jurisdiction adopts a consolidated plan, the jurisdiction will make available to residents, public agencies, and other interested parties information that includes the amount of assistance the jurisdiction expects to receive (including grant funds and program income) and the range of activities that may be undertaken, including the estimated amount that will benefit persons of low- and moderate-income. The citizen participation plan also must set forth the jurisdiction's plans to minimize displacement of persons and to assist any persons displaced, specifying the types and levels of assistance the jurisdiction will make available (or require others to make available) to persons displaced, even if the jurisdiction expects no displacement to occur.</P>
            <P>(iii) The citizen participation plan must state when and how the jurisdiction will make this information available.</P>
            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan must require the jurisdiction to publish the proposed AFH and the proposed consolidated plan in a manner that affords its residents, public agencies, and other interested parties a reasonable opportunity to examine its content and to submit comments. The citizen participation plan must set forth how the jurisdiction will publish the proposed AFH and the proposed consolidated plan and give reasonable opportunity to examine each document's content. The requirement for publishing may be met by publishing a summary of each document in one or more newspapers of general circulation, and by making copies of each document available on the Internet, on the jurisdiction's official government Web site, and as well at libraries, government offices, and public places. The summary must describe the content and purpose of the AFH or the consolidated plan (as applicable), and must include a list of the locations where copies of the entire proposed document may be examined. In addition, the jurisdiction must provide a reasonable number of free copies of the plan or the AFH (as applicable) to residents and groups that request it.</P>
            <P>(3) The citizen participation plan must provide for at least one public hearing during the development of the AFH or the consolidated plan (as applicable). See paragraph (e) of this section for public hearing requirements, generally.</P>
            <P>(4) The citizen participation plan must provide a period, not less than 30 calendar days, to receive comments from residents of the community on the consolidated plan or the AFH (as applicable).</P>
            <P>(5) The citizen participation plan shall require the jurisdiction to consider any comments or views of residents of the community received in writing, or orally at the public hearings, in preparing the final AFH or the final consolidated plan (as applicable). A summary of these comments or views, and a summary of any comments or views not accepted and the reasons why, shall be attached to the final AFH or the final consolidated plan (as applicable).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consolidated plan amendments and AFH revisions</E>—(1)(i) <E T="03">Criteria for amendment to consolidated plan.</E> The citizen participation plan must specify the criteria the jurisdiction will use for determining what changes in the jurisdiction's planned or actual activities constitute a substantial amendment to the consolidated plan.

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Criteria for revision to the AFH.</E> The jurisdiction must specify the criteria the jurisdiction will use for determining when revisions to the AFH will be required. (At a minimum, the specified criteria must include the situations described in 24 CFR 5.164.)</P>
            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan must provide community residents with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on substantial amendments to the consolidated plan and revisions to the AFH. The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given. The citizen participation plan must provide a period, of not less than 30 calendar days, to receive comments on the consolidated plan substantial amendment or any revision to the AFH before the consolidated plan substantial amendment is implemented or the revised AFH is submitted to HUD for review.</P>
            <P>(3) The citizen participation plan shall require the jurisdiction to consider any comments or views of residents of the community received in writing, or orally at public hearings, if any, in preparing the substantial amendment of the consolidated plan or significant revision to the AFH (as applicable). A summary of these comments or views, and a summary of any comments or views not accepted and the reasons why, shall be attached to the substantial amendment of the consolidated plan or revision to the AFH (as applicable).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Performance reports.</E> (1) The citizen participation plan must provide citizens with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on performance reports. The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given. The citizen participation plan must provide a period, not less than 15 days, to receive comments on the performance report that is to be submitted to HUD before its submission.</P>
            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan shall require the jurisdiction to consider any comments or views of citizens received in writing, or orally at public hearings in preparing the performance report. A summary of these comments or views shall be attached to the performance report.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Public hearings</E>—(1)(i) <E T="03">Consolidated plan.</E> The citizen participation plan must provide for at least two public hearings per year to obtain residents' views and to respond to proposals and questions, to be conducted at a minimum of two different stages of the program year. Together, the hearings must address housing and community development needs, development of proposed activities, proposed strategies and actions for affirmatively furthering fair housing consistent with the AFH, and a review of program performance.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Minimum number of hearings.</E> To obtain the views of residents of the community on housing and community development needs, including priority nonhousing community development needs and affirmatively furthering fair housing, the citizen participation plan must provide that at least one of these hearings is held before the proposed consolidated plan is published for comment.</P>

            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan must state how and when adequate advance notice will be given to citizens of each hearing, with sufficient information published about the subject of the hearing to permit informed comment. (Publishing small print notices in the newspaper a few days before the hearing does not constitute adequate notice. Although HUD is not specifying the length of notice required, it would consider two weeks adequate.)</P>

            <P>(3) The citizen participation plan must provide that hearings be held at times and locations convenient to potential and actual beneficiaries, and with accommodation for persons with disabilities. The citizen participation plan must specify how it will meet these requirements.<PRTPAGE P="496"/>

The assistance need not include the provision of funds to the groups.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Complaints.</E> The citizen participation plan shall describe the jurisdiction's appropriate and practicable procedures to handle complaints from its residents related to the consolidated plan, amendments, AFH, revisions, and the performance report.

            <SUBJECT>Consultation; States.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) When preparing the AFH and the consolidated plan, the State shall consult with public and private agencies that provide assisted housing (including any State housing agency administering public housing), health services, social services (including those focusing on services to children, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, persons with HIV/AIDS and their families, and homeless persons), and State-based and regionally-based organizations that represent protected class members and organizations that enforce fair housing laws during preparation of the consolidated plan.</P>

            <P>(1) With respect to public housing or Housing Choice Voucher programs, the State shall consult with any housing agency administering public housing or the section 8 program on a Statewide basis as well as all PHAs that certify consistency with the State's consolidated plan. State consultation with these entities may consider public housing needs, planned programs and activities, the AFH, strategies for affirmatively furthering fair housing, and proposed actions to affirmatively further fair housing. This consultation helps provide a better basis for the certification by the authorized official <PRTPAGE P="497"/>that the PHA Plan is consistent with the consolidated plan and the State's description of its strategy for affirmatively furthering fair housing, and the manner in which the State will address the needs of public housing and, where applicable, the manner in which the State may provide financial or other assistance to a troubled PHA to improve its operations and remove such designation, as well as in obtaining PHA input on addressing fair housing issues in public housing and the Housing Choice Voucher programs. This consultation also helps ensure that activities with regard to affirmatively furthering fair housing, local drug elimination, neighborhood improvement programs, and resident programs and services, funded under a PHA's program and those funded under a program covered by the consolidated plan, are fully coordinated to achieve comprehensive community development goals and affirmatively further fair housing. If a PHA is required to implement remedies under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, the State should consult with the PHA and identify actions the State may take, if any, to assist the PHA in implementing the required remedies.</P>
            <P>(2) The State shall consult with State-based and regionally-based organizations that represent protected class members, and organizations that enforce fair housing laws, such as State fair housing enforcement agencies (including participants in the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP)), fair housing organizations and other nonprofit organizations that receive funding under the Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP), and other public and private fair housing service agencies, to the extent such entities operate within the State. This consultation will help provide a better basis for the State's AFH, its certification to affirmatively further fair housing, and other portions of the consolidated plan concerning affirmatively furthering fair housing. This consultation should occur with organizations that have the capacity to engage with data informing the AFH and be sufficiently independent and representative to provide meaningful feedback on the AFH, the consolidated plan, and their implementation. Consultation must occur at various points in the fair housing planning process, meaning that, at a minimum, the jurisdiction will consult with the organizations described in this paragraph (a)(2) in the development of both the AFH and the consolidated plan. Consultation on the consolidated plan shall specifically seek input into how the goals identified in an accepted AFH inform the priorities and objectives of the consolidated plan. When preparing the consolidated plan, the State shall also consult with public and private organizations. Commencing with consolidated plans submitted on or after January 1, 2018, such consultations shall include broadband internet service providers, organizations engaged in narrowing the digital divide, agencies whose primary responsibilities include the management of flood prone areas, public land or water resources, and emergency management agencies.</P>
            <P>(b) When preparing the portions of the consolidated plan describing the State's homeless strategy and the resources available to address the needs of homeless persons (particularly chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) and persons at risk of homelessness, the State must consult with:</P>
            <P>(1) Each Continuum of Care within the state;</P>
            <P>(2) Public and private agencies that address housing, health, social services, victim services, employment, or education needs of low-income individuals and families; of homeless individuals and families, including homeless veterans; youth; and/or of other persons with special needs;</P>
            <P>(3) Publicly funded institutions and systems of care that may discharge persons into homelessness (such as health-care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions); and</P>
            <P>(4) Business and civic leaders.</P>

            <P>(c) When preparing the portion of its consolidated plan concerning lead-based paint hazards, the State shall consult with state or local health and child welfare agencies and examine existing data related to lead-based paint <PRTPAGE P="498"/>hazards and poisonings, including health department data on the addresses of housing units in which children have been identified as lead-poisoned.</P>
            <P>(d) When preparing its method of distribution of assistance under the CDBG program, a State must consult with local governments in nonentitlement areas of the state.</P>
            <P>(e) The State must also consult with each Continuum of Care within the state in determining how to allocate its ESG grant for eligible activities; developing the performance standards for, and evaluating the outcomes of, projects and activities assisted by ESG funds; and developing funding, policies, and procedures for the operation and administration of the HMIS.</P>

The citizen participation plan must set forth how the State will make publicly available the proposed AFH and the proposed consolidated plan and give reasonable opportunity to examine each document's content. To ensure that the AFH, the consolidated plan, and the PHA plan are informed by meaningful community participation, program participants should employ communications means designed to reach the broadest audience. Such communications may be met by publishing a summary of each document in one or more newspapers of general circulation, and by making copies of each document available on the Internet, on the grantee's official government Web site, and as well at libraries, government offices, and public places. The summary must describe the content and purpose of the AFH or the consolidated plan (as applicable), and must include a list of the locations where copies of the entire proposed document(s) may be examined. In addition, the State must provide a reasonable number of free copies of the plan or the AFH (as applicable) to its residents and groups that request a copy of the plan or the AFH.</P>
            <P>(3) The citizen participation plan must provide for at least one public hearing on housing and community development needs and proposed strategies and actions for affirmatively furthering fair housing consistent with the AFH, before the proposed consolidated plan is published for comment. To obtain the public's views on AFH-related data and affirmatively furthering fair housing in the State's housing and community development programs, the citizen participation plan must provide that at least one public hearing is held before the proposed AFH is published for comment.</P>
            <P>(i) The citizen participation plan must state how and when adequate advance notice of the hearing will be given to residents, with sufficient information published about the subject of the hearing to permit informed comment. (Publishing small print notices in the newspaper a few days before the hearing does not constitute adequate notice. Although HUD is not specifying the length of notice required, HUD would consider 2 weeks adequate.)</P>
            <P>(ii) The citizen participation plan must provide that the hearing be held at a time and accessible location convenient to potential and actual beneficiaries, and with accommodation for persons with disabilities. The citizen participation plan must specify how it will meet these requirements.</P>

            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Criteria for revision to the AFH.</E> The State must specify the criteria it will use for determining when revision to the AFH will be appropriate. (At a minimum, the specified criteria must include the situations described in 24 CFR 5.164.)</P>
            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan must provide residents and units of general local government with reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment on consolidated plan substantial amendments and any revision to the AFH. The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given. The citizen participation plan must provide a period, of not less than 30 calendar days, to receive comments on the consolidated plan substantial amendment or revision to the AFH before the consolidated plan substantial amendment is implemented or the revised AFH is submitted to HUD.</P>
            <P>(3) The citizen participation plan shall require the State to consider any comments or views of its residents and units of general local government received in writing, or orally at public hearings, if any, in preparing the substantial amendment of the consolidated plan or revision to the AFH (as applicable).

The citizen participation plan must state how reasonable notice and an opportunity to comment will be given. The citizen participation plan must provide a period, not less than 15 days, to receive comments on the performance report that is to be submitted to HUD before its submission.</P>
            <P>(2) The citizen participation plan shall require the state to consider any comments or views of citizens received in writing, or orally at public hearings in preparing the performance report. A summary of these comments or views shall be attached to the performance report.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Housing and homeless needs assessment.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the jurisdiction's estimated housing needs projected for the ensuing five-year period. Housing data included in this portion of the plan shall be based on U.S. Census data, as provided by HUD, as updated by any properly conducted local study, or any other reliable source that the jurisdiction clearly <PRTPAGE P="502"/>identifies, and should reflect the consultation with social service agencies and other entities conducted in accordance with § 91.100 and the citizen participation process conducted in accordance with § 91.105. For a jurisdiction seeking funding on behalf of an eligible metropolitan statistical area under the HOPWA program, the needs described for housing and supportive services must address the unmet needs of low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families throughout the eligible metropolitan statistical area.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Categories of persons affected.</E> (1)(i) The plan shall estimate the number and type of families in need of housing assistance for:</P>
            <P>(A) Extremely low-income, low-income, moderate-income, and middle-income families;</P>
            <P>(B) Renters and owners;</P>
            <P>(C) Elderly persons;</P>
            <P>(D) Single persons;</P>
            <P>(E) Large families;</P>
            <P>(F) Public housing residents;</P>
            <P>(G) Families on the public housing and Section 8 tenant-based waiting list;</P>
            <P>(H) Persons with HIV/AIDS and their families;</P>
            <P>(I) Victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking;</P>
            <P>(J) Persons with disabilities; and</P>
            <P>(K) Formerly homeless families and individuals who are receiving rapid re-housing assistance and are nearing the termination of that assistance.</P>
            <P>(ii) The description of housing needs shall include a concise summary of the cost burden and severe cost burden, overcrowding (especially for large families), and substandard housing conditions being experienced by extremely low-income, low-income, moderate-income, and middle-income renters and owners compared to the jurisdiction as a whole. (The jurisdiction must define in its consolidated plan the terms “standard condition” and “substandard condition but suitable for rehabilitation.”)</P>
            <P>(2) Until the jurisdiction has submitted an AFH, which includes an assessment of disproportionate housing needs in accordance with 24 CFR 5.154(d)(2)(iv), the following assessment shall continue to be included in the consolidated plan. For any of the income categories enumerated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that any racial or ethnic group has disproportionately greater need in comparison to the needs of that category as a whole, assessment of that specific need shall be included. For this purpose, disproportionately greater need exists when the percentage of persons in a category of need who are members of a particular racial or ethnic group in a category of need is at least 10 percentage points higher than the percentage of persons in the category as a whole. Once the jurisdiction has submitted an AFH, however, this assessment need not be included in the consolidated plan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Persons who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.</E> (1) The plan must describe, in a form prescribed by HUD, the nature and extent of unsheltered and sheltered homelessness, including rural homelessness, within the jurisdiction. At a minimum, the recipient must use data from the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) and data from the Point-In-Time (PIT) count conducted in accordance with HUD standards.</P>
            <P>(i) The description must include, for each category of homeless persons specified by HUD (including chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth), the number of persons experiencing homelessness on a given night, the number of persons who experience homelessness each year, the number of persons who lose their housing and become homeless each year, the number of persons who exit homelessness each year, the number of days that persons experience homelessness, and other measures specified by HUD.</P>
            <P>(ii) The plan also must contain a brief narrative description of the nature and extent of homelessness by racial and ethnic group, to the extent information is available.</P>

            <P>(2) The plan must include a narrative description of the characteristics and needs of low-income individuals and families with children (especially extremely low-income) who are currently <PRTPAGE P="503"/>housed but threatened with homelessness. This information may be evidenced by the characteristics and needs of individuals and families with children who are currently entering the homeless assistance system or appearing for the first time on the streets. The description must also specify particular housing characteristics that have been linked with instability and an increased risk of homelessness.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other special needs.</E> (1) The jurisdiction shall estimate, to the extent practicable, the number of persons who are not homeless but require supportive housing, including the elderly, frail elderly, persons with disabilities (mental, physical, developmental), persons with alcohol or other drug addiction, persons with HIV/AIDS and their families, public housing residents, and any other categories the jurisdiction may specify, and describe their supportive housing needs.</P>
            <P>(2) With respect to a jurisdiction seeking funding on behalf of an eligible metropolitan statistical area under the HOPWA program, the plan must identify the size and characteristics of the population with HIV/AIDS and their families within the eligible metropolitan statistical area it will serve.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Lead-based paint hazards.</E> The plan must estimate the number of housing units within the jurisdiction that are occupied by low-income families or moderate-income families that contain lead-based paint hazards, as defined in this part.</P>

            <P>(2) Data on the housing market should include, to the extent information is available, an estimate of the number of vacant or abandoned buildings and whether units in these buildings are suitable for rehabilitation.</P>
            <P>(3) The jurisdiction must also identify and describe any areas within the jurisdiction with concentrations of racial/ethnic minorities and/or low-income families, stating how it defines the terms “area of low-income concentration” and “area of minority concentration” for this purpose. The locations and degree of these concentrations must be identified, either in a narrative or on one or more maps.</P>
            <P>(4) Commencing with consolidated plans submitted on or after January 1, 2018, the jurisdiction must also describe the broadband needs of housing occupied by low- and moderate-income households based on an analysis of data, identified by the jurisdiction, for its low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. These needs include the need for broadband wiring and for connection to the broadband service in the household units and the need for increased competition by having more than one broadband Internet service provider serve the jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(5) Commencing with consolidated plans submitted on or after January 1, 2018, the jurisdiction must also describe the vulnerability of housing occupied by low- and moderate-income households to increased natural hazard risks associated with climate change based on an analysis of data, findings, and methods identified by the jurisdiction in its consolidated plan.</P>

            <P>(2) The inventory of services must include both services targeted to homeless persons and mainstream services, such as health, mental health, and employment services to the extent those services are used to complement services targeted to homeless persons.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Special need facilities and services.</E> The plan must describe, to the extent information is available, the facilities and services that assist persons who are not homeless but who require supportive housing, and programs for ensuring that persons returning from mental and physical health institutions receive appropriate supportive housing.</P>

            <P>(i) With respect to activities expected to be assisted with CDBG funds, the Action Plan has been developed so as to give the maximum feasible priority to activities that will benefit low- and moderate-income families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. The plan may also include CDBG-assisted activities that are certified to be designed to meet other community development needs having particular urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs;</P>
            <P>(ii) The aggregate use of CDBG funds, including section 108 guaranteed loans, during a period specified by the jurisdiction, consisting of one, two, or three specific consecutive program years, shall principally benefit low- and moderate-income families in a manner that ensures that at least 70 percent of the amount is expended for activities that benefit such persons during the designated period (see 24 CFR 570.3 for definition of “CDBG funds”); and</P>

However, if CDBG funds are used to pay the proportion of a fee or assessment attributable to the capital costs of public improvements (assisted in part with CDBG funds) financed from other revenue sources, an assessment or charge may be made against the property with respect to the public improvements financed by a source other than CDBG funds. In addition, with respect to properties owned and occupied by moderate-income (but not low-income) families, an assessment or charge may be made against the property with respect to the public improvements financed by a source other than CDBG funds if the jurisdiction certifies that it lacks CDBG funds to cover the assessment.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Special case; abbreviated consolidated plan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may submit an abbreviated plan?</E> A jurisdiction that is not a CDBG entitlement community under 24 CFR part 570, subpart D, and is not expected to be a participating jurisdiction in the HOME program under 24 CFR part 92, as well as an Insular Area that is a HOME or CDBG grantee, may submit an abbreviated consolidated plan that is appropriate to the types and amounts of assistance sought from HUD, instead of a full consolidated plan.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">When is an abbreviated plan necessary?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Jurisdiction.</E> When a jurisdiction that is permitted to use an abbreviated plan applies to HUD for funds under a program that requires an approved consolidated plan (see § 91.2(b)), it must obtain approval of an abbreviated plan (or full consolidated plan) and submit a certification that the housing activities are consistent with the plan.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Other applicants.</E> When an eligible applicant other than a jurisdiction (e.g., a public housing agency or nonprofit organization) seeks to apply for funding under a program requiring certification of consistency with an approved consolidated plan, the jurisdiction—if it is permitted to use an abbreviated plan—may prepare an abbreviated plan appropriate to the project. See § 91.510.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> For the HOME program, an abbreviated consolidated plan is permitted only with respect to reallocations to other than participating jurisdictions (see 24 CFR part 92, subpart J), and for Insular Area grantees that submit an abbreviated consolidated plan pursuant to 24 CFR 570.440. For the CDBG program, an abbreviated plan may be submitted for the HUD-administered Small Cities program (except that an abbreviated plan may not be submitted for the HUD-administered Small Cities program in the state of Hawaii), and for Insular Area grantees pursuant to 24 CFR 570.440.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">What is an abbreviated plan?</E>—(1) <E T="03">Assessment of needs, resources, and planned activities.</E> An abbreviated plan must contain sufficient information about needs, resources, and planned activities to address the needs to cover the type and amount of assistance anticipated to be funded by HUD. The plan must describe how the jurisdiction will affirmatively further fair housing by addressing issues identified in an AFH conducted in accordance with 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180.<PRTPAGE P="516"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Nonhousing community development plan.</E> If the jurisdiction seeks assistance under the Community Development Block Grant program, it must describe the jurisdiction's priority non-housing community development needs eligible for assistance under HUD's community development programs by CDBG eligibility category, reflecting the needs of families for each type of activity, as appropriate, in terms of dollar amounts estimated to meet the priority need for the type of activity, in accordance with a table prescribed by HUD. This community development component of the plan must state the jurisdiction's specific long-term and short-term community development objectives (including economic development activities that create jobs), which must be developed in accordance with the statutory goals described in § 91.1 and the primary objective of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5301(c), of the development of viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for low-income and moderate-income persons.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Separate application for funding.</E> In addition to submission of the abbreviated consolidated plan, an application must be submitted for funding is sought under a competitive program. The applicable program requirements are found in the regulations for the program and in the Notice of Funding Availability published for the applicable fiscal year. For the CDBG Small Cities program, the applicable regulations are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart F.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Submissions, certifications, amendments, and performance reports.</E> An Insular Area grantee that submits an abbreviated consolidated plan under this section must comply with the submission, certification, amendment, and performance report requirements of 24 CFR 570.440. This includes certification that the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing, which means that it will take meaningful actions to further the goals identified in an AFH conducted in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, and that it will take no action that is materially inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">What consultation is applicable?</E> The jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to consult with appropriate public and private social service agencies regarding the needs to be served with the funding sought from HUD. The jurisdiction must attempt some consultation with the State. (Section 91.100 does not apply.)</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Citizen Participation.</E> An Insular Area grantee that submits an abbreviated consolidated plan under this section must comply with the citizen participation requirements of 24 CFR 570.441.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the state's estimated housing needs projected for the ensuing five-year period. Housing data included in this portion of the plan shall be based on U.S. Census data, as provided by HUD, as updated by any properly conducted local study, or any other reliable source that the state clearly identifies and should reflect the consultation with social service agencies and other entities conducted in accordance with § 91.110 and the citizen participation process conducted in accordance with § 91.115. For a state seeking funding under the HOPWA program, the needs described for housing and supportive services must address the unmet needs of low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families in areas outside of eligible metropolitan statistical areas.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Categories of persons affected.</E> (1)(i) The plan shall estimate the number and type of families in need of housing assistance for:</P>

            <P>(J) Persons with disabilities; and</P>
            <P>(K) Formerly homeless families and individuals who are receiving rapid re-housing assistance and are nearing the termination of that assistance.</P>

(The state must define in its consolidated plan the terms “standard condition” and “substandard condition but suitable for rehabilitation.”)</P>

            <P>(2) Until the jurisdiction has submitted an AFH, which includes an assessment of disproportionate housing needs in accordance with 24 CFR 5.154(d)(2)(iv), the following assessment shall continue to be included in the <PRTPAGE P="518"/>consolidated plan. For any of the income categories enumerated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to the extent that any racial or ethnic group has disproportionately greater need in comparison to the needs of that category as a whole, assessment of that specific need shall be included. For this purpose, disproportionately greater need exists when the percentage of persons in a category of need who are members of a particular racial or ethnic group in a category of need is at least 10 percentage points higher than the percentage of persons in the category as a whole. Once the jurisdiction has submitted an AFH, however, this assessment need not be included in the consolidated plan.</P>

            <P>(i) The description must include, for each category of homeless persons specified by HUD (including chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth), the number of persons experiencing homelessness on a given night, the number of persons who experience homelessness each year, the number of persons who lose their housing and become homeless each year, the number of persons who exit homelessness each year, and the number of days that persons experience homelessness, and any other measures specified by HUD.</P>
            <P>(ii) The plan also must contain a brief narrative description of the nature and extent of homelessness by racial and ethnic group, to the extent that information is available.</P>
            <P>(2) The plan must include a narrative description of the characteristics and needs of low-income individuals and families with children (especially extremely low-income) who are currently housed but threatened with homelessness. This information may be evidenced by the characteristics and needs of individuals and families with children who are currently entering the homeless assistance system or appearing for the first time on the streets. The description must also include specific housing characteristics linked to instability and an increased risk of homelessness.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Other special needs.</E> (1) The State shall estimate, to the extent practicable, the number of persons who are not homeless but require supportive housing, including the elderly, frail elderly, persons with disabilities (mental, physical, developmental), persons with alcohol or other drug addiction, persons with HIV/AIDS and their families, and any other categories the State may specify, and describe their supportive housing needs.</P>

            <P>(4) Summarize the priorities and specific objectives the state intends to initiate and/or complete during the time period covered by the strategic plan describing how the proposed distribution of funds will address identified needs. For each specific objective statement, identify proposed accomplishments and outcomes the state hopes to achieve in quantitative terms over a specified time period (e.g., one, two, three or more years), or in other measurable terms as identified and defined by the state. This information shall be provided in accordance with guidance to be issued by HUD.</P>
            <P>(5)(i) Describe how the priorities and specific objectives of the State under § 91.315(a)(4) will affirmatively further fair housing by setting forth strategies and actions consistent with the goals and other elements identified in an AFH conducted in accordance with 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180.</P>
            <P>(ii) For AFH goals not addressed by these priorities and objectives, identify any additional objectives and priorities for affirmatively furthering fair housing.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Affordable housing.</E> With respect to affordable housing, the consolidated plan must include the priority housing needs table prescribed by HUD and the following:</P>

            <P>(1) The affordable housing section shall describe how the characteristics of the housing market and the severity of housing problems and needs of extremely low-income, low-income, and moderate-income renters and owners, persons at risk of homelessness, and homeless persons identified in accordance with § 91.305 provided the rationale for establishing allocation priorities and use of funds made available <PRTPAGE P="520"/>for rental assistance, production of new units, rehabilitation of existing units, or acquisition of existing units (including preserving affordable housing units that may be lost from the assisted housing inventory for any reason). Household and income types may be grouped together for discussion where the analysis would apply to more than one of them.

A state is not required to describe the manner in which financial or other assistance is provided if the troubled public housing agency is located entirely within the boundaries of a unit of general local government that must submit a consolidated plan to HUD.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Homelessness.</E> The consolidated plan must include the priority homeless needs table prescribed by HUD and must describe the State's strategy for reducing and ending homelessness through:</P>
            <P>(1) Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs;</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Other special needs.</E> With respect to supportive needs of the non-homeless, the consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the priority housing and supportive service needs of persons who are not homeless but require supportive housing, i.e., elderly, frail elderly, persons with disabilities (mental, physical, developmental), persons with alcohol or other drug addiction, persons with HIV/AIDS and their families, and public housing residents. If the state intends to use HOME funds for tenant-based assistance to assist one or more of these subpopulations, it <PRTPAGE P="521"/>must specify local market conditions that led to the choice of this option.</P>

            <P>(g) <E T="03">Community Revitalization.</E> States are encouraged to identify areas where geographically targeted revitalization efforts are carried out through multiple activities in a concentrated and coordinated manner. In addition, a state may elect to allow units of general local government to carry out a community revitalization strategy that includes the economic empowerment of low-income residents, in order to obtain the additional flexibility available as provided in 24 CFR part 570, subpart I. A state must approve a local government's revitalization strategy before it may be implemented. If a state elects to allow revitalization strategies in its program, the method of distribution contained in a state's action plan pursuant to § 91.320(k)(1) must reflect the state's process and criteria for approving local government's revitalization strategies. The strategy must identify the long-term and short-term objectives (e.g., physical improvements, social initiatives, and economic empowerment), expressing them in terms of measures of outputs and outcomes that are expected through the use of HUD programs.

            <P>(j) <E T="03">Anti-poverty strategy.</E> The consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the state's goals, programs, and policies for reducing the number of poverty-level families and how the state's goals, programs, and policies for producing and preserving affordable housing, set forth in the housing component of the consolidated plan, will be coordinated with other programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families as well as employment and training programs and services for which the state is responsible and the extent to which they will reduce (or assist in reducing) the number of poverty-level families, taking into consideration factors over which the state has control.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Institutional structure.</E> The consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the institutional structure, including businesses, developers, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, community-based and faith-based organizations, the Continuum of Care, and public institutions, departments, and agencies through which the State will carry out its housing, homeless, and community development plan; a brief assessment of the strengths and gaps in that delivery system; and a concise summary of what the State will do to overcome gaps in the institutional structure for carrying out its strategy for addressing its priority needs.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The consolidated plan must provide a concise summary of the jurisdiction's activities to enhance coordination among Continuums of Care, public and assisted housing providers, and private and governmental health, mental health, and service agencies. The summary must <PRTPAGE P="522"/>include the jurisdiction's efforts to coordinate housing assistance and services for homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) and persons who were recently homeless but now live in permanent housing. With respect to the public entities involved, the plan must describe the means of cooperation and coordination among the State and any units of general local government in the implementation of its consolidated plan. With respect to economic development, the State should describe efforts to enhance coordination with private industry, businesses, developers, and social service agencies.</P>

If the State is selecting applications submitted by eligible recipients, the plan must include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) The plan must provide priority for funding based on geographic diversity (as defined by the State in the consolidated plan); the applicant's ability to obligate HTF funds and undertake eligible activities in a timely manner; in the case of rental housing projects, the extent to which the project has Federal, State, or local project-based rental assistance so that rents are affordable to extremely low-income families; in the case of rental housing projects, the duration of the units' affordability period; the merits of the application in meeting the priority housing needs of the State (such as housing that is accessible to transit or employment centers, housing that includes green building and sustainable development features, or housing that serves special needs populations); and the extent to which the application makes use of non-federal funding sources.</P>
            <P>(ii) The plan must include the requirement that the application contain a description of the eligible activities to be conducted with the HTF funds (as provided in 24 CFR 93.200) and contain a certification by each eligible recipient that housing units assisted with the HTF will comply with HTF requirements. The plan must also describe eligibility requirements for recipients (as defined in 24 CFR 93.2).</P>
            <P>(iii) The plan must provide for performance goals and benchmarks against which the State will measure its progress, consistent with the State's goals established under 24 CFR 91.315(b)(2).</P>

            <P>(v) If the State intends to use HTF funds for first-time homebuyers, it must set forth the guidelines for resale or recapture, and obtain HUD's specific, written approval, as required in § 93.304(f). Approval of the consolidated plan or action plan under § 91.500 or the failure to disapprove the consolidated plan or action does not satisfy the requirement for specific HUD approval for resale or recapture guidelines.</P>

            <P>(vi) If the State intends to use HTF funds for homebuyer assistance and does not use the HTF affordable homeownership limits for the area provided by HUD, it must determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price and set forth the information in accordance with § 93.305.<PRTPAGE P="527"/>
            </P>
            <P>(vii) The State may limit the beneficiaries or give preferences to a particular segment of the extremely low- or very low-income population only if described in the action plan.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard of review.</E> HUD may disapprove a plan or a portion of a plan if it is inconsistent with the purposes of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12703), if it is substantially incomplete, or, in the case of certifications applicable to the CDBG program under §§ 91.225 (a) and (b) or 91.325 (a) and (b), if it is not satisfactory to the Secretary in accordance with §§ 570.304, 570.429(g), or 570.485(c) of this title, as applicable. The following are examples of consolidated plans that are substantially incomplete:</P>
            <P>(1) A plan that was developed without the required citizen participation or the required consultation;</P>
            <P>(2) A plan that fails to satisfy all the required elements in this part; and</P>
            <P>(3) A plan for which a certification is rejected by HUD as inaccurate, after HUD has inspected the evidence and provided due notice and opportunity to the jurisdiction for comment; and</P>

            <P>(4) A plan that does not include a description of the manner in which the unit of general local government or state will provide financial or other assistance to a public housing agency if the public housing agency is designated as “troubled” by HUD.<PRTPAGE P="533"/>
            </P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Written notice of disapproval.</E> Within 15 days after HUD notifies a jurisdiction that it is disapproving its plan, it must inform the jurisdiction in writing of the reasons for disapproval and actions that the jurisdiction could take to meet the criteria for approval. Disapproval of a plan with respect to one program does not affect assistance distributed on the basis of a formula under other programs.</P>

            <P>(1) To make a change in its allocation priorities or a change in the method of distribution of funds;</P>
            <P>(2) To carry out an activity, using funds from any program covered by the consolidated plan (including program income, reimbursements, repayment, recaptures, or reallocations from HUD), not previously described in the action plan; or</P>
            <P>(3) To change the purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries of an activity.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Criteria for substantial amendment.</E> The jurisdiction shall identify in its citizen participation plan the criteria it will use for determining what constitutes a substantial amendment. It is these substantial amendments that are subject to a citizen participation process, in accordance with the jurisdiction's citizen participation plan. (See §§ 91.105 and 91.115.)</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Submission to HUD.</E> (1) Upon completion, the jurisdiction must make the amendment public and must notify HUD that an amendment has been made. The jurisdiction may submit a copy of each amendment to HUD as it occurs, or at the end of the program year. Letters transmitting copies of amendments must be signed by the official representative of the jurisdiction authorized to take such action.</P>
            <P>(2) See subpart B of this part for the public notice procedures applicable to substantial amendments. For any amendment affecting the HOPWA program that would involve acquisition, rehabilitation, conversion, lease, repair or construction of properties to provide housing, an environmental review of the revised proposed use of funds must be completed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 574.510.</P>
            <P>(d) The jurisdiction must ensure that amendments to the plan are consistent with its certification to affirmatively further fair housing and the analysis and strategies of the AFH.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> For competitive programs, a certification of consistency of the application with the approved consolidated plan for the jurisdiction may be required, whether the applicant is the jurisdiction or another applicant.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Certifying authority.</E> (1) The certification must be obtained from the unit of general local government if the project will be located in a unit of general local government that: is required to have a consolidated plan, is authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan but elects to prepare and has submitted a full consolidated plan, or is authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan and is applying for the same program as the applicant pursuant to the same Notice of Funding Availability (and therefore has or will have an abbreviated consolidated plan for the fiscal year for that program).</P>

            <P>(2) If the project will not be located in a unit of general local government, the certification may be obtained from the State or, if the project will be located in a unit of general local government authorized to use an abbreviated consolidated plan, from the unit of general local government if it is willing to prepare such a plan.<PRTPAGE P="534"/>
            </P>
            <P>(3) Where the recipient of a HOPWA grant is a city that is the most populous unit of general local government in an EMSA, it also must obtain and keep on file certifications of consistency from such public officials for each other locality in the EMSA in which housing assistance is provided.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Meaning.</E> A jurisdiction's certification that an application is consistent with its consolidated plan means the jurisdiction's plan shows need, the proposed activities are consistent with the jurisdiction's strategic plan, and the location of the proposed activities is consistent with the geographic areas specified in the plan. The jurisdiction shall provide the reasons for the denial when it fails to provide a certification of consistency.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Overview.</SUBJECT>

            <P>This part implements the HOME Investment Partnerships Act (the HOME Investment Partnerships Program). In general, under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, HUD allocates funds by formula among eligible State and local governments to strengthen public-private partnerships and to expand the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, with primary attention to rental housing, for very low-income and low-income families. Generally, HOME funds must be matched by nonfederal resources. State and local governments that become participating jurisdictions may use HOME funds to carry out multi-year housing strategies through acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of <PRTPAGE P="538"/>housing, and tenant-based rental assistance. Participating jurisdictions may provide assistance in a number of eligible forms, including loans, advances, equity investments, interest subsidies and other forms of investment that HUD approves.</P>

            <P>(1) The participating jurisdiction has executed a legally binding written agreement (that includes the date of the signature of each person signing the agreement) that meets the minimum requirements for a written agreement in § 92.504(c). An agreement between the participating jurisdiction and a subrecipient that is controlled by the participating jurisdiction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an agency whose officials or employees are official or employees of the participating jurisdiction) does not constitute a commitment. An agreement between the representative unit and a member unit of general local government of a consortium does not constitute a commitment. Funds for administrative and planning costs of the HOME program are committed based on the amount in the program disbursement and information system for administration and planning. The written agreement must be:</P>
            <P>(i) With a State recipient or a subrecipient to use a specific amount of HOME funds to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance;</P>
            <P>(ii) With a community housing development organization to provide operating expenses;</P>
            <P>(iii) With a community housing development organization to provide project-specific technical assistance and site control loans or project-specific seed money loans, in accordance with § 92.301;</P>
            <P>(iv) To develop the capacity of community housing development organizations in the jurisdiction, in accordance with § 92.300(b); or</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Commit to a specific local project</E> means:</P>
            <P>(i) If the project consists of rehabilitation or new construction (with or without acquisition) the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or sub recipient) and project owner have executed a written legally binding agreement under which HOME assistance will be provided to the owner for an identifiable project for which all necessary financing has been secured, a budget and schedule have been established, and underwriting has been completed and under which construction is scheduled to start within twelve months of the agreement date. If the project is owned by the participating jurisdiction or State recipient, the project has been set up in the disbursement and information system established by HUD, and construction can reasonably be expected to start within twelve months of the project set-up date.</P>

            <P>(ii)(A) If the project consists of acquisition of standard housing and the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) is acquiring the property with HOME funds, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) and the property owner have executed a legally binding contract for sale of an identifiable property and the property title will be transferred to the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) within six months of the date of the contract.<PRTPAGE P="539"/>
            </P>
            <P>(B) If the project consists of acquisition of standard housing and the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) is providing HOME funds to a family to acquire single family housing for homeownership or to a purchaser to acquire rental housing, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient or subrecipient) and the family or purchaser have executed a written agreement under which HOME assistance will be provided for the purchase of the single family housing or rental housing and the property title will be transferred to the family or purchaser within six months of the agreement date.</P>
            <P>(iii) If the project consists of tenant-based rental assistance, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient, or subrecipient) has entered into a rental assistance contract with the owner or the tenant in accordance with the provisions of § 92.209.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Community housing development organization</E> means a private nonprofit organization that:</P>
            <P>(1) Is organized under State or local laws;</P>
            <P>(2) Has no part of its net earnings inuring to the benefit of any member, founder, contributor, or individual;</P>
            <P>(3) Is neither controlled by, nor under the direction of, individuals or entities seeking to derive profit or gain from the organization. A community housing development organization may be sponsored or created by a for-profit entity, but:</P>
            <P>(i) The for-profit entity may not be an entity whose primary purpose is the development or management of housing, such as a builder, developer, or real estate management firm.</P>
            <P>(ii) The for-profit entity may not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's governing body. Board members appointed by the for-profit entity may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the board members;</P>
            <P>(iii) The community housing development organization must be free to contract for goods and services from vendors of its own choosing; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The officers and employees of the for-profit entity may not be officers or employees of the community housing development organization.</P>
            <P>(4) Has a tax exemption ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 CFR 1.501(c)(3)-1 or 1.501(c)(4)-1)), is classified as a subordinate of a central organization non-profit under section 905 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or if the private nonprofit organization is an wholly owned entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for tax purposes (e.g., a single member limited liability company that is wholly owned by an organization that qualifies as tax-exempt), the owner organization has a tax exemption ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and meets the definition of “community housing development organization;”</P>
            <P>(5) Is not a governmental entity (including the participating jurisdiction, other jurisdiction, Indian tribe, public housing authority, Indian housing authority, housing finance agency, or redevelopment authority) and is not controlled by a governmental entity. An organization that is created by a governmental entity may qualify as a community housing development organization; however, the governmental entity may not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's governing body and no more than one- third of the board members may be public officials or employees of governmental entity. Board members appointed by a governmental entity may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the board members. The officers or employees of a governmental entity may not be officers or employees of a community housing development organization;</P>
            <P>(6) Has standards of financial accountability that conform to 2 CFR 200.302, ‘Financial Management’ and 2 CFR 200.303, ‘Internal Controls;’</P>
            <P>(7) Has among its purposes the provision of decent housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income persons, as evidenced in its charter, articles of incorporation, resolutions or by-laws;</P>
            <P>(8) Maintains accountability to low-income community residents by:</P>

            <P>(i) Maintaining at least one-third of its governing board's membership for <PRTPAGE P="540"/>residents of low-income neighborhoods, other low-income community residents, or elected representative of low-income neighborhood organizations. For urban areas, “community” may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, city, county or metropolitan area; for rural areas, it may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, town, village, county, or multi-county area (but not the entire State); and</P>
            <P>(ii) Providing a formal process for low-income program beneficiaries to advise the organization in its decisions regarding the design, siting, development, and management of affordable housing;</P>
            <P>(9) Has a demonstrated capacity for carrying out housing projects assisted with HOME funds. A designated organization undertaking development activities as a developer or sponsor must satisfy this requirement by having paid employees with housing development experience who will work on projects assisted with HOME funds. For its first year of funding as a community housing development organization, an organization may satisfy this requirement through a contract with a consultant who has housing development experience to train appropriate key staff of the organization. An organization that will own housing must demonstrate capacity to act as owner of a project and meet the requirements of § 92.300(a)(2). A nonprofit organization does not meet the test of demonstrated capacity based on any person who is a volunteer or whose services are donated by another organization; and</P>
            <P>(10) Has a history of serving the community within which housing to be assisted with HOME funds is to be located. In general, an organization must be able to show one year of serving the community before HOME funds are reserved for the organization.

              <E T="03">Homeownership</E> means ownership in fee simple title in a 1- to 4-unit dwelling or in a condominium unit, or equivalent form of ownership approved by HUD.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Formula allocation.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Jurisdictions eligible for a formula allocation.</E> HUD will provide allocations of funds in amounts determined by the formula described in this section to units of general local governments that, as of the end of the previous fiscal year, are metropolitan cities, urban counties, or consortia approved under § 92.101; and States.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Amounts available for allocation; State and local share.</E> The amount of funds that are available for allocation by the formula under this section is equal to the balance of funds remaining after reserving amounts for insular areas, housing education and organizational support, other support for State and local housing strategies, and other purposes authorized by Congress, in accordance with the Act and appropriations.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Formula factors.</E> The formula for determining allocations uses the following factors. The first and sixth factors are weighted 0.1; the other four factors are weighted 0.2.</P>

            <P>(1) Vacancy-adjusted rental units where the household head is at or below the poverty level. These rental units are multiplied by the ratio of the national rental vacancy rate over a jurisdiction's rental vacancy rate.<PRTPAGE P="545"/>
            </P>

            <P>(2) Occupied rental units with at least one of four problems (overcrowding, incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing, or high rent costs). <E T="03">Overcrowding</E> is a condition that exists if there is more than one person per room occupying the unit. <E T="03">Incomplete kitchen facilities</E> means the unit lacks a sink with running water, a range, or a refrigerator. <E T="03">Incomplete plumbing</E> means the unit lacks hot and cold piped water, a flush toilet, or a bathtub or shower inside the unit for the exclusive use of the occupants of the unit. <E T="03">High rent costs</E> occur when more than 30 percent of household income is used for rent.</P>
            <P>(3) Rental units built before 1950 occupied by poor households.</P>
            <P>(4) Rental units described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section multiplied by the ratio of the cost of producing housing for a jurisdiction divided by the national cost.</P>
            <P>(5) Number of families at or below the poverty level.</P>
            <P>(6) Population of a jurisdiction multiplied by a net per capita income (pci). To compute net pci for a jurisdiction or for the nation, the pci of a three person family at the poverty threshold is subtracted from the pci of the jurisdiction or of the nation. The index is constructed by dividing the national net pci by the net pci of a jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Calculating formula allocations for units of general local government.</E> (1) Initial allocation amounts for units of general local government described in paragraph (a) of this section are determined by multiplying the sum of the shares of the six factors in paragraph (c) of this section by 60 percent of the amount available under paragraph (b) of this section for formula allocation. The shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for each jurisdiction over the corresponding factor for the total for all of these units of general local government.</P>
            <P>(2) If any of the initial amounts for such units of general local government in Puerto Rico exceeds twice the national average, on a per rental unit basis, that amount is capped at twice the national average.</P>
            <P>(3) To determine the maximum number of units of general local government that receive a formula allocation, only one jurisdiction (the unit of general local government with the smallest allocation of HOME funds) is dropped from the pool of eligible jurisdictions on each successive recalculation, except that jurisdictions that are participating jurisdictions (other than consortia that fail to renew the membership of all of their member jurisdictions) are not dropped. Then the amount of funds available for units of general local government is redistributed to all others. This recalculation/redistribution continues until all remaining units of general local government receive an allocation of $500,000 or more or are participating jurisdictions. Only units of general local government which receive an allocation of $500,000 or more under the formula or which are participating jurisdictions will be awarded an allocation. In fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than $1.5 billion of HOME funds, $335,000 is substituted for $500,000.</P>

            <P>(4) The allocation amounts determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section are reduced by any amounts that are necessary to provide increased allocations to States that have no unit of general local government receiving a formula allocation (see paragraph (e)(4) of this section). These reductions are made on a <E T="03">pro rata</E> basis, except that no unit of general local government allocation is reduced below $500,000 (or $335,000 in fiscal years in which Congress appropriates less than $1.5 billion of HOME funds) and no participating jurisdiction allocation which is below this amount is reduced.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculating formula allocations for States.</E> (1) Forty percent of the funds available for allocation under paragraph (b) of this section are allocated to States. The allocation amounts for States are calculated by determining initial amounts for each State, based on the sum of the shares of the six factors. For 20 percent of the funds to be allocated to States, the shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for the entire State over the corresponding factor for the total for all States. For 80 percent of the funds to be allocated to States, the shares are the ratio of the weighted factor for all units of general local government within the State that do not receive a formula allocation <PRTPAGE P="546"/>over the corresponding factor for the total for all States.</P>
            <P>(2) If the initial amounts for Puerto Rico (based on either or both the 80 percent of funds or 20 percent of funds calculation) exceed twice the national average, on a per rental unit basis, each amount that exceeds the national average is capped at twice the national average, and the resultant funds are reallocated to other States on a prorata basis.</P>
            <P>(3) If the initial amounts when combined for any State are less than the $3,000,000, the allocation to that State is increased to the $3,000,000 and all other State allocations are reduced by an equal amount on a prorata basis, except that no State allocation is reduced below $3,000,000.</P>
            <P>(4) The allocation amount for each State that has no unit of general local government within the State receiving an allocation under paragraph (d) of this section is increased by $500,000. Funds for this increase are derived from the funds available for units of general local government, in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</P>

If HUD determines from this review that the insular area does not have the capacity to administer effectively a new allocation, or a portion of a new allocation, in addition to allocations currently under administration, HUD may reduce the insular area's initial allocation amount.</P>

              <P>(1) Subpart E (Program Requirements): Administrative costs, as described in § 92.207, are eligible costs for insular areas in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the HOME funds provided to the insular area. The matching contribution requirements in this part do not apply.</P>
              <P>(2) Subpart K (Program Administration):</P>
              <P>(i) Section 92.500 (The HOME Investment Trust Fund) does not apply. HUD will establish a HOME account in the United States Treasury for each insular area and the HOME funds must be used for approved activities. A local account must be established for program income. Each insular area may use either a separate local HOME account or a subsidiary account within its general fund (or other appropriate fund) as the local HOME account. HUD will recapture HOME funds in the HOME Treasury account by the amount of:</P>
              <P>(A) Any funds that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the insular area of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement;</P>

              <P>(ii) Section 92.502 (Program disbursement and information system) applies, except that references to the HOME Investment Trust Fund mean HOME account. In addition, § 92.502(c) does not apply, and instead compliance with Treasury Circular No. 1075 (31 CFR part 205) and 2 CFR 200.305 is required.</P>
              <P>(iii) Section 92.503 (Program income, repayments, and recaptured funds) applies, except that the funds may be retained provided the funds are used for eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 92.504 (Participating jurisdiction responsibilities; written agreements; on-site inspections) applies, except that the written agreement must ensure compliance with the requirements in this section.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(5) Section 92.509 (Performance reports) applies, except that a performance report is required for the fiscal year allocation only after completion of the approved projects funded by the allocation.</P>
              <P>(6) Subpart L (Performance Reviews and Sanctions): Section 92.552 does not apply. Instead, § 92.65 applies.</P>
              <P>(b) The requirements of subpart H (Other Federal Requirements) of this part apply as follows: § 92.357 Executive Order 12372 applies as written, and the requirements of the remaining sections which apply to participating jurisdictions are applicable to the insular areas.</P>
              <P>(c) Subpart B (Allocation Formula), subpart C (Consortia; Designation and Revocation as a Participating Jurisdiction), subpart D (Submission Requirements), and subpart G (Community Housing Development Organizations) of this part do not apply.</P>

            <P>(a) A consortium of geographically contiguous units of general local government is a unit of general local government for purposes of this part if the requirements of this section are met.</P>
            <P>(1) One or more members of a proposed consortium or an existing consortium whose consortium qualification terminates at the end of the fiscal year, must provide written notification to the HUD Field Office of its intent to participate as a consortium in the HOME Program for the following fiscal year. HUD shall establish the deadline for this submission.</P>
            <P>(2) The proposed consortium must provide, at such time and in a manner and form prescribed by HUD, the qualification documents, which will include submission of:</P>
            <P>(i) A written certification by the State that the consortium will direct its activities to alleviation of housing problems within the State; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Documentation which demonstrates that the consortium has executed one legally binding cooperation agreement among its members authorizing one member unit of general local government to act in a representative capacity for all member units of general local government for the purposes of this part and providing that the representative member assumes overall responsibility for ensuring that the consortium's HOME Program is carried out in compliance with the requirements of this part.</P>

            <P>(3) Before the end of the fiscal year in which the notice of intent and documentation are submitted, HUD must determine that a proposed consortium has sufficient authority and administrative capability to carry out the purposes of this part on behalf of its member jurisdictions. HUD will endeavor to make its determination as quickly as practicable after receiving the consortium's documentation in order to provide the consortium an opportunity to correct its submission, if necessary. If <PRTPAGE P="550"/>the submission is deficient, HUD will work with the consortium to resolve the issue, but will not delay the formula allocations. HUD, at its discretion, may review the performance of an existing consortium that wishes to requalify to determine whether it continues to have sufficient authority and administrative capacity to successfully administer the program.</P>
            <P>(b) A metropolitan city or an urban county may be a member of a consortium. A unit of general local government that is included in an urban county may be part of a consortium, only if the urban county joins the consortium. The included local government cannot join the consortium except through participation in the urban county.</P>
            <P>(c) A non-urban county may be a member of a consortium. However, the county cannot on its own include the whole county in the consortium. A unit of local government located within the non-urban county that wishes to participate as a member of the consortium must sign the HOME consortium agreement.</P>
            <P>(d) If the representative unit of general local government distributes HOME funds to member units of general local government, the representative unit is responsible for applying to the member units of general local government the same requirements as are applicable to subrecipients.</P>
            <P>(e) The consortium's qualification as a unit of general local government continues for a period of three successive Federal fiscal years, or until HUD revokes its designation as a participating jurisdiction, or until an urban county member fails to requalify under the CDBG program as an urban county for a fiscal year included in the consortium's qualification period, or the consortium fails to receive a HOME allocation for the first Federal fiscal year of the consortium's qualification period and does not request to be considered to receive a HOME allocation in each of the subsequent two years. However, if a member urban county's three year CDBG qualification cycle is not the same as the consortium, the consortium may elect a shorter qualification period than three years to synchronize with the urban county's qualification period. During the period of qualification, additional units of general local government may join the consortium, but no included unit of general local government may withdraw from the consortium. See 24 CFR part 91, subpart E, for consolidated plan requirements for consortia, including the requirement that all members of the consortia must be on the same program year.</P>
            <P>(f) The consortium agreement may, at the option of its member units of general local government, contain a provision that authorizes automatic renewals for the successive qualification period of three Federal fiscal years. The provision authorizing automatic renewal must require the lead consortium member to give the consortium members written notice of their right to elect not to continue participation for the new qualification period.</P>

            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction may only invest its HOME funds in eligible projects within its boundaries, or in jointly funded projects within the boundaries of contiguous local jurisdictions which serve residents from both jurisdictions. For a project to be jointly funded, both jurisdictions must make a financial contribution to the project. A jurisdiction's financial contribution may take the form of a grant or loan (including a loan of funds that comes from other federal sources and that are in the jurisdiction's control, such as CDBG program funds) or relief of a significant tax or fee (such as waiver of impact fees, property taxes, or other taxes or fees customarily imposed on projects within the jurisdiction).</P>

The State must distribute HOME funds to rural areas in amounts that take into account the non-metropolitan share of the State's total population and objective measures of rural housing need, such as poverty and substandard housing, as set forth in the State's approved consolidated plan. To the extent the need is within the boundaries of a participating unit of general local government, the State and the unit of general local government shall coordinate activities to address that need.</P>

A unit of general local government designated by a State to receive HOME funds from a State is a State recipient.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) A State that uses State recipients to perform program functions shall ensure that the State recipients use HOME funds in accordance with the requirements of this part and other applicable laws. The State may require the State recipient to comply with requirements established by the State or may permit the State recipient to establish its own requirements to comply with this part.</P>
            <P>(ii) The State shall conduct such reviews and audit of its State recipients as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether the State recipient has committed and expended the HOME funds in the United States Treasury account as required by § 92.500, and has met the requirements of this part, particularly eligible activities, income targeting, affordability, and matching contribution requirements.</P>
            <P>(4) A State and local participating jurisdiction may jointly fund a project within the boundaries of the local participating jurisdiction. The State may provide the HOME funds to the project or it may provide the HOME funds to the local participating jurisdiction to fund the project.</P>
            <P>(5) A State may fund projects on Indian reservations located within the State provided that the State includes Indian reservations in its consolidated plan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Income determinations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The HOME program has income targeting requirements for the HOME program and for HOME projects. Therefore, the participating jurisdiction must determine each family is income eligible by determining the family's annual income.</P>
            <P>(1) For families who are tenants in HOME-assisted housing and not receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance, the participating jurisdiction must initially determine annual income using the method in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. For subsequent income determinations during the period of affordability, the participating jurisdiction may use any one of the following methods in accordance with § 92.252(h):</P>
            <P>(i) Examine at least 2 months of source documents evidencing annual income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family.</P>
            <P>(ii) Obtain from the family a written statement of the amount of the family's annual income and family size, along with a certification that the information is complete and accurate. The certification must state that the family will provide source documents upon request.</P>
            <P>(iii) Obtain a written statement from the administrator of a government program under which the family receives benefits and which examines each year the annual income of the family. The statement must indicate the tenant's family size and state the amount of the family's annual income; or alternatively, the statement must indicate the current dollar limit for very low- or low-income families for the family size of the tenant and state that the tenant's annual income does not exceed this limit.</P>
            <P>(2) For all other families (i.e., homeowners receiving rehabilitation assistance, homebuyers, and recipients of HOME tenant-based rental assistance), the participating jurisdiction must determine annual income by examining at least 2 months of source documents evidencing annual income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement, unemployment compensation statement) for the family.</P>
            <P>(b) When determining whether a family is income eligible, the participating jurisdiction must use one of the following two definitions of “annual income”:</P>
            <P>(1) Annual income as defined at 24 CFR 5.609 (except when determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied rehabilitation project, the value of the homeowner's principal residence may be excluded from the calculation of Net Family Assets, as defined in 24 CFR 5.603); or</P>
            <P>(2) Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual income tax purposes.</P>
            <P>(c) Although the participating jurisdiction may use either of the definitions of “annual income” permitted in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate adjusted income, it must apply exclusions from income established at 24 CFR 5.611. The HOME rents for very low-income families established under § 92.252(b)(2) are based on adjusted income. In addition, the participating jurisdiction may base the amount of tenant-based rental assistance on the adjusted income of the family. The participating jurisdiction may use only one definition for each HOME-assisted program (e.g., downpayment assistance program) that it administers and for each rental housing project.</P>

            <P>(d)(1) The participating jurisdiction must calculate the annual income of the family by projecting the prevailing rate of income of the family at the <PRTPAGE P="554"/>time the participating jurisdiction determines that the family is income eligible. Annual income shall include income from all persons in the household. Income or asset enhancement derived from the HOME-assisted project shall not be considered in calculating annual income.</P>
            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction is not required to re-examine the family's income at the time the HOME assistance is provided, unless more than six months has elapsed since the participating jurisdiction determined that the family qualified as income eligible.</P>
            <P>(3) The participating jurisdiction must follow the requirements in § 5.617 when making subsequent income determinations of persons with disabilities who are tenants in HOME-assisted rental housing or who receive tenant-based rental assistance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible activities.</E> (1) HOME funds may be used by a participating jurisdiction to provide incentives to develop and support affordable rental housing and homeownership affordability through the acquisition (including assistance to homebuyers), new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of nonluxury housing with suitable amenities, including real property acquisition, site improvements, conversion, demolition, and other expenses, including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations; to provide tenant-based rental assistance, including security deposits; to provide payment of reasonable administrative and planning costs; and to provide for the payment of operating expenses of community housing development organizations. The housing must be permanent or transitional housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are set forth in §§ 92.206 through 92.209. The activities and costs are eligible only if the housing meets the property standards in § 92.251 upon project completion.</P>
              <P>(2) Acquisition of vacant land or demolition must be undertaken only with respect to a particular housing project intended to provide affordable housing within the time frames established in paragraph (2) of the definition of “commitment” in § 92.2.</P>
              <P>(3) Conversion of an existing structure to affordable housing is rehabilitation, unless the conversion entails adding one or more units beyond the existing walls, in which case, the project is new construction for purposes of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Manufactured housing.</E> HOME funds may be used to purchase and/or rehabilitate a manufactured housing unit, or purchase the land upon which a manufactured housing unit is located. Except for existing, owner-occupied manufactured housing that is rehabilitated with HOME funds, the manufactured housing unit must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Forms of assistance.</E> (1) A participating jurisdiction may invest HOME funds as equity investments, interest-bearing loans or advances, non-interest-bearing loans or advances, interest subsidies consistent with the purposes of this part, deferred payment loans, grants, or other forms of assistance that HUD determines to be consistent with the purposes of this part and specifically approves in writing. Each participating jurisdiction has the right to establish the terms of assistance, subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) A participating jurisdiction may invest HOME funds to guarantee loans made by lenders and, if required, the participating jurisdiction may establish a loan guarantee account with HOME funds. The HOME funds may be used to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest or payment of the outstanding principal and interest upon foreclosure of the loan. The amount of the loan guarantee account must be based on a reasonable estimate of the default rate on the guaranteed loans, but under no circumstances may the amount on deposit exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding principal amount guaranteed; except that the account may include a reasonable minimum balance. While loan funds guaranteed with HOME funds are subject to all HOME requirements, funds which are used to repay the guaranteed loans are not.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Minimum amount of assistance.</E> The minimum amount of HOME funds that must be invested in a project involving rental housing or homeownership is $1,000 times the number of HOME-assisted units in the project.<PRTPAGE P="556"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Multi-unit projects.</E> HOME funds may be used to assist one or more housing units in a multi-unit project.</P>
              <P>(1) Only the actual HOME eligible development costs of the assisted units may be charged to the HOME program. If the assisted and nonassisted units are not comparable, the actual costs may be determined based on a method of cost allocation. If the assisted and non- assisted units are comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms, the actual cost of the HOME- assisted units can be determined by prorating the total HOME eligible development costs of the project so that the proportion of the total development costs charged to the HOME program does not exceed the proportion of the HOME-assisted units in the project.</P>
              <P>(2) After project completion, the number of units designated as HOME- assisted may be reduced only in accordance with § 92.210, except that in a project consisting of all HOME- assisted units, one unit may be subsequently converted to an on-site manager's unit if the participating jurisdiction determines that the conversion will contribute to the stability or effectiveness of the housing and that, notwithstanding the loss of one HOME-assisted unit, the costs charged to the HOME program do not exceed the actual costs of the HOME- assisted units and do not exceed the subsidy limit in § 92.250(b).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Terminated projects.</E> A HOME assisted project that is terminated before completion, either voluntarily or involuntarily, constitutes an ineligible activity, and the participating jurisdiction must repay any HOME funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with § 92.503(b) (except for project- specific assistance to community housing development organizations as provided in § 92.301(a)(3) and (b)(3)).</P>
              <P>(1) A project that does not meet the requirements for affordable housing must be terminated and the participating jurisdiction must repay all HOME funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with § 92.503(b).</P>
              <P>(2) If a participating jurisdiction does not complete a project within 4 years of the date of commitment of funds, the project is considered to be terminated and the participating jurisdiction must repay all funds invested in the project to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund in accordance with § 92.503(b). The participating jurisdiction may request a one-year extension of this deadline in writing, by submitting information about the status of the project, steps being taken to overcome any obstacles to completion, proof of adequate funding to complete the project, and a schedule with milestones for completion of the project for HUD's review and approval.</P>

              <P>(a) Up to 5 percent of a participating jurisdiction's fiscal year HOME allocation may be used for the operating expenses of community housing development organizations (CHDOs). This amount is in addition to amounts set aside for housing projects that are owned, developed, or sponsored by CHDOs as described in § 92.300(a). These funds may not be used to pay operating expenses incurred by a CHDO acting as a subrecipient or contractor under the HOME Program. Operating expenses means reasonable and necessary costs for the operation of the community housing development organization. Such costs include salaries, wages, and other employee compensation and benefits; employee education, training, and travel; rent; utilities; communication costs; taxes; insurance; equipment; materials; and supplies. The requirements and limitations on the receipt of these funds by CHDOs are set forth in § 92.300(e) and (f).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tenant-based rental assistance: Eligible costs and requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible costs.</E> Eligible costs are the rental assistance and security deposit payments made to provide tenant-based rental assistance for a family pursuant to this section. Eligible costs also include utility deposit assistance, but only if this assistance is provided with tenant-based rental assistance or security deposit payment. Administration of tenant-based rental assistance is eligible only under general management oversight and coordination at § 92.207(a), except that the costs of inspecting the housing and determining the income eligibility of the family are eligible as costs of the tenant-based rental assistance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> A participating jurisdiction may use HOME funds for tenant-based rental assistance only if the participating jurisdiction makes the certification about inclusion of this type of assistance in its consolidated plan in accordance with 24 CFR 91.225(d)(1), 91.325(d)(1), or 91.425(a)(2)(i), and specifies local market conditions that lead to the choice of this option.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> The participating jurisdiction must select low-income families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are based on local housing needs and priorities established in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Low-income families.</E> Tenant-based rental assistance may only be provided to very low- and low-income families. The participating jurisdiction must determine that the family is very low- or low-income before the assistance is provided. During the period of assistance, the participating jurisdiction must annually determine that the family continues to be low-income.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Targeted assistance.</E> (i) The participating jurisdiction may establish a preference for individuals with special needs (e.g., homeless persons or elderly persons) or persons with disabilities. The participating jurisdiction may offer, in conjunction with a tenant-based rental assistance program, particular types of nonmandatory services <PRTPAGE P="561"/>that may be most appropriate for persons with a special need or a particular disability. Generally, tenant-based rental assistance and the related services should be made available to all persons with special needs or disabilities who can benefit from such services. Participation may be limited to persons with a specific disability if necessary to provide as effective housing, aid, benefit, or services as those provided to others in accordance with 24 CFR 8.4(b)(1)(iv).</P>
              <P>(ii) The participating jurisdiction may also provide a preference for a specific category of individuals with disabilities (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or chronic mental illness) if the specific category is identified in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan as having unmet need and the preference is needed to narrow the gap in benefits and services received by such persons.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Self-sufficiency program.</E> The participating jurisdiction may require the family to participate in a self- sufficiency program as a condition of selection for assistance. The family's failure to continue participation in the self-sufficiency program is not a basis for terminating the assistance; however, renewal of the assistance may be conditioned on participation in the program. Tenants living in a HOME- assisted rental project who receive tenant-based rental assistance as relocation assistance must not be required to participate in a self- sufficiency program as a condition of receiving assistance.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Homebuyer program.</E> HOME tenant-based rental assistance may assist a tenant who has been identified as a potential low-income homebuyer through a lease-purchase agreement, with monthly rental payments for a period up to 36 months (i.e., 24 months, with a 12-month renewal in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section). The HOME tenant-based rental assistance payment may not be used to accumulate a downpayment or closing costs for the purchase; however, all or a portion of the homebuyer-tenant's monthly contribution toward rent may be set aside for this purpose. If a participating jurisdiction determines that the tenant has met the lease-purchase criteria and is ready to assume ownership, HOME funds may be provided for downpayment assistance in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(v) Preferences cannot be administered in a manner that limits the opportunities of persons on any basis prohibited by the laws listed under 24 CFR 5.105(a). For example, a participating jurisdiction may not determine that persons given a preference under the program are therefore prohibited from applying for or participating in other programs or forms of assistance. Persons who are eligible for a preference must have the opportunity to participate in all programs of the participating jurisdiction, including programs that are not separate or different.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Existing tenants in the HOME-assisted projects.</E> A participating jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in housing units that are designated for rehabilitation or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program. Participating jurisdictions using HOME funds for tenant-based rental assistance programs may establish local preferences for the provision of this assistance. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitated or acquired housing unit or in other qualified housing.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Portability of assistance.</E> A participating jurisdiction may require the family to use the tenant-based assistance within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries or may permit the family to use the assistance outside its boundaries.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Term of rental assistance contract.</E> The term of the rental assistance contract providing assistance with HOME funds may not exceed 24 months, but may be renewed, subject to the availability of HOME funds. The term of the rental assistance contract must begin on the first day of the term of the lease. For a rental assistance contract between a participating jurisdiction and an owner, the term of the contract must terminate on termination of the lease. For a rental assistance contract between a participating jurisdiction and a family, the term of the contract need not end on termination of the lease, but no payments may be made after termination of the lease until a family enters into a new lease.<PRTPAGE P="562"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rent reasonableness.</E> The participating jurisdiction must disapprove a lease if the rent is not reasonable, based on rents that are charged for comparable unassisted rental units.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Tenant protections.</E> The tenant must have a lease that complies with the requirements in § 92.253 (a) and (b).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Maximum subsidy.</E> (1) The amount of the monthly assistance that a participating jurisdiction may pay to, or on behalf of, a family may not exceed the difference between a rent standard for the unit size established by the participating jurisdiction and 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.</P>
              <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction must establish a minimum tenant contribution to rent.</P>
              <P>(3) The participating jurisdiction's rent standard for a unit size must be based on:</P>
              <P>(i) Local market conditions; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (24 CFR part 982).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Housing quality standards.</E> Housing occupied by a family receiving tenant-based assistance under this section must meet the requirements set forth in 24 CFR 982.401. The participating jurisdiction must inspect the housing initially and re-inspect it annually.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Security deposits.</E> (1) A participating jurisdiction may use HOME funds provided for tenant-based rental assistance to provide loans or grants to very low- and low-income families for security deposits for rental of dwelling units whether or not the participating jurisdiction provides any other tenant-based rental assistance under this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The relevant State or local definition of “security deposit” in the jurisdiction where the unit is located is applicable for the purposes of this part, except that the amount of HOME funds that may be provided for a security deposit may not exceed the equivalent of two month's rent for the unit.</P>
              <P>(3) Only the prospective tenant may apply for HOME security deposit assistance, although the participating jurisdiction may pay the funds directly to the tenant or to the landlord.</P>
              <P>(4) HOME funds for security deposits may be provided as a grant or as a loan. If they are provided as a loan, the loan repayments are program income to be used in accordance with § 92.503.</P>
              <P>(5) Paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) of this section are applicable to HOME security deposit assistance, except that income determinations pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section and Housing Quality Standard inspections pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section are required only at the time the security deposit assistance is provided.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Program operation.</E> A tenant-based rental assistance program must be operated consistent with the requirements of this section. The participating jurisdiction may operate the program itself, or may contract with a PHA or other entity with the capacity to operate a rental assistance program. The tenant-based rental assistance may be provided through an assistance contract to an owner that leases a unit to an assisted family or directly to the family. In either case, the participating jurisdiction (or entity operating the program) must approve the lease.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Use of Section 8 assistance.</E> In any case where assistance under section 8 of the 1937 Act becomes available, recipients of tenant-based rental assistance under this part will qualify for tenant selection preferences to the same extent as when they received the HOME tenant-based rental assistance under this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Troubled HOME-assisted rental housing projects.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply only to an existing HOME- assisted rental project that, within the HOME period of affordability, is no longer financially viable. For purposes of this section, a HOME assisted rental project is no longer financially viable if its operating costs significantly exceed its operating revenue. HUD may approve one or both of the actions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to strategically preserve a rental project after consideration of market needs, available resources, and the likelihood of long-term viability of the project.<PRTPAGE P="563"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Notwithstanding § 92.214, a participating jurisdiction may request and HUD may permit, pursuant to a written memorandum of agreement, a participating jurisdiction to invest additional HOME funds in the existing HOME-assisted rental project. The total HOME funding for the project (original investment plus additional investment) must not exceed the per-unit subsidy limit in § 92.250(a). The use of HOME funds may include, but is not limited to, rehabilitation of the HOME units and recapitalization of project reserves for the HOME units (to fund capital costs). If additional HOME funds are invested, HUD may require the period of affordability to be extended, based on such considerations as the amount of additional HOME funds or additional units.</P>
              <P>(c) HUD Headquarters may, through written approval, permit the participating jurisdiction to reduce the number of HOME-assisted units, if the project contains more than the minimum number of units required to be designated as HOME-assisted under § 92.205(d). In determining whether to permit a reduction in the number of HOME-assisted units, HUD will take into account the required period of affordability and the amount of HOME assistance provided to the project.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Before the effective date of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, the participating jurisdiction may incur costs which may be charged to the HOME allocation after the award of the HOME allocation, provided the costs are in compliance with the requirements of this part (including environmental review requirements) and with the statutory and regulatory requirements in effect at the time the costs are charged to the HOME allocation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative and planning costs.</E> Eligible administrative and planning costs may be incurred as of the beginning of the participating jurisdiction's consolidated program year (see 24 CFR 91.10) or the date the consolidated plan describing the HOME allocation to which the costs will be charged is received by HUD, whichever is later.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Project costs.</E> Eligible project costs may be incurred during the current program year in an amount not to exceed 25% of the current HOME allocation amount, to be charged to the following year's HOME allocation. Before incurring the pre-award costs, the participating jurisdiction must comply with its citizen participation plan requirements addressing 24 CFR 91.105(b)(2), (4), (5) and (g) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.115(b)(2), (4), (5) and (f) (States). In lieu of a full action plan, the participating jurisdiction may develop a mini-action plan which describes the proposed pre-award projects and costs in accordance with 24 CFR 91.220(c) and includes, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.220(g)(2) (local governments) or 24 CFR 91.320(c) and, if applicable, 24 CFR 91.320(g)(2) (States). The mini-action plan must state that HOME funding for the project(s) is subject to the future availability of HOME funds. The subsequent action plan (i.e., action plan for the HOME allocation to which the costs will be charged) must also include the use of HOME funds contained in the mini-action plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Form of matching contribution.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible forms.</E> Matching contributions must be made from nonfederal resources and may be in the form of one or more of the following:<PRTPAGE P="567"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Cash contributions from nonfederal sources.</E> To be recognized as a cash contribution, funds must be contributed permanently to the HOME program (or to affordable housing not assisted with HOME funds), regardless of the form of investment provided to the project. Therefore, to receive match credit for the full amount of a loan to a HOME project, all repayment, interest, or other return on investment of the contribution must be deposited in the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to be used for eligible HOME activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. A cash contribution to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds must be contributed permanently to the project. Repayments of matching contributions in affordable housing projects, as defined in § 92.219(b), that are not HOME-assisted, must be made to the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to get match credit for the full loan amount.</P>
              <P>(i) A cash contribution may be made by the participating jurisdiction, non-Federal public entities, private entities, or individuals, except as prohibited under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A cash contribution made to a nonprofit organization for use in a HOME project may be counted as a matching contribution.</P>
              <P>(ii) A cash contribution may be made from program income (as defined by 2 CFR 200.80) from a Federal grant earned after the end of the award period if no Federal requirements govern the disposition of the program income. Included in this category are repayments from closed out grants under the Urban Development Action Grant Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart G) and the Housing Development Grant Program (24 CFR part 850), and from the Rental Rehabilitation Grant Program (24 CFR part 511) after all fiscal year Rental Rehabilitation grants have been closed out.</P>
              <P>(iii) The grant equivalent of a below-market interest rate loan to the project that is not repayable to the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund may be counted as a cash contribution, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If the loan is made from funds borrowed by a jurisdiction or public agency or corporation the contribution is the present discounted cash value of the difference between the payments to be made on the borrowed funds and payments to be received from the loan to the project based on a discount rate equal to the interest rate on the borrowed funds.</P>
              <P>(B) If the loan is made from funds other than funds borrowed by a jurisdiction or public agency or corporation, the contribution is the present discounted cash value of the yield foregone. In determining the yield foregone, the participating jurisdiction must use as a measure of a market rate yield one of the following, as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) With respect to one- to four-unit housing financed with a fixed interest rate mortgage, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 200 basis points;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) With respect to one- to four-unit housing financed with an adjustable interest rate mortgage, a rate equal to the one-year Treasury bill rate plus 250 basis points;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) With respect to a multifamily project, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 300 basis points; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) With respect to housing receiving financing for rehabilitation, a rate equal to the 10-year Treasury note rate plus 400 basis points.</P>
              <P>(iv) Proceeds of bonds that are not repaid with revenue from an affordable housing project (e.g., general obligation bonds) and that are loaned to a HOME-assisted or other qualified affordable housing project constitute a cash contribution under this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(v) A cash contribution may be counted as a matching contribution only if it is used for costs eligible under §§ 92.206 or 92.209, or for the following (which are not HOME eligible costs): the cost of removing and relocating an ECHO housing unit during the period of affordability in accordance with § 92.258(d)(3)(ii), payments to a project reserve account beyond payments permitted by § 92.206(d)(5), operating subsidies, or costs relating to the portion of a mixed-income or mixed-<PRTPAGE P="568"/>use HOME-assisted project not related to the affordable housing units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Forbearance of fees</E>—(i) <E T="03">State and local taxes, charges or fees.</E> The value (based on customary and reasonable means for establishing value) of State or local taxes, fees, or other charges that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by a State or local government on all transactions or projects in the conduct of its operations, which are waived, foregone, or deferred (including State low-income housing tax credits) in a manner that achieves affordability of HOME-assisted projects, may be counted as match. The amount of any real estate taxes may be based on post-improvement property value. For taxes, fees, or charges that are forgiven for future years, the value is the present discounted cash value, based on a rate equal to the rate for the Treasury security with a maturity closest to the number of years for which the taxes, fees, or charges are waived, foregone, or deferred.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other charges or fees.</E> The value of fees or charges associated with the transfer or development of real estate that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by public or private entities, which are waived or foregone, in whole or in part, in a manner that achieves affordability of HOME-assisted projects, may be counted as match. Fees and charges under this paragraph do not include fees or charges for legal or other professional services; professional services which are donated, in whole or in part, are an eligible matching contribution in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) Fees or charges that are associated with the HOME Program only (rather than normally and customarily imposed or charged on all transactions or projects) are not eligible forms of matching contributions.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Donated Real Property.</E> The value, before the HOME assistance is provided and minus any debt burden, lien, or other encumbrance, of donated land or other real property may be counted as match. The donation may be made by the participating jurisdiction, non-Federal public entities, private entities, or individuals, except as prohibited under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Donated property not acquired with Federal resources is a contribution in the amount of 100% of the value.</P>
              <P>(ii) Donated property acquired with Federal assistance may provide a partial contribution as follows. The property must be acquired with Federal assistance specifically for a HOME project (or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to § 92.219(b)(2)). The property must be acquired with the Federal assistance at demonstrably below the appraised value and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation to affordable housing at the time of the acquisition with the Federal assistance. The amount of the contribution is the difference between the acquisition price and the appraised value at the time of acquisition with the Federal assistance. If the property is acquired with the Federal assistance by someone other than the HOME project (or affordable housing) owner, to continue to qualify as a contribution, the property must be given to the HOME project (or affordable housing) owner at a price that does not exceed the amount of the Federal assistance used to acquire the property.</P>
              <P>(iii) Property must be appraised in conformance with established and generally recognized appraisal practice and procedures in common use by professional appraisers. Opinions of value must be based on the best available data properly analyzed and interpreted. The appraisal of land and structures must be performed by an independent, certified appraiser.</P>
              <P>(4) The cost, not paid with Federal resources, of on-site and off-site infrastructure that the participating jurisdiction documents are directly required for HOME-assisted projects. The infrastructure must have been completed no earlier than 12 months before HOME funds are committed to the project.</P>

              <P>(5) Proceeds from multifamily and single family affordable housing project bond financing validly issued by a State or local government, or an agency or instrumentality of a State or <PRTPAGE P="569"/>local government or a political subdivision of a State and repayable with revenues from the affordable housing project financed as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Fifty percent of the loan amount made from bond proceeds to a multifamily affordable housing project owner may qualify as match.</P>
              <P>(ii) Twenty-five percent of the loan amount from bond proceeds made to a single-family affordable housing project owner may qualify as match.</P>
              <P>(iii) Loans made from bond proceeds may not constitute more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total annual match contribution.</P>
              <P>(6) The reasonable value of donated site-preparation and construction materials, not acquired with Federal resources. The value of site-preparation and construction materials is to be determined in accordance with the participating jurisdiction's cost estimate procedures.</P>
              <P>(7) The reasonable rental value of the donated use of site preparation or construction equipment.</P>
              <P>(8) The value of donated or voluntary labor or professional services (see § 92.354(b)) in connection with the provision of affordable housing. A single rate established by HUD shall be applicable for determining the value of unskilled labor. The value of skilled labor or professional services shall be determined by the rate that the individual or entity performing the labor or service normally charges.</P>
              <P>(9) The value of sweat equity (see § 92.354(c)) provided to a homeownership project, under an established component of a participating jurisdiction's program, up until the time of project completion (i.e., submission of a project completion form). Such labor shall be valued at the rate established for unskilled labor at paragraph (a)(8) of this section.</P>
              <P>(10) The direct cost of supportive services provided to families residing in HOME-assisted units during the period of affordability or receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance during the term of the tenant-based rental assistance contract. The supportive services must be necessary to facilitate independent living or be required as part of a self-sufficiency program. Examples of supportive services include: case management, mental health services, assistance with the tasks of daily living, substance abuse treatment and counseling, day care, and job training and counseling.</P>
              <P>(11) The direct cost of homebuyer counseling services provided to families that acquire properties with HOME funds under the provisions of § 92.254(a), including ongoing counseling services provided during the period of affordability. These services may be provided as part of a homebuyer counseling program that is not specific to the HOME Program, but only the cost of services to families that complete purchases with HOME assistance may be counted as match.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Ineligible forms.</E> The following are examples that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and do not count toward meeting a participating jurisdiction's matching contribution requirement:</P>
              <P>(1) Contributions made with or derived from Federal resources or funds, regardless of when the Federal resources or funds were received or expended. CDBG funds (defined in 24 CFR 570.3) are Federal funds for this purpose;</P>
              <P>(2) The interest rate subsidy attributable to the Federal tax-exemption on financing or the value attributable to Federal tax credits;</P>
              <P>(3) Owner equity or investment in a project; and</P>
              <P>(4) Cash or other forms of contributions from applicants for or recipients of HOME assistance or contracts, or investors who own, are working on, or are proposing to apply for assistance for a HOME-assisted project. The prohibition in this paragraph (b)(4) does not apply to contractors (who do not own any HOME project) contributing professional services in accordance with paragraph (a)(8) of this section or to persons contributing sweat equity in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Qualification as affordable housing: Rental housing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The HOME-assisted units in a rental housing project must be occupied by households that are eligible as low- income families and must meet the requirements of this section to qualify as affordable housing. If the housing is not occupied by eligible tenants within six months following the date of project completion, HUD will require the participating jurisdiction to submit marketing information and, if appropriate, submit a marketing plan. HUD will require the participating jurisdiction to repay HOME funds invested in any housing unit that has not been rented to eligible tenants 18 months after the date of project completion. The affordability requirements also apply to the HOME- assisted non-owner-occupied units in single-family housing purchased with HOME funds in accordance with § 92.254. The tenant must have a written lease that complies with § 92.253.</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Rent limitation.</E> HUD provides the following maximum HOME rent limits. The rent limits apply to the rent plus the utilities or the utility allowance. <PRTPAGE P="577"/>The maximum HOME rents (High HOME Rents) are the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(1) The fair market rent for existing housing for comparable units in the area as established by HUD under 24 CFR 888.111; or</P>
            <P>(2) A rent that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose annual income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for number of bedrooms in the unit. The HOME rent limits provided by HUD will include average occupancy per unit and adjusted income assumptions.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional rent limitations (Low HOME Rents).</E> The participating jurisdiction may designate (in its written agreement with the project owner) more than the minimum HOME units in a rental housing project, regardless of project size, to have Low HOME Rents that meet the requirements of this paragraph (b). In rental projects with five or more HOME-assisted rental units, at least 20 percent of the HOME-assisted units must be occupied by very low-income families and meet one of the following rent requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The rent does not exceed 30 percent of the annual income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for smaller and larger families. HUD provides the HOME rent limits which include average occupancy per unit and adjusted income assumptions. However, if the rent determined under this paragraph is higher than the applicable rent under paragraph (a) of this section, then the maximum rent for units under this paragraph is that calculated under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The rent does not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted income. If the unit receives Federal or State project-based rental subsidy and the very low-income family pays as a contribution toward rent not more than 30 percent of the family's adjusted income, then the maximum rent (i.e., tenant contribution plus project-based rental subsidy) is the rent allowable under the Federal or State project-based rental subsidy program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional rent limitations for SRO projects.</E> (1) For SRO units that have both sanitary and food preparation facilities, the maximum HOME rent is based on the zero-bedroom fair market rent. The project must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For SRO units that have no sanitary or food preparation facilities or only one of the two, the maximum HOME rent is based on 75 percent of the zero-bedroom fair market rent. The project is not required to have low HOME rents in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, but must meet the occupancy requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Initial rent schedule and utility allowances.</E> (1) The participating jurisdiction must establish maximum monthly allowances for utilities and services (excluding telephone) and update the allowances annually. The participating jurisdiction must use the HUD Utility Schedule Model or otherwise determine the utility allowance for the project based on the type of utilities used at the project.</P>
            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction must review and approve rents proposed by the owner for units, subject to the maximum rent limitations in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section. For all units subject to the maximum rent limitations in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section for which the tenant is paying utilities and services, the participating jurisdiction must ensure that the rents do not exceed the maximum rent minus the monthly allowances for utilities and services.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Periods of affordability.</E> The HOME-assisted units must meet the affordability requirements for not less than the applicable period specified in the following table, beginning after project completion.</P>
            <P>(1) The affordability requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) Apply without regard to the term of any loan or mortgage, repayment of the HOME investment, or the transfer of ownership;</P>

            <P>(ii) Must be imposed by a deed restriction, a covenant running with the land, an agreement restricting the use of the property, or other mechanisms approved by HUD and must give the participating jurisdiction the right to require specific performance (except that the participating jurisdiction may <PRTPAGE P="578"/>provide that the affordability restrictions may terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure); and</P>
            <P>(iii) Must be recorded in accordance with State recordation laws.</P>
            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to preserve affordability.</P>
            <P>(3) The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family or business ties, obtains an ownership interest in the project or property.</P>
            <P>(4) The termination of the restrictions on the project does not terminate the participating jurisdiction's repayment obligation under § 92.503(b).</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Subsequent rents during the affordability period.</E> (1) The maximum HOME rent limits are recalculated on a periodic basis after HUD determines fair market rents and median incomes. HUD then provides the new maximum HOME rent limits to participating jurisdictions. Regardless of changes in fair market rents and in median income over time, the HOME rents for a project are not required to be lower than the HOME rent limits for the project in effect at the time of project commitment.</P>
            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction must provide project owners with information on updated HOME rent limits so that rents may be adjusted (not to exceed the maximum HOME rent limits in paragraph (f)(1) of this section) in accordance with the written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the owner. Owners must annually provide the participating jurisdiction with information on rents and occupancy of HOME-assisted units to demonstrate compliance with this section. The participating jurisdiction must review rents for compliance and approve or disapprove them every year.</P>
            <P>(3) Any increase in rents for HOME-assisted units is subject to the provisions of outstanding leases, and in any event, the owner must provide tenants of those units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementing any increase in rents.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Adjustment of HOME rent limits for an existing project.</E> (1) Changes in fair market rents and in median income over time should be sufficient to maintain the financial viability of a project within the HOME rent limits in this section.</P>
            <P>(2) HUD may adjust the HOME rent limits for a project, only if HUD finds that an adjustment is necessary to support the continued financial viability of the project and only by an amount that HUD determines is necessary to maintain continued financial viability of the project. HUD expects that this authority will be used sparingly.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Tenant income.</E> The income of each tenant must be determined initially in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(i). In addition, each year during the period of affordability the project owner must re-examine each tenant's annual income in accordance with one of the options in § 92.203 selected by the participating jurisdiction. An owner of a multifamily project with an affordability period of 10 years or more who re-examines tenant's annual income through a statement and certification in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(ii), must examine the income of each tenant, in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(i), every sixth year of the affordability period. Otherwise, an owner who accepts <PRTPAGE P="579"/>the tenant's statement and certification in accordance with § 92.203(a)(1)(ii) is not required to examine the income of tenants in multifamily or single-family projects unless there is evidence that the tenant's written statement failed to completely and accurately state information about the family's size or income.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Over-income tenants.</E> (1) HOME-assisted units continue to qualify as affordable housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to HUD are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.</P>
            <P>(2) Tenants who no longer qualify as low-income families must pay as rent the lesser of the amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or 30 percent of the family's adjusted income, except that tenants of HOME-assisted units that have been allocated low-income housing tax credits by a housing credit agency pursuant to section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 42) must pay rent governed by section 42. In addition, in projects in which the Home units are designated as floating pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, tenants who no longer qualify as low-income are not required to pay as rent an amount that exceeds the market rent for comparable, unassisted units in the neighborhood.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Fixed and floating HOME units.</E> In a project containing HOME-assisted and other units, the participating jurisdiction may designate fixed or floating HOME units. This designation must be made at the time of project commitment in the written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the owner, and the HOME units must be identified not later than the time of initial unit occupancy. Fixed units remain the same throughout the period of affordability. Floating units are changed to maintain conformity with the requirements of this section during the period of affordability so that the total number of housing units meeting the requirements of this section remains the same, and each substituted unit is comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the originally designated HOME-assisted unit.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> The tenants must be selected in accordance with § 92.253(d).</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lease.</E> There must be a written lease between the tenant and the owner of rental housing assisted with HOME funds that is for a period of not less than 1 year, unless by mutual agreement between the tenant and the owner a shorter period is specified. The lease must incorporate the VAWA lease term/addendum required under § 92.359(e), except as otherwise provided by § 92.359(b).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibited lease terms.</E> The lease may not contain any of the following provisions:</P>

            <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment of property.</E> Agreement by the tenant that the owner may take, hold, or sell personal property of household members without notice to the tenant and a court decision on the rights of the parties. This prohibition, however, does not apply to an agreement by the tenant concerning disposition of personal property remaining in the housing unit after the tenant has moved out of the unit. The owner may dispose of this personal property in accordance with State law;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Excusing owner from responsibility.</E> Agreement by the tenant not to hold the owner or the owner's agents legally responsible for any action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent;</P>

            <P>(8) <E T="03">Tenant chargeable with cost of legal actions regardless of outcome.</E> Agreement by the tenant to pay attorney's fees or other legal costs even if the tenant wins in a court proceeding by the owner against the tenant. The tenant, however, may be obligated to pay costs if the tenant loses; and</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of tenancy.</E> An owner may not terminate the tenancy or refuse to renew the lease of a tenant of rental housing assisted with HOME funds, except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease; for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law; for completion of the tenancy period for transitional housing or failure to follow any required transitional housing supportive services plan; or for other good cause. Good cause does not include an increase in the tenant's income or refusal of the tenant to purchase the housing. To terminate or refuse to renew tenancy, the owner must serve written notice upon the tenant specifying the grounds for the action at least 30 days before the termination of tenancy.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> An owner of rental housing assisted with HOME funds must comply with the affirmative marketing requirements established by the participating jurisdiction pursuant to § 92.351(a). The owner must adopt and follow written tenant selection policies and criteria that:</P>
            <P>(1) Limit the housing to very low- income and low-income families;</P>
            <P>(2) Are reasonably related to the applicants' ability to perform the obligations of the lease (i.e., to pay the rent, not to damage the housing; not to interfere with the rights and quiet enjoyment of other tenants);</P>
            <P>(3) Limit eligibility or give a preference to a particular segment of the population if permitted in its written agreement with the participating jurisdiction (and only if the limitation or preference is described in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan).</P>
            <P>(i) Any limitation or preference must not violate nondiscrimination requirements in § 92.350. A limitation or preference does not violate nondiscrimination requirements if the housing also receives funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population (e.g., the Housing Opportunity for Persons with AIDS program under 24 CFR part 574, the Shelter Plus Care program under 24 CFR part 582, the Supportive Housing program under 24 CFR part 583, supportive housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities under 24 CFR part 891), and the limit or preference is tailored to serve that segment of the population.</P>
            <P>(ii) If a project does not receive funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population, the project may have a limitation or preference for persons with disabilities who need services offered at a project only if:</P>
            <P>(A) The limitation or preference is limited to the population of families (including individuals) with disabilities that significantly interfere with their ability to obtain and maintain housing;</P>
            <P>(B) Such families will not be able to obtain or maintain themselves in housing without appropriate supportive services; and</P>

            <P>(C) Such services cannot be provided in a nonsegregated setting. The families must not be required to accept the services offered at the project. In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the project must be open to all otherwise eligible persons with disabilities who may benefit from the services provided in the project.<PRTPAGE P="581"/>

            <P>(4) Do not exclude an applicant with a certificate or voucher under the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program (24 CFR part 982) or an applicant participating in a HOME tenant-based rental assistance program because of the status of the prospective tenant as a holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME tenant-based assistance document.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Qualification as affordable housing: Homeownership.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition with or without rehabilitation.</E> Housing that is for acquisition by a family must meet the affordability requirements of this paragraph (a).</P>
            <P>(1) The housing must be single family housing.</P>
            <P>(2) The housing must be modest housing as follows:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of acquisition of newly constructed housing or standard housing, the housing has a purchase price for the type of single family housing that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) In the case of acquisition with rehabilitation, the housing has an estimated value after rehabilitation that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(iii) If a participating jurisdiction intends to use HOME funds for homebuyer assistance or for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied single- family properties, the participating jurisdiction must use the HOME affordable homeownership limits provided by HUD for newly constructed housing and for existing housing. HUD will provide limits for affordable newly constructed housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage program data for newly constructed housing, with a minimum limit based on 95 percent of the U.S. median purchase price for new construction for nonmetropolitan areas. HUD will provide limits for affordable existing housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using Federal FHA single family mortgage program data for existing housing data and other appropriate data that are available nation-wide for sales of existing housing, with a minimum limit based on 95 percent of the state-wide nonmetropolitan area median purchase price using this data. In lieu of the limits provided by HUD, the participating jurisdiction may determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price for single family housing in the jurisdiction annually, as follows. The participating jurisdiction must set forth the price for different types of single family housing for the jurisdiction. The participating jurisdiction may determine separate limits for existing housing and newly constructed housing. For housing located outside of metropolitan areas, a State may aggregate sales data from more than one county, if the counties are contiguous and similarly situated. The following information must be included in the annual action plan of the Consolidated Plan submitted to HUD for review and updated in each action plan.</P>
            <P>(A) The 95 percent of median area purchase price must be established in accordance with a market analysis that ensured that a sufficient number of recent housing sales are included in the survey.</P>
            <P>(B) Sales must cover the requisite number of months based on volume: For 500 or more sales per month, a one- month reporting period; for 250 through 499 sales per month, a 2-month reporting period; for less than 250 sales per month, at least a 3-month reporting period. The data must be listed in ascending order of sales price.</P>

            <P>(C) The address of the listed properties must include the location within the participating jurisdiction. Lot, <PRTPAGE P="582"/>square, and subdivision data may be substituted for the street address.</P>
            <P>(D) The housing sales data must reflect all, or nearly all, of the one- family house sales in the entire participating jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(E) To determine the median, take the middle sale on the list if an odd number of sales, and if an even number, take the higher of the middle numbers and consider it the median. After identifying the median sales price, the amount should be multiplied by 0.95 to determine the 95 percent of the median area purchase price.</P>
            <P>(3) The housing must be acquired by a homebuyer whose family qualifies as a low-income family, and the housing must be the principal residence of the family throughout the period described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If there is no ratified sales contract with an eligible homebuyer for the housing within 9 months of the date of completion of construction or rehabilitation, the housing must be rented to an eligible tenant in accordance with § 92.252. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the participating jurisdiction must include the income of all persons living in the housing. The homebuyer must receive housing counseling.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Periods of affordability.</E> The HOME-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not less than the applicable period specified in the following table, beginning after project completion. The per unit amount of HOME funds and the affordability period that they trigger are described more fully in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) (resale) and (ii) (recapture) of this section.</P>

            <P>(5) <E T="03">Resale and recapture.</E> The participating jurisdiction must establish the resale or recapture requirements that comply with the standards of this section and set forth the requirements in its consolidated plan. HUD must determine that they are appropriate and must specifically approve them in writing.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Resale.</E> Resale requirements must ensure, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability that the housing is made available for subsequent purchase only to a buyer whose family qualifies as a low-income family and will use the property as the family's principal residence. The resale requirement must also ensure that the price at resale provides the original HOME-assisted owner a fair return on investment (including the homeowner's investment and any capital improvement) and ensure that the housing will remain affordable to a reasonable range of low- income homebuyers. The participating jurisdiction must specifically define “fair return on investment” and “affordability to a reasonable range of low-income homebuyers,” and specifically address how it will make the housing affordable to a low-income homebuyer in the event that the resale price necessary to provide fair return is not affordable to the subsequent buyer. The period of affordability is based on the total amount of HOME funds invested in the housing.</P>
            <P>(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(B) of this section, deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar mechanisms must be used as the mechanism to impose the resale requirements. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure or assignment of an FHA insured mortgage to HUD. The participating jurisdiction may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the housing.</P>

            <P>(B) Certain housing may be presumed to meet the resale restrictions (i.e., the <PRTPAGE P="583"/>housing will be available and affordable to a reasonable range of low-income homebuyers; a low-income homebuyer will occupy the housing as the family's principal residence; and the original owner will be afforded a fair return on investment) during the period of affordability without the imposition of enforcement mechanisms by the participating jurisdiction. The presumption must be based upon a market analysis of the neighborhood in which the housing is located. The market analysis must include an evaluation of the location and characteristics of the housing and residents in the neighborhood (e.g., sale prices, age and amenities of the housing stock, incomes of residents, percentage of owner-occupants) in relation to housing and incomes in the housing market area. An analysis of the current and projected incomes of neighborhood residents for an average period of affordability for homebuyers in the neighborhood must support the conclusion that a reasonable range of low-income families will continue to qualify for mortgage financing. For example, an analysis shows that the housing is modestly priced within the housing market area and that families with incomes of 65% to 80% of area median can afford monthly payments under average FHA terms without other government assistance and housing will remain affordable at least during the next five to seven years compared to other housing in the market area; the size and amenities of the housing are modest and substantial rehabilitation will not significantly increase the market value; the neighborhood has housing that is not currently owned by the occupants, but the participating jurisdiction is encouraging homeownership in the neighborhood by providing homeownership assistance and by making improvements to the streets, sidewalks, and other public facilities and services. If a participating jurisdiction in preparing a neighborhood revitalization strategy under § 91.215(e)(2) of its consolidated plan or Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community application under 24 CFR part 597 has incorporated the type of market data described above, that submission may serve as the required analysis under this section. If the participating jurisdiction continues to provide homeownership assistance for housing in the neighborhood, it must periodically update the market analysis to verify the original presumption of continued affordability.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Recapture.</E> Recapture provisions must ensure that the participating jurisdiction recoups all or a portion of the HOME assistance to the homebuyers, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability. The participating jurisdiction may structure its recapture provisions based on its program design and market conditions. The period of affordability is based upon the total amount of HOME funds subject to recapture described in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">5</E>) of this section. Recapture provisions may permit the subsequent homebuyer to assume the HOME assistance (subject to the HOME requirements for the remainder of the period of affordability) if the subsequent homebuyer is low-income, and no additional HOME assistance is provided.</P>
            <P>(A) The following options for recapture requirements are acceptable to HUD. The participating jurisdiction may adopt, modify or develop its own recapture requirements for HUD approval. In establishing its recapture requirements, the participating jurisdiction is subject to the limitation that when the recapture requirement is triggered by a sale (voluntary or involuntary) of the housing unit, the amount recaptured cannot exceed the net proceeds, if any. The net proceeds are the sales price minus superior loan repayment (other than HOME funds) and any closing costs.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) <E T="03">Recapture entire amount.</E> The participating jurisdiction may recapture the entire amount of the HOME investment from the homeowner.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) <E T="03">Reduction during affordability period.</E> The participating jurisdiction may reduce the HOME investment amount to be recaptured on a prorata basis for the time the homeowner has owned and occupied the housing measured against the required affordability period.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) <E T="03">Shared net proceeds.</E> If the net proceeds are not sufficient to recapture <PRTPAGE P="584"/>the full HOME investment (or a reduced amount as provided for in paragraph (a)(5)(ii)(A)(2) of this section) plus enable the homeowner to recover the amount of the homeowner's downpayment and any capital improvement investment made by the owner since purchase, the participating jurisdiction may share the net proceeds. The net proceeds are the sales price minus loan repayment (other than HOME funds) and closing costs. The net proceeds may be divided proportionally as set forth in the following mathematical formulas:</P>
            <MATH DEEP="47" SPAN="2">
              <MID>EC12OC91.007</MID>
            </MATH>
            <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) <E T="03">Owner investment returned first.</E> The participating jurisdiction may permit the homebuyer to recover the homebuyer's entire investment (downpayment and capital improvements made by the owner since purchase) before recapturing the HOME investment.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) <E T="03">Amount subject to recapture.</E> The HOME investment that is subject to recapture is based on the amount of HOME assistance that enabled the homebuyer to buy the dwelling unit. This includes any HOME assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price, but excludes the amount between the cost of producing the unit and the market value of the property (i.e., the development subsidy). The recaptured funds must be used to carry out HOME-eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the HOME assistance is only used for the development subsidy and therefore not subject to recapture, the resale option must be used.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Special considerations for single-family properties with more than one unit.</E> If the HOME funds are only used to assist a low-income homebuyer to acquire one unit in single-family housing containing more than one unit and the assisted unit will be the principal residence of the homebuyer, the affordability requirements of this section apply only to the assisted unit. If HOME funds are also used to assist the low-income homebuyer to acquire one or more of the rental units in the single-family housing, the affordability requirements of § 92.252 apply to assisted rental units, except that the participating jurisdiction may impose resale or recapture restrictions on all assisted units (owner-occupied and rental units) in the single family housing. If resale restrictions are used, the affordability requirements on all assisted units continue for the period of affordability. If recapture restrictions are used, the affordability requirements on the assisted rental units may be terminated, at the discretion of the participating jurisdiction, upon recapture of the HOME investment. (If HOME funds are used to assist only the rental units in such a property then the requirements of § 92.252 would apply and the owner-occupied unit would not be subject to the income targeting or affordability provisions of § 92.254.)</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Lease-purchase.</E> HOME funds may be used to assist homebuyers through lease-purchase programs for existing housing and for housing to be constructed. The housing must be purchased by a homebuyer within 36 months of signing the lease'purchase agreement. The homebuyer must qualify as a low-income family at the time the lease-purchase agreement is signed. If HOME funds are used to acquire housing that will be resold to a homebuyer through a lease-purchase program, the HOME affordability requirements for rental housing in § 92.252 shall apply if the housing is not transferred to a homebuyer within forty-two months after project completion.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Contract to purchase.</E> If HOME funds are used to assist a homebuyer <PRTPAGE P="585"/>who has entered into a contract to purchase housing to be constructed, the homebuyer must qualify as a low-income family at the time the contract is signed.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Preserving affordability of housing that was previously assisted with HOME funds.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(i) To preserve the affordability of HOME-assisted housing a participating jurisdiction may use additional HOME funds for the following costs:</P>
            <P>(A) The cost to acquire the housing through a purchase option, right of first refusal, or other preemptive right before foreclosure, or at the foreclosure sale. (The foreclosure costs to acquire housing with a HOME loan in default are eligible. However, HOME funds may not be used to repay a loan made with HOME funds.)</P>
            <P>(B) The cost to undertake any necessary rehabilitation for the housing acquired.</P>
            <P>(C) The cost of owning/holding the housing pending resale to another homebuyer.</P>
            <P>(D) The cost to assist another homebuyer in purchasing the housing.</P>
            <P>(ii) When a participating jurisdiction uses HOME funds to preserve the affordability of such housing, the additional investment must be treated as an amendment to the original project. The housing must be sold to a new eligible homebuyer in accordance with the requirements of § 92.254(a) within a reasonable period of time.</P>
            <P>(iii) The total amount of the original and additional HOME assistance may not exceed the maximum per unit subsidy amount established under § 92.250. Alternatively to charging the cost to the HOME program under § 92.206, the participating jurisdiction may charge the cost to the HOME program under § 92.207 as a reasonable administrative cost of its HOME program, so that the additional HOME funds for the housing are not subject to the maximum per-unit subsidy amount. To the extent administrative funds are used, they may be reimbursed, in whole or in part, when the housing is sold to a new eligible homebuyer.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rehabilitation not involving acquisition.</E> Housing that is currently owned by a family qualifies as affordable housing only if:</P>
            <P>(1) The estimated value of the property, after rehabilitation, does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section; and</P>
            <P>(2) The housing is the principal residence of an owner whose family qualifies as a low-income family at the time HOME funds are committed to the housing. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the participating jurisdiction must include the income of all persons living in the housing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Ownership interest.</E> The ownership in the housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of “homeownership” in § 92.2, except that housing that is rehabilitated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may also include inherited property with multiple owners, life estates, living trusts and beneficiary deeds under the following conditions. The participating jurisdiction has the right to establish the terms of assistance.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Inherited property.</E> Inherited property with multiple owners: Housing for which title has been passed to several individuals by inheritance, but not all heirs reside in the housing, sharing ownership with other nonresident heirs. (The occupant of the housing has a divided ownership interest.) The participating jurisdiction may assist the owner-occupant if the occupant is low-income, occupies the housing as his or her principal residence, and pays all the costs associated with ownership and maintenance of the housing (e.g., mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Life estate.</E> The person who has the life estate has the right to live in the housing for the remainder of his or her life and does not pay rent. The participating jurisdiction may assist the person holding the life estate if the person is low-income and occupies the housing as his or her principal residence.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Inter vivos trust, also known as a living trust.</E> A living trust is created during the lifetime of a person. A living trust is created when the owner of property conveys his or her property to a trust for his or her own benefit or for that of a third party (the beneficiaries). The trust holds legal title and the beneficiary holds equitable <PRTPAGE P="586"/>title. The person may name him or herself as the beneficiary. The trustee is under a fiduciary responsibility to hold and manage the trust assets for the beneficiary. The participating jurisdiction may assist if all beneficiaries of the trust qualify as a low-income family and occupy the property as their principal residence (except that contingent beneficiaries, who receive no benefit from the trust nor have any control over the trust assets until the beneficiary is deceased, need not be low-income). The trust must be valid and enforceable and ensure that each beneficiary has the legal right to occupy the property for the remainder of his or her life.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Beneficiary deed.</E> A beneficiary deed conveys an interest in real property, including any debt secured by a lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the owner. Upon the death of the owner, the grantee beneficiary receives ownership in the property, subject to all conveyances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges, and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the owner was subject during the owner's lifetime. The participating jurisdiction may assist if the owner qualifies as low-income and the owner occupies the property as his or her principal residence.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">New construction without acquisition.</E> Newly constructed housing that is built on property currently owned by a family which will occupy the housing upon completion, qualifies as affordable housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Providing homeownership assistance through lenders.</E> Subject to the requirements of this paragraph (e), the participating jurisdiction may provide homeownership assistance through for-profit or nonprofit lending institutions that provide the first mortgage loan to a low-income family.</P>
            <P>(1) The homeownership assistance may be provided only as specified in a written agreement between the participating jurisdiction and the lender. The written agreement must specify the forms and amounts of homeownership assistance that the participating jurisdiction authorizes the lender to provide to families and any conditions that apply to the provision of such homeownership assistance.</P>
            <P>(2) Before the lender provides any homeownership assistance to a family, the participating jurisdiction must verify that the family is low-income and must inspect the housing for compliance with the property standards in § 92.251.</P>
            <P>(3) No fees (e.g., origination fees or points) may be charged to a family for the HOME homeownership assistance provided pursuant to this paragraph (e), and the participating jurisdiction must determine that the fees and other amounts charged to the family by the lender for the first mortgage financing are reasonable. Reasonable administrative costs may be charged to the HOME program as a project cost. If the participating jurisdiction requires lenders to pay a fee to participate in the HOME program, the fee is program income to the HOME program.</P>
            <P>(4) If the nonprofit lender is a subrecipient or contractor that is receiving HOME assistance to determine that the family is eligible for homeownership assistance, but the participating jurisdiction or another entity is making the assistance to the homebuyer (e.g., signing the documents for the loan or the grant), the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section are applicable.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Homebuyer program policies.</E> The participating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies for:</P>
            <P>(1) Underwriting standards for homeownership assistance that evaluate housing debt and overall debt of the family, the appropriateness of the amount of assistance, monthly expenses of the family, assets available to acquire the housing, and financial resources to sustain homeownership;</P>
            <P>(2) Responsible lending, and</P>

            <P>(3) Refinancing loans to which HOME loans are subordinated to ensure that <PRTPAGE P="587"/>the terms of the new loan are reasonable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Set-aside for community housing development organizations (CHDOs).</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Within 24 months after the date that HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnerships Agreement, the participating jurisdiction must reserve not less than 15 percent of the HOME allocation for investment only in housing to be owned, developed or sponsored by community housing development organizations. For a State, the HOME allocation includes funds reallocated under § 92.451(c)(2)(i) and, for a unit of general local government, includes funds transferred from a State under § 92.102(b). The participating jurisdiction must certify the organization as meeting the definition of “community housing development organization” and must document that the organization has capacity to own, develop, or sponsor housing each time it commits funds to the organization. For purposes of this paragraph:</P>
            <P>(1) Funds are reserved when a participating jurisdiction enters into a written agreement with the community housing development organization (or project owner as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) committing the funds to a specific local project in accordance with paragraph (2) of the definition of “commitment” in § 92.2.</P>
            <P>(2) Rental housing is “owned” by the community housing development organization if the community housing development organization is the owner in fee simple absolute of multifamily or single family housing (or has a long term ground lease) for rental to low-income families in accordance with § 92.252. If the housing is to be rehabilitated or constructed, the community housing development organization hires and oversees the developer that rehabilitates or constructs the housing. At minimum, the community housing development organization must hire or contract with an experienced project manager to oversee all aspects of the development, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME financing, selecting a developer or general contractor, overseeing the progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. The community housing development organization must own the rental housing during development and for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252. If the CHDO acquires housing that meets the property standards in § 92.251, the CHDO must own the rental housing for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252.</P>
            <P>(3) Rental housing is “developed” by the community development housing organization if the community housing development organization is the owner of multifamily or single family housing in fee simple absolute (or has a long term ground lease) and the developer of new housing that will be constructed or existing substandard housing that will be rehabilitated for rent to low-income families in accordance with § 92.252. To be the “developer,” the community development housing organization must be in sole charge of all aspects of the development process, including obtaining zoning, securing non-HOME financing, selecting architects, engineers and general contractors, overseeing the progress of the work and determining the reasonableness of costs. At a minimum, the community housing development organization must own the housing during development and for a period at least equal to the period of affordability in § 92.252.</P>
            <P>(4) Rental housing is “sponsored” by the community development housing organization if it is rental housing “owned” or “developed” by a subsidiary of a community housing development organization, a limited partnership of which the community housing development organization or its subsidiary is the sole general partner, or a limited liability company of which the community housing development organization or its subsidiary is the sole managing member.</P>

            <P>(i) The subsidiary of the community housing development organization may be a for-profit or nonprofit organization and must be wholly owned by the community housing development organization. If the limited partnership or limited liability company agreement permits the community housing development organization to be removed as <PRTPAGE P="589"/>general partner or sole managing member, the agreement must provide that the removal must be for cause and that the community housing development organization must be replaced with another community housing development organization.</P>
            <P>(ii) The HOME funds must be provided to the entity that owns the project.</P>
            <P>(5) HOME-assisted rental housing is also “sponsored” by a community housing development organization if the community housing development organization “developed” the rental housing project that it agrees to convey to an identified private nonprofit organization at a predetermined time after completion of the development of the project. Sponsored rental housing, as provided in this paragraph (a)(5), is subject to the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(i) The private nonprofit organization may not be created by a governmental entity.</P>
            <P>(ii) The HOME funds must be invested in the project that is owned by the community housing development organization.</P>
            <P>(iii) Before commitment of HOME funds, the community housing development organization sponsor must select the nonprofit organization that will obtain ownership of the property.</P>
            <P>(A) The nonprofit organization assumes the community housing development organization's HOME obligations (including any repayment of loans) for the rental project at a specified time after completion of development.</P>
            <P>(B) If the housing is not transferred to the nonprofit organization, the community housing development organization sponsor remains responsible for the HOME assistance and the HOME project.</P>
            <P>(6) Housing for homeownership is “developed” by the community development housing organization if the community housing development organization is the owner (in fee simple absolute) and developer of new housing that will be constructed or existing substandard housing that will be rehabilitated for sale to low-income families in accordance with § 92.254.</P>
            <P>(i) To be the “developer” the community development housing organization must arrange financing of the project and be in sole charge of construction. The community housing development organization may provide direct homeownership assistance (e.g., downpayment assistance) when it sells the housing to low-income families and the community housing development organization will not be considered a subrecipient. The HOME funds for downpayment assistance shall not be greater than 10 percent of the amount of HOME funds for development of the housing.</P>
            <P>(ii) The participating jurisdiction must determine and set forth in its written agreement with the community housing development organization the actual sales prices of the housing or the method by which the sales prices for the housing will be established and whether the proceeds must be returned to the participating jurisdiction or may be retained by the community housing development organization.</P>
            <P>(A) While proceeds that the participating jurisdiction permits the community housing development organization to retain are not subject to the requirements of this part, the participating jurisdiction must specify in the written agreement with the community housing development organization whether the proceeds are to be used for HOME-eligible activities or other housing activities to benefit low-income families.</P>
            <P>(B) Funds that are recaptured because the housing no longer meets the affordability requirements under § 92.254(a)(5)(ii) are subject to the requirements of this part in accordance with § 92.503.</P>
            <P>(7) The participating jurisdiction determines the form of assistance (e.g., grant or loan) that it will provide to the community housing development organization receives or, for rental housing projects under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, to the entity that owns the project.</P>

            <P>(b) Each participating jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to identify community housing development organizations that are capable, or can reasonably be expected to become capable, of carrying out elements of the jurisdiction's approved consolidated plan and to encourage such community housing development organizations to <PRTPAGE P="590"/>do so. If during the first 24 months of its participation in the HOME Program a participating jurisdiction cannot identify a sufficient number of capable community housing development organizations, up to 20 percent of the minimum community housing development organization setaside of 15 percent specified in paragraph (a) of this section, above, (but not more than $150,000 during the 24 month period) may be committed to develop the capacity of community housing development organizations in the jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(c) Up to 10 percent of the HOME funds reserved under this section may be used for activities specified under § 92.301.</P>
            <P>(d) HOME funds required to be reserved under this section are subject to reduction, as provided in § 92.500(d).</P>
            <P>(e) If funds for operating expenses are provided under § 92.208 to a community housing development organization that is not also receiving funds under paragraph (a) of this section for housing to be owned, developed or sponsored by the community housing development organization, the participating jurisdiction's written agreement with the community housing development organization must provide that the community housing development organization is expected to receive funds under paragraph (a) of this section for a project within 24 months of the date of receiving the funds for operating expenses, and specifies the terms and conditions upon which this expectation is based.</P>
            <P>(f) The participating jurisdiction must ensure that a community housing development organization does not receive HOME funding for any fiscal year in an amount that provides more than 50 percent or $50,000, whichever is greater, of the community housing development organization's total operating expenses in that fiscal year. This also includes organizational support and housing education provided under section 233(b)(1), (2), and (6) of the Act, as well as funds for operating expenses provided under § 92.208.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Affirmative marketing.</E> (1) Each participating jurisdiction must adopt and follow affirmative marketing procedures and requirements for rental and homebuyer projects containing five or more HOME-assisted housing units. Affirmative marketing requirements and procedures also apply to all HOME- funded programs, including, but not limited to, tenant-based rental assistance and downpayment assistance programs. Affirmative marketing steps consist of actions to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons in the housing market area to the available housing without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, religion, familial status, or disability. If participating jurisdiction's written agreement with the project owner permits the rental housing project to limit tenant eligibility or to have a tenant preference in accordance with § 92.253(d)(3), the participating jurisdiction must have affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that apply in the context of the limited/preferred tenant eligibility for the project.</P>
            <P>(2) The affirmative marketing requirements and procedures adopted must include:</P>

To the extent feasible, residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex upon completion of the project.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</P>
            <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs.</P>
            <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
            <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
            <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex upon completion of the project; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, the minority person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Displaced Person.</E> (i) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (family individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership or association) that moves from real property or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted with HOME funds. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
            <P>(A) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date of the submission of an application to the participating jurisdiction or HUD, if the applicant has site control and the application is later approved; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The date the jurisdiction approves the applicable site, if the applicant does not have site control at the time of the application; or</P>
            <P>(B) Before the date described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if the jurisdiction or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or</P>
            <P>(C) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering the tenant the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a term of at least one year at a monthly rent and <PRTPAGE P="594"/>estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The tenant's monthly rent before such agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.628, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>

            <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a <E T="03">displaced person</E> if:</P>
            <P>(A) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the participating jurisdiction determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance. The effective date of any termination or refusal to renew must be preceded by at least 30 days advance written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for the action.</P>
            <P>(B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application but, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, incur a rent increase), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
            <P>(C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
            <P>(D) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
            <P>(iii) The jurisdiction may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing replacement housing assistance to be provided under paragraph (c) of this section to a tenant displaced from a dwelling as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition of the real property, the term <E T="03">initiation of negotiations</E> means the execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional relocation assistance.</E> The participating jurisdiction may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms displaced by a project assisted with HOME funds where the displacement is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The jurisdiction may also provide relocation assistance to persons covered under paragraph (c) of this section beyond that required. For any such assistance that is not required by State or local law, the jurisdiction must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the optional relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Residential antidisplacement and relocation assistance plan.</E> The participating jurisdiction shall comply with the requirements of 24 CFR part 42, subpart C.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the participating jurisdiction's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person may be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the jurisdiction. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with <PRTPAGE P="595"/>the jurisdiction's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Every contract for the construction (rehabilitation or new construction) of housing that includes 12 or more units assisted with HOME funds must contain a provision requiring the payment of not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141), to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of any part of the housing. Such contracts must also be subject to the overtime provisions, as applicable, of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).</P>
            <P>(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs in § 92.206, including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted units. When HOME funds are only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single-family housing, and not for any other project costs, the wage provisions apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that HOME funds will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing and the construction contract covers 12 or more housing units to be purchased with HOME assistance. The wage provisions apply to any construction contract that includes a total of 12 or more HOME-assisted units, whether one or more than one project is covered by the construction contract. Once they are determined to be applicable, the wage provisions must be contained in the construction contract so as to cover all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project, including portions other than the assisted units. Arranging multiple construction contracts within a single project for the purpose of avoiding the wage provisions is not permitted.</P>
            <P>(3) Participating jurisdictions, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations issued under these acts and with other Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards, as applicable. Participating jurisdictions shall be responsible for ensuring compliance by contractors and subcontractors with labor standards described in this section. In accordance with procedures specified by HUD, participating jurisdictions shall:</P>
            <P>(i) Ensure that bid and contract documents contain required labor standards provisions and the appropriate Department of Labor wage determinations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Conduct on-site inspections and employee interviews;</P>

            <P>(v) Maintain documentation of administrative and enforcement activities; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Require certification as to compliance with the provisions of this section before making any payment under such contracts.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Volunteers.</E> The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to an individual who receives no compensation or is paid expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee to perform the services for which the individual volunteered and who is not otherwise employed at any time in the construction work. See 24 CFR part 70.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Sweat equity.</E> The prevailing wage provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to members of an eligible family who provide labor in exchange for acquisition of a property for homeownership or provide labor in lieu of, or as a supplement to, rent payments.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions: Threshold requirements.</E> Upon the written request of the participating jurisdiction, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and the effective and efficient administration of the participating jurisdiction's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the participating jurisdiction has provided the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>

            <P>(e) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions.</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the participating jurisdiction has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, HUD will consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
            <P>(5) Whether undue hardship will result either to the participating jurisdiction or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>
            <P>(6) Any other relevant considerations.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Owners and developers.</E> (1) No owner, developer, or sponsor of a project assisted with HOME funds (or officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of the owner, developer, or sponsor or immediate family member or immediate <PRTPAGE P="597"/>family member of an officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of the owner, developer, or sponsor) whether private, for-profit or nonprofit (including a community housing development organization (CHDO) when acting as an owner, developer, or sponsor) may occupy a HOME-assisted affordable housing unit in a project during the required period of affordability specified in § 92.252(e) or § 92.254(a)(4). This provision does not apply to an individual who receives HOME funds to acquire or rehabilitate his or her principal residence or to an employee or agent of the owner or developer of a rental housing project who occupies a housing unit as the project manager or maintenance worker.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Upon written request of a housing owner or developer, the participating jurisdiction (or State recipient, if authorized by the State participating jurisdiction) may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HOME program and the effective and efficient administration of the owner's or developer's HOME-assisted project. In determining whether to grant a requested exception, the participating jurisdiction shall consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the person receiving the benefit is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted housing, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>

            <P>(c) <E T="03">Notification requirements.</E> The participating jurisdiction must provide a notice and certification form that meet the requirements of 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the owner of HOME-assisted rental housing.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">For HOME-assisted units.</E> The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for a HOME-assisted unit at the time the applicant is admitted to a HOME-assisted unit, or denied admission to a HOME-assisted unit based on the owner's tenant selection policies and criteria. The owner of HOME-assisted rental housing must also provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005 with any notification of eviction from a HOME-assisted unit.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">For HOME tenant-based rental assistance.</E> The participating jurisdiction must provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for HOME tenant-based rental assistance when the applicant's HOME tenant-based rental assistance is approved or denied. The participating jurisdiction must also provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to a tenant receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance when the participating jurisdiction provides the tenant with notification of termination of the HOME tenant-based rental assistance, and when the participating jurisdiction learns that the tenant's housing owner intends to provide the tenant with notification of eviction.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Bifurcation of lease requirements.</E> For the purposes of this part, the following requirements shall apply in place of the requirements at 24 CFR 5.2009(b):</P>
            <P>(1) If a family living in a HOME-assisted rental unit separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) may remain in the HOME-assisted unit.</P>
            <P>(2) If a family who is receiving HOME tenant-based rental assistance separates under 24 CFR 5.2009(a), the remaining tenant(s) will retain the HOME tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction must determine whether the tenant that was removed from the unit will receive HOME tenant-based rental assistance.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">VAWA lease term/addendum.</E> The participating jurisdiction must develop a VAWA lease term/addendum to incorporate all requirements that apply to the owner or lease under 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and this section, including the prohibited bases for eviction and restrictions on construing lease terms under 24 CFR 5.2005(b) and (c). This VAWA lease term/addendum must also provide that the tenant may terminate the lease without penalty if the participating jurisdiction determines that the tenant has met the conditions for an emergency transfer under 24 CFR 5.2005(e). When HOME tenant-based rental assistance is provided, the lease term/addendum must require the owner to notify the participating jurisdiction before the owner bifurcates the lease or provides notification of eviction to the tenant. If HOME tenant-based rental assistance is the only assistance provided (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the unit is not receiving project-based assistance under a covered housing program, as defined in 24 <PRTPAGE P="599"/>CFR 5.2003), the VAWA lease term/addendum may be written to expire at the end of the rental assistance period.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Period of applicability.</E> For HOME-assisted rental housing, the requirements of this section shall apply to the owner of the housing for the duration of the affordability period. For HOME tenant-based rental assistance, the requirements of this section shall apply to the owner of the tenant's housing for the period for which the rental assistance is provided.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Emergency Transfer Plan.</E> (1) The participating jurisdiction must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan and must make the determination of whether a tenant qualifies under the plan. The plan must meet the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), as supplemented by this section.</P>
            <P>(2) For the purposes of § 5.2005(e)(7), the required policies must specify that for tenants who qualify for an emergency transfer and who wish to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately available, the participating jurisdiction must provide a list of properties in the jurisdiction that include HOME-assisted units. The list must include the following information for each property: The property's address, contact information, the unit sizes (number of bedrooms) for the HOME-assisted units, and, to the extent known, any tenant preferences or eligibility restrictions for the HOME-assisted units. In addition, the participating jurisdiction may:</P>
            <P>(i) Establish a preference under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program for tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under 24 CFR 5.2005(e);</P>
            <P>(ii) Provide HOME tenant-based rental assistance to tenants who qualify for emergency transfers under 24 CFR 5.2005(e); or</P>
            <P>(iii) Coordinate with victim service providers and advocates to develop the emergency transfer plan, make referrals, and facilitate emergency transfers to safe and available units.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A HOME Investment Trust Fund consists of the accounts described in this section solely for investment in accordance with the provisions of this part. HUD will establish a HOME Investment Trust Fund United States Treasury account for each participating jurisdiction. Each participating jurisdiction may use either a separate local HOME Investment Trust Fund account or, a subsidiary account within its general fund (or other appropriate fund) as the local HOME Investment Trust Fund account.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Treasury Account.</E> The United States Treasury account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes funds allocated to the participating jurisdiction under § 92.50 (including for a local participating jurisdiction, any transfer of the State's allocation pursuant to § 92.102(b)(2)) and funds reallocated to the participating jurisdiction, either by formula or by competition, under subpart J of this part; and</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Local account.</E> (1) The local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund includes deposits of HOME funds disbursed from the Treasury account; the deposit of any State funds (other than HOME funds transferred pursuant to § 92.102(b)(2)) or local funds that enable the jurisdiction to meet the participating threshold amount in § 92.102, any program income (from both the allocated funds and matching contributions in accordance with the definition of program income), and any repayments or recaptured funds as required by § 92.503. The local account must be interest-bearing.</P>
            <P>(2) The participating jurisdiction may establish a second local account of the HOME Investment Trust Funds if:</P>
            <P>(i) The participating jurisdiction has its own affordable housing trust fund that the participating jurisdiction will use for matching contributions to the HOME program;</P>
            <P>(ii) The statute or local ordinance requires repayments from its own trust fund to be made to the trust fund;</P>
            <P>(iii) The participating jurisdiction establishes a separate account within its own trust fund for repayments of the matching contributions; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The funds in the account are used solely for investment in eligible activities within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries in accordance with the provisions of this part, except as provided under § 92.201(a)(2).</P>
            <P>(3) The funds in the local account cannot be used for the matching contribution and do not need to be matched.</P>
            <P>(d)(1) <E T="03">Reductions of Fiscal Year 2015 and subsequent fiscal year allocations.</E> HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund, as follows:</P>

            <P>(i) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not <PRTPAGE P="602"/>committed (including funds for community housing development organizations under § 92.300) within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;</P>
            <P>(ii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that were committed to a State recipient or subrecipient that are not committed to a specific local project within 36 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement for the specific fiscal year allocation;</P>
            <P>(iii) Any funds from a specific fiscal year allocation that are in the United States Treasury account that are not expended (drawn down) by September 30 of the fifth year after the end of the period of availability of the fiscal year allocation for obligation by HUD. Due to end-of-year financial system closeouts that begin before this date and prevent electronic access to the payment system, requests to draw down the funds must be made at least 7 full business days before this date to ensure that the funds still can be drawn from the United States Treasury account through the computerized disbursement and information system; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Any penalties assessed by HUD under § 92.552.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) <E T="03">Reductions of Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations.</E> HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of:</P>

            <P>(A) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are required to be reserved (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> 15 percent of the funds) by a participating jurisdiction, under § 92.300, and which are not committed to a community housing development organization project within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement;</P>
            <P>(B) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not committed within 24 months after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement;</P>
            <P>(C) Any funds from Fiscal Year 2014 and prior fiscal year allocations in the United States Treasury account that are not expended within 5 years after the last day of the month in which HUD notifies the participating jurisdiction of HUD's execution of the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement; and</P>
            <P>(D) Any penalties assessed by HUD under § 92.552.</P>
            <P>(ii) For purposes of determining the amount by which the HOME Investment Trust Fund will be reduced or recaptured under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section, HUD will consider the sum of commitments to CHDOs, commitments, or expenditures, as applicable, from all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation. This sum must be equal to or greater than the sum of all fiscal year allocations through the fiscal year allocation being examined (minus previous reductions to the HOME Investment Trust Fund), or in the case of commitments to CHDOs, 15 percent of those fiscal year allocations.</P>
            <P>(iii) HUD will reduce or recapture HOME funds in the HOME Investment Trust Fund by the amount of all fiscal year allocations through the Fiscal Year 2014 allocation that are uncommitted by the commitment deadline for the Fiscal Year 2015 allocation.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Program disbursement and information system.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The HOME Investment Trust Fund account established in the United States Treasury is managed through a computerized disbursement and information system established by HUD. The system disburses HOME funds that are allocated or reallocated, and collects and reports information on the use of HOME funds in the United States Treasury account. (For purposes of reporting in the Integrated Disbursement and Information System, a HOME project is an activity.) The participating jurisdiction must report all program income in HUD's computerized disbursement and information system.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Project set-up.</E> After the participating jurisdiction executes the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, submits the applicable banking and security documents, complies with the environmental requirements under 24 CFR part 58 for release of funds and commits funds to a specific local project, the participating jurisdiction may identify (set up) specific investments in the disbursement and information system. Investments that require the set-up of projects in the system are the acquisition, new construction, or rehabilitation of housing, and the provision of tenant-based rental assistance. The participating jurisdiction is required to enter complete project set-up information at the time of project set-up.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disbursement of HOME funds.</E> (1) After complete project set-up information is entered into the disbursement and information system, HOME funds for the project may be drawn down from the United States Treasury account by the participating jurisdiction by electronic funds transfer. The funds will be deposited in the local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund of the participating jurisdiction within 48 to 72 hours of the disbursement request. Any drawdown of HOME funds from the United States Treasury account is conditioned upon the provision of satisfactory information by the participating jurisdiction about the project or tenant-based rental assistance and compliance with other procedures, as specified by HUD.</P>
            <P>(2) HOME funds drawn from the United States Treasury account must be expended for eligible costs within 15 days. Any interest earned within the 15-day period may be retained by the participating jurisdiction as HOME funds. Any funds that are drawn down and not expended for eligible costs within 15 days of the disbursement must be returned to HUD for deposit in the participating jurisdiction's United States Treasury account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund. Interest earned after 15 days belongs to the United States and must be remitted to the United States as provided in 2 CFR 200.305(b)(9), except interest amounts up to $500 per year may be retained for administrative expenses.</P>
            <P>(3) HOME funds in the local account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund must be disbursed before requests are made for HOME funds in the United States Treasury account. Beginning with the Fiscal Year 2015 allocation, the specific funds that are committed to a project will be disbursed for that project. If both funds in the local account and funds in the United States Treasury account are committed to a project, the funds in the local account must be disbursed before requests are made for HOME funds in the United States Treasury account for the project.</P>
            <P>(4) A participating jurisdiction will be paid on an advance basis provided it complies with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Project completion.</E> (1) Complete project completion information must be entered into the disbursement and information system, or otherwise provided, within 120 days of the final project drawdown. If satisfactory project completion information is not provided, HUD may suspend further project set-ups or take other corrective actions.</P>
            <P>(2) Additional HOME funds may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion, but the amount of HOME funds in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established under § 92.250.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Access by other participants.</E> Access to the disbursement and information system by other entities participating <PRTPAGE P="604"/>in the HOME program (e.g., State recipients) will be governed by procedures established by HUD. Only participating jurisdictions and State recipients (if permitted by the State) may request disbursement.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Participating jurisdiction responsibilities; written agreements; on-site inspection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsibilities.</E> The participating jurisdiction is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of its HOME program, ensuring that HOME funds are used in accordance with all program requirements and written agreements, and taking appropriate action when performance problems arise. The use of State recipients, subrecipients, or contractors does not relieve the participating jurisdiction of this responsibility. The performance and compliance of each contractor, State recipient, and subrecipient must be reviewed at least annually. The participating jurisdiction must have and follow written policies, procedures, and systems, including a system for assessing risk of activities and projects and a system for monitoring entities consistent with this section, to ensure that the requirements of this part are met.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Executing a written agreement.</E> Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement with that entity. Before disbursing any HOME funds to any entity, a State recipient, subrecipient, or contractor which is administering all or a part of the HOME program on behalf of the participating jurisdiction, must also enter into a written agreement with that entity. The written agreement must ensure compliance with the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Provisions in written agreements.</E> The contents of the agreement may vary depending upon the role the entity is asked to assume or the type of project undertaken. This section details basic requirements by role and the minimum provisions that must be included in a written agreement.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">State recipient.</E> The provisions in the written agreement between the State and a State recipient will depend on the program functions that the State specifies the State recipient will carry out in accordance with § 92.201(b). In accordance with § 92.201, the written agreement must either require the State recipient to comply with the requirements established by the State or require the State recipient to establish its own requirements to comply with this part, including requirements for income determinations and underwriting subsidy layering guidelines, rehabilitation standards, refinancing guidelines, homebuyer program policies, and affordability.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Use of the HOME funds.</E> The agreement must describe the amount and use of the HOME funds to administer one or more programs to produce affordable housing, provide downpayment assistance, or provide tenant-based rental assistance, including the type and number of housing projects to be funded (e.g. the number of single- family homeowner loans to be made or number of homebuyers to receive downpayment assistance), tasks to be performed, a schedule for completing the tasks (including a schedule for committing funds to projects that meet the deadlines established by this part), a budget for each program, and any requirement for matching contributions. These items must be in sufficient detail to provide a sound basis for the State to effectively monitor performance under the agreement.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Affordability.</E> The agreement must require housing assisted with HOME funds to meet the affordability requirements of § 92.252 or § 92.254, as applicable, and must require repayment of the funds if the housing does not meet the affordability requirements for the specified time period.

In addition, the agreement must specify remedies for breach of the HOME requirements. The agreement must specify that, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.338, suspension or termination may occur if the State recipient materially fails to comply with any term of the agreement. The State may permit the agreement to be terminated in whole or in part in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339.</P>
            <P>(xi) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> Before the State recipient provides funds to for-profit owners or developers, nonprofit owners or developers or sponsors, subrecipients, homeowners, homebuyers, tenants (or landlords) receiving tenant-based rental assistance, or contractors who are providing services to the State recipient, the State recipient must have a written agreement with such entities that meets the requirements of this section.</P>
            <P>(xii) <E T="03">Duration of the agreement.</E> The duration of the agreement will depend on which functions the State recipient performs (e.g., whether the State recipient or the State has responsibility for monitoring rental projects for the period of affordability) and which activities are funded under the agreement.</P>

The agreement must set forth the requirements the subrecipient must follow to enable the participating jurisdiction to carry environmental review responsibilities before HOME funds are committed to a project. If HOME funds are being provided to develop rental housing or provide tenant-based rental assistance, the agreement must set forth all obligations the participating jurisdiction imposes on the subrecipient in order to meet the VAWA requirements under § 92.359, including notice obligations and obligations under the emergency transfer plan.</P>

            <P>(a) This part implements the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) program established under section 1338 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, as amended (12 U.S.C. 4501 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (the Act). In general, under the HTF program, HUD allocates funds by formula to eligible States to increase and preserve the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, with primary attention to rental housing for extremely low-income and very low-income households, including homeless families.</P>
            <P>(b) Section 1337 of the Act requires a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of total new business for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) (collectively, the government-sponsored enterprises or GSEs) to be setaside and allocated as a dedicated source of annual funding for the HTF, unless allocations are suspended by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the agency that regulates the GSEs. These funds will be deposited into an HTF account established in the Treasury of the United States by the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out the HTF program. The Act also provides that the HTF may be funded with amounts appropriated, transferred, or credited to the HTF under other provisions of law.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Eligible activities: General.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a)(1) HTF funds may be used for the production, preservation, and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing and affordable housing for first-time homebuyers through the acquisition (including assistance to homebuyers), new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of nonluxury housing with suitable amenities, including real property acquisition, site improvements, conversion, demolition, and other expenses, including financing costs, relocation expenses of any displaced persons, families, businesses, or organizations; for operating costs of HTF-assisted rental housing; and for reasonable administrative and planning costs. Not more than one third of each annual grant may be used for operating cost assistance and operating cost assistance reserves. Operating cost assistance and operating cost assistance reserves may be provided only to rental housing acquired, rehabilitated, reconstructed, or newly constructed with HTF funds. Not more than 10 percent of the annual grant shall be used for housing for homeownership. HTF-assisted housing must be permanent housing. The specific eligible costs for these activities are found in §§ 93.201 and 93.202. The activities and costs are eligible only if the housing meets the property standards in § 93.301, as applicable, upon project completion.</P>
            <P>(2) Acquisition of vacant land or demolition must be undertaken only with respect to a particular housing project intended to provide affordable housing within the time frames established in the definition of “commitment” in § 93.2.</P>
            <P>(3) HTF funds may be used to purchase and/or rehabilitate a manufactured housing unit, and purchase the land upon which a manufactured housing unit is located. The manufactured housing unit must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Forms of assistance to projects.</E> A grantee may provide HTF funds as equity investments, interest-bearing loans or advances, non-interest-bearing loans or advances, interest subsidies consistent with the purposes of this part, deferred payment loans, grants, <PRTPAGE P="630"/>or other forms of assistance that HUD determines to be consistent with the purposes of this part. Each grantee has the right to establish the terms of assistance, subject to the requirements of this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Multi-unit projects.</E> (1) HTF funds may be used to assist in the development of one or more housing units in a multi-unit project. Only the actual HTF eligible development costs of the assisted units may be charged to the HTF program. If the assisted and non-assisted units are not comparable, the actual costs may be determined based on a method of cost allocation. If the assisted and non-assisted units are comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms, the actual cost of the HTF-assisted units can be determined by prorating the total HTF-eligible development costs of the project so that the proportion of the total development costs charged to the HTF program does not exceed the proportion of the HTF-assisted units in the project.</P>
            <P>(2) After project completion, the number of units designated as HTF-assisted may be reduced only in accordance with § 93.203, except that in a project consisting of all HTF-assisted units, one unit may be converted to an onsite manager's unit if the grantee determines the conversion is reasonable and that, based on one fewer HTF-assisted unit, the costs charged to the HTF program do not exceed the actual costs of the HTF-assisted units and do not exceed the subsidy limit established pursuant to § 93.300(a).</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Terminated projects.</E> An HTF-assisted project that is terminated before completion, either voluntarily or otherwise, constitutes an ineligible activity and the grantee must repay any HTF funds invested in the project to its HTF account from which the funds were drawn (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> local or Treasury account), in accordance with § 93.403(b).

            <P>(5) For new construction or rehabilitation, the cost of funding an initial operating deficit reserve, which is a reserve to meet any shortfall in project income during the period of project rent-up (not to exceed 18 months) and which may only be used to pay project operating expenses, scheduled payments to a replacement reserve, and debt service. Any HTF funds placed in an operating deficit reserve that remain unexpended after the period of project rent-up may be retained for project reserves if permitted by the grantee.</P>
            <P>(6) Staff and overhead costs of the grantee directly related to carrying out the project, such as work specifications preparation, loan processing, and inspections. For multi-unit projects, such costs must be allocated among HTF-assisted units in a reasonable manner and documented. Although these costs may be charged as project costs, these costs cannot be charged to or paid by the assisted families.</P>
            <P>(7) For both new construction and rehabilitation, costs for the payment of impact fees that are charged for all projects within a jurisdiction.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Operating cost assistance and operating cost assistance reserves.</E> For HTF-assisted units for which project-based assistance is not available, when necessary and subject to the limitations in § 93.200(a), HTF funds may be used to pay for operating cost assistance and operating cost assistance reserves, as follows:</P>

            <P>(1) Operating costs are costs for insurance, utilities, real property taxes, and maintenance and scheduled payments to a reserve for replacement of major systems (provided that the payments must be based on the useful life of each major system and expected replacement cost) of an HTF-assisted unit. The eligible amount of HTF funds per unit for operating cost assistance is determined based on the deficit remaining after the monthly rent payment for the HTF-assisted unit is applied to the HTF-assisted unit's share of monthly operating costs. The maximum amount of the operating cost assistance to be provided to an HTF-assisted rental project must be based on the underwriting of the project and must be specified in a written agreement between the grantee and the recipient. The written agreement may commit, from a fiscal year HTF grant, funds for operating cost assistance for a multiyear period provided that the grantee is able meet its expenditure deadline in § 93.400(d). The grantee may renew operating cost assistance with future fiscal year HTF grants during the affordability period and the <PRTPAGE P="632"/>amount must be based on the need for the operating cost assistance at the time the assistance is renewed.</P>
            <P>(2) An operating cost assistance reserve may be funded by the grantee for HTF-assisted units in a project where the grantee determines in its underwriting of the project the reserve is necessary to ensure the project's financial feasibility. If the operating cost assistance reserve is funded with appropriated HTF funds, the allowable amount of the reserve shall not exceed the amount determined by the grantee to be necessary to provide operating cost assistance for HTF-assisted units, for a period not to exceed 5 years, based on an analysis of potential deficits remaining after the expected rent payments for the HTF-assisted unit are applied to the HTF-assisted unit's expected share of operating costs. The grantee may renew operating cost assistance reserves with future fiscal year HTF grants during the affordability period and the amount must be based on the need for the operating cost assistance reserve at the time the assistance for the reserve is renewed. If the operating cost assistance reserve is funded with non-appropriated HTF funds, the reserve may be funded for the period of affordability.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Relocation costs.</E> The cost of relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by the project are eligible costs.</P>

            <P>(2) Other relocation assistance means staff and overhead costs directly related to providing advisory and other relocation services to persons displaced by the project, including timely written notices to occupants, referrals to comparable and suitable replacement property, property inspections, counseling, and other assistance necessary to minimize hardship.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Costs relating to payment of loans.</E> If the HTF funds are not used to directly pay a cost specified in this section, but are used to pay off a construction loan, bridge financing loan, or guaranteed loan, the payment of principal and interest for such loan is an eligible cost only if:</P>
            <P>(1) The loan was used for eligible costs specified in this section, and</P>

            <P>(a) HTF funds may be used for new construction or rehabilitation of public housing units only in accordance with the following:</P>
            <P>(1) HTF funds may be used for new construction of public housing as part of the Choice Neighborhoods (Choice) program under a HUD appropriation act or for new public housing units that have been allocated and will receive low-income housing tax credits under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 42).</P>

            <P>(2) HTF funds may be used for the rehabilitation of existing public housing units in which the public housing assistance will be converted and used at the properties under the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program under HUD's 2012 Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 112-55, 125 Stat. 552, approved <PRTPAGE P="634"/>November 18, 2011) or subsequent statutes. HTF funds may also be used for the rehabilitation of existing public housing under the Choice program, and of existing public housing units that have been allocated and will receive low-income housing tax credits under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 42).</P>
            <P>(b) The public housing units constructed using funds under this part must replace units that were removed from a public housing agency's public housing inventory as part of a Choice program grant, or as part of a mixed-financed development under section 35 of the 1937 Act. The number of replacement units cannot be more than the number of units removed from the public housing agency's inventory. The public housing units constructed or rehabilitated using funds under this part must receive Public Housing Operating Fund assistance (and may receive Public Housing Capital Fund assistance) under section 9 of the 1937 Act. These units cannot receive operating costs assistance or operating cost assistance reserves under this part.</P>
            <P>(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, HTF-assisted housing may not receive Operating Fund or Capital Fund assistance under section 9 of the 1937 Act during the HTF period of affordability.</P>

            <P>(a) HTF funds may not be used to:</P>
            <P>(1) Provide assistance (other than assistance to a homebuyer to acquire housing previously assisted with HTF funds or renewal of operating cost assistance or renewal of operating cost assistance reserve) to a project previously assisted with HTF funds during the period of affordability established by the grantee in the written agreement under § 93.404 (c)(2)(iv). However, additional HTF funds may be committed to a project up to one year after project completion, but the amount of HTF funds in the project may not exceed the maximum per-unit development subsidy amount established pursuant to § 93.300.</P>
            <P>(2) Pay for the acquisition of property owned by the grantee, except for property acquired by the grantee with HTF funds or property acquired in anticipation of carrying out an HTF project.</P>
            <P>(3) Pay delinquent taxes, fees, or charges on properties to be assisted with HTF funds.</P>
            <P>(4) Pay for political activities, advocacy, lobbying (whether directly or through other parties), counseling services (except for housing counseling), travel expenses (other than those eligible under § 93.202(b)), or preparing or providing advice on tax returns. The prohibited use of funds for political activities includes influencing the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of one or more candidates to any Federal, State, or local office as codified in section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501).</P>

            <P>(b)(1) The grantee may not charge (and must prohibit subgrantees and recipients from charging) servicing, origination, or other fees for the costs of administering the HTF program. However, the grantee may charge owners of rental projects reasonable annual fees for monitoring compliance during the period of affordability. The fees must be based upon the average actual cost of performing the monitoring of HTF-assisted rental projects. The basis for determining the amount of the fee must be documented and the fee must be included in the costs of the project as part of the project underwriting.</P>

            <P>(2) The grantee may also charge nominal application fees (although these fees are not an eligible HTF cost) to eligible recipients, to discourage frivolous applications. The amount of application fees must be appropriate to the type of application and may not <PRTPAGE P="635"/>create an undue impediment to an extremely low-income family to be able to participate in the grantee's program.</P>
            <P>(3) All fees are applicable credits under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.</P>

            <P>(4) In addition, the grantee must prohibit project owners from charging fees that are not customarily charged in rental housing (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> laundry room access fees), except that rental project owners may charge:</P>

These standards preempt State and local codes which are not identical to the Federal standards for the new construction of manufactured housing. The grantees providing HTF funds to assist manufactured housing units must comply with applicable State and local laws or codes. In the absence of such laws or codes, the installation must comply with the manufacturer's written instructions for installation of manufactured housing units. All new manufactured housing and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of “reconstruction” must be on a permanent foundation that meets the requirements for foundation systems as set forth in 24 CFR 203.43f(c)(i). All new manufactured housing (and all manufactured housing that replaces an existing substandard unit under the definition of “reconstruction”) must, at the time of project completion, be connected to permanent utility hook-ups and be located on land that is owned by the manufactured housing unit owner or land for which the manufactured housing owner has a lease for a period at least equal to the applicable period of affordability. In HTF-funded rehabilitation of existing manufactured housing the foundation and anchoring must meet all applicable State and local codes, ordinances, and requirements or in the absence of local or State codes, the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards at 24 CFR part 3285.

            <P>(A) Construction and other activities in the 100-year floodplain are to be avoided when practicable. If there are <PRTPAGE P="640"/>no practicable alternatives to new construction or substantial improvement in the 100-year floodplain, the structure must be elevated at least the base flood elevation (BFE) or floodproofed to one foot above the BFE. Elevated and floodproofed buildings must adhere to National Flood Insurance Program standards. The primary sources of floodplain data are Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). When FEMA provides interim flood hazard data, such as Advisory Base Flood Elevations (ABFE) or preliminary maps or studies, the latest of these sources shall be used.</P>
            <P>(B) No HTF assistance may be approved with respect to:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Any action, other than a functionally dependent use, located in a floodway;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Any new construction critical action located in a coastal high hazard area, 100- or 500-year floodplain; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any non-critical new construction action in a coastal high hazard area, unless the action is reconstruction following destruction caused by a disaster and is designed for location in a coastal high hazard area consistent with the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program requirements for V-Zones.</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> (A) No draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, or related grading activities are to be performed in wetlands. No activities, structures, or facilities funded under this program are to adversely impact a wetland.</P>

            <P>(B) A wetland means those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances, does or would support a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, potholes, wet meadows, river overflows, mud flats, and natural ponds. This definition includes those wetland areas separated from their natural supply of water as a result of activities, such as the construction of structural flood protection methods or solid-fill road beds, or mineral extraction and navigation improvements. This definition is independent of the definition of jurisdictional wetland used by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Explosives and hazards.</E> Projects must be in compliance with the standards for acceptable separation distance, as set forth at 24 CFR part 51, subpart C.</P>
            <P>(ix) <E T="03">Contamination.</E> All properties assisted with HTF funds must be free of hazardous materials, contamination, toxic chemicals and gases, and radioactive substances, where a hazard could affect the health and safety of occupants or conflict with the intended use of the property.</P>
            <P>(A) All proposed multifamily (more than four housing units) HTF projects require a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA-ASTM). If the Phase I ESA identifies recognized environmental concerns (RECs), a Phase II (ESA-ASTM) will be required. ASTM reports shall be prepared in accordance with the most current ASTM standard. Single family housing does not require a Phase I ESA.</P>
            <P>(B) HTF projects must avoid sites located within 0.25 miles of a Superfund or CERCLIS (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System) site or other contaminated site reported to Federal, State, or local authorities without a statement in writing from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the appropriate State agency that there is no hazard that could affect the health and safety of the occupants or conflict with the intended use of the property.</P>
            <P>(x) <E T="03">Noise.</E> (A) Internal noise levels: All activities will be developed to ensure an interior noise level of no more than 45 decibels (dB).</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Project sites exposed to less than or equal to 65 dB of environmental noise are acceptable.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Sites between 65 dB and less than 75 dB are acceptable with mitigation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> noise walls, careful site planning) that result in an interior standard of 45 dB.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Locations with environmental noise levels of 75 dB or greater may not <PRTPAGE P="641"/>have noise sensitive outdoor uses (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> picnic areas, tot lots, balconies, or patios) and <E T="03">require</E> sound attenuation in the building shell to achieve the 45 dB interior standard.</P>
            <P>(xi) <E T="03">Endangered species.</E> The grantee must avoid all actions which could jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species, as designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service, or would result in the destruction or adversely modify the designated critical habitat of such species.</P>
            <P>(xii) <E T="03">Wild and scenic rivers.</E> The grantee must avoid activities that are inconsistent with conservation easements, land-use protections, and restrictions adjacent to wild and scenic rivers, as designated/listed by the Departments of Agriculture or Interior. Maps for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System are available at the governing departments.</P>
            <P>(xiii) <E T="03">Safe drinking water.</E> Projects with a potable water system must use only lead-free pipes, solder, and flux.</P>
            <P>(xiv) <E T="03">Sole-source aquifers.</E> Project activities should avoid sites and activities that have the potential to contaminate sole source aquifer areas (SSAs). EPA defines a sole or principal source aquifer as an aquifer that supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water consumed in the area overlying the aquifer. If the project overlies an SSA, EPA must review the project. EPA review is designed to reduce the risk of ground water contamination that could pose a health hazard to those who use it.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Rehabilitation projects environmental requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Historic preservation.</E> (A) The project activities (including demolition) must not be performed on properties that are either listed in or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, unless the project activities meet the <E T="03">Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation,</E> either as certified through the Federal and/or State historic rehabilitation tax credit programs or as verified by someone that meets the relevant <E T="03">Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards;</E>
            </P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Archaeological resources.</E> If archaeological resources or human remains are discovered on the project site during construction or rehabilitation, the grantee must consult with affected tribes and/or descendant communities and comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001-3013), State law, and/or local ordinance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> State unmarked burial law).</P>

            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Any non-critical action located in a coastal high hazard area, unless the action is designed for location in a coastal high hazard area consistent with the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program requirements for V-Zones. “Any non-critical action in a coastal high hazard area, unless the action is reconstruction following destruction caused by a disaster and is designed for location in a coastal high hazard area consistent with the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program requirements for V-Zones.”</P>
            <P>(vii) <E T="03">Wetlands.</E> No rehabilitation of existing properties that expands the footprint into a wetland is allowed. A wetland means those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances, does or would support a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, potholes, wet meadows, river overflows, mud flats, and natural ponds.

            <P>(viii) <E T="03">Explosives and hazards.</E> If the rehabilitation of the building increases the number of dwelling units, then the project must be in compliance with the standards for acceptable separation distance as set forth at 24 CFR part 51, subpart C.</P>
            <P>(ix) <E T="03">Contamination.</E> All properties assisted with HTF funds must be free of hazardous materials, contamination, toxic chemicals and gases, and radioactive substances, where a hazard could affect the health and safety of occupants or conflict with the intended use of the property:</P>
            <P>(A) All proposed multifamily (more than four housing units) HTF project activities require a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA—ASTM).

            <P>(xiii) <E T="03">Safe drinking water.</E> Projects with a potable water system must use only lead-free pipes, solder, and flux.<PRTPAGE P="643"/>
            </P>
            <P>(xiv) <E T="03">Sole-source aquifers.</E> Project activities should avoid sites and activities that have the potential to contaminate sole source aquifer areas (SSAs). The EPA defines a sole or principal source aquifer as an aquifer that supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water consumed in the area overlying the aquifer.

            <SUBJECT>Qualification as affordable housing: rental housing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible tenants.</E> The HTF-assisted units in a rental housing project must be occupied by households who are eligible families in accordance with the income targeting requirements in § 93.250.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Rent limitations</E>—(1)(i) <E T="03">Extremely low-income tenants.</E> The HTF rent plus utilities of an extremely low-income tenant shall not exceed the greater of 30 percent of the federal poverty line or 30 percent of the income of a family whose annual income equals 30 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for the number of bedrooms in the unit. HUD will publish the HTF rent limits on an annual basis.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Very-low income tenants.</E> The HTF rent plus utilities of a very low-income tenant shall not exceed 30 percent of the income of a family whose annual income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for the number of bedrooms in the unit. HUD will publish the HTF rent limits on an annual basis.</P>
            <P>(2) If the unit receives Federal or State project-based rental subsidy, and the tenant pays as a contribution toward rent not more than 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income, the maximum rent is the rent allowable under the Federal or State project-based rental subsidy program.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial rent schedule and utility allowance.</E> (1) The grantee must establish maximum monthly allowances for utilities and services (excluding telephone, television, and Internet service).</P>
            <P>(2) The grantee must annually review and approve rents proposed by the owner for HTF units. For all units for which the tenant is paying utilities, the grantee must ensure that the rents do not exceed the maximum rent minus the monthly allowances for utilities.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Periods of affordability.</E> (1) HTF-assisted units must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 30 years, beginning after project completion. The grantee may impose longer periods.</P>

            <P>(2) The affordability requirements apply without regard to the term of any loan or mortgage, repayment of the HTF investment, or the transfer of ownership. They must be imposed by a deed restriction, covenant running with the land, an agreement restricting the use of the property, or other mechanisms approved by HUD under which the grantee and beneficiaries have the right to require specific performance, <PRTPAGE P="644"/>except that the affordability restrictions may terminate upon foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure. The affordability requirements must be recorded in accordance with State recordation laws.</P>
            <P>(3) The grantee may use purchase options, rights of first refusal, or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure to preserve affordability.</P>
            <P>(4) The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family or business ties, obtains an ownership interest in the project or property.</P>
            <P>(5) The termination of the restrictions on the project does not terminate the grantee's repayment obligation under § 93.403.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Tenant income.</E> (1) The income of each tenant must be determined initially in accordance with § 93.151. In addition, in each year during the period of affordability, the project owner must re-examine each tenant's annual income in accordance with one of the options in § 93.151(c) selected by the grantee.</P>
            <P>(2) An owner who re-examines a tenant's annual income through a statement and certification in accordance with § 93.151(a)(1)(iii) must examine the source documentation of the income of each tenant every 6th year of the affordability period, except that, for units that receive project-based assistance, the owner must re-examine the tenant's annual income in accordance with the project-based assistance rules. Otherwise, an owner who accepts the tenant's statement and certification in accordance with § 93.151(a)(1)(iii) is not required to examine the income of tenants, unless there is evidence that the tenant's written statement failed to completely and accurately state information about the family's size or income.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Over-income tenants.</E> HTF-assisted units continue to qualify as affordable housing despite a temporary noncompliance caused by increases in the incomes of existing tenants if actions satisfactory to HUD are being taken to ensure that all vacancies are filled in accordance with this section until the noncompliance is corrected.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Fixed and floating HTF units.</E> In a project containing HTF-assisted and other units, the grantee may designate fixed or floating HTF units. This designation must be made at the time of project commitment in the written agreement between the grantee and the recipient, and the HTF units must be identified not later than the time of project completion. Fixed units must remain the same throughout the period of affordability. Floating units must be changed to maintain conformity with the requirements of this section during the period of affordability so that the total number of housing units meeting the requirements of this section remains the same, and each substituted unit must be comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the originally designated HTF-assisted unit.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> The tenants must be selected in accordance with § 93.303.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Onsite inspections and financial oversight.</E> See § 93.404(d) for the grantee's ongoing responsibilities for onsite inspections and financial oversight.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Tenant protections and selection.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Lease.</E> There must be a written lease between the tenant and the owner of rental housing assisted with HTF funds that is for a period of not less than one year, unless by mutual agreement between the tenant and the owner a shorter period is specified. The lease must incorporate the VAWA lease term/addendum required under § 93.356(d).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibited lease terms.</E> The lease may not contain any of the following provisions:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Agreement to be sued.</E> Agreement by the tenant to be sued, to admit guilt, or to a judgment in favor of the owner in a lawsuit brought in connection with the lease;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Treatment of property.</E> Agreement by the tenant that the owner may take, hold, or sell personal property of household members without notice to the tenant and a court decision on the <PRTPAGE P="645"/>rights of the parties. This prohibition, however, does not apply to an agreement by the tenant concerning disposition of personal property remaining in the housing unit after the tenant has moved out of the unit. The owner may dispose of this personal property in accordance with State law;</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Excusing owner from responsibility.</E> Agreement by the tenant not to hold the owner or the owner's agents legally responsible for any action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent;</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Waiver of notice.</E> Agreement of the tenant that the owner may institute a lawsuit without notice to the tenant;</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Waiver of legal proceedings.</E> Agreement by the tenant that the owner may evict the tenant or household members without instituting a civil court proceeding in which the tenant has the opportunity to present a defense, or before a court decision on the rights of the parties;</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Waiver of a jury trial.</E> Agreement by the tenant to waive any right to a trial by jury;</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Waiver of right to appeal court decision.</E> Agreement by the tenant to waive the tenant's right to appeal, or to otherwise challenge in court, a court decision in connection with the lease;</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Tenant chargeable with cost of legal actions regardless of outcome.</E> Agreement by the tenant to pay attorney's fees or other legal costs even if the tenant wins in a court proceeding by the owner against the tenant. The tenant, however, may be obligated to pay costs if the tenant loses; and</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Mandatory supportive services.</E> Agreement by the tenant to accept supportive services that are offered.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of tenancy.</E> An owner may not terminate the tenancy or refuse to renew the lease of a tenant of rental housing assisted with HTF funds, except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease; for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law; or for other good cause. Good cause does not include an increase in the tenant's income. To terminate or refuse to renew tenancy, the owner must serve written notice upon the tenant specifying the grounds for the action and providing a specific period for vacating that is consistent with State or local law.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> An owner of rental housing assisted with HTF funds must comply with the affirmative marketing requirements established by the grantee pursuant to § 93.350. The owner must adopt and follow written tenant selection policies and criteria that:</P>
            <P>(1) Limit the housing to income-eligible families;</P>

            <P>(2) Are reasonably related to the applicants' ability to perform the obligations of the lease (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> to pay the rent, not to damage the housing; not to interfere with the rights and quiet enjoyment of other tenants);</P>
            <P>(3) Limit eligibility or give a preference to a particular segment of the population if permitted in its written agreement with the grantee (and only if the limitation or preference is described in the grantee's consolidated plan).</P>

            <P>(i) Any limitation or preference must not violate nondiscrimination requirements in § 93.350. A limitation or preference does not violate nondiscrimination requirements if the housing also receives funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the Housing Opportunity for Persons With AIDS program under 24 CFR part 574), and the limit or preference is tailored to serve that segment of the population.</P>
            <P>(ii) If a project does not receive funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population, the project may have a limitation or preference for persons with disabilities who need services offered at a project only if:</P>
            <P>(A) The limitation or preference is limited to the population of families (including individuals) with disabilities that significantly interfere with their ability to obtain and maintain housing;</P>
            <P>(B) Such families will not be able to obtain or maintain themselves in housing without appropriate supportive services; and</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Single family housing.</E> The housing must be single-family housing, as defined at § 93.2.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Modest housing.</E> The housing must be modest housing, in accordance with § 93.305.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">First-time homebuyer and income requirements.</E> The housing must be acquired by a first-time homebuyer whose family qualifies as an income-eligible family in accordance with § 93.251 and the housing must be the principal residence of the family throughout the period described in paragraph (e) of this section. In determining the income eligibility of the family, the grantee must include the income of all persons living in the housing. Before purchasing the housing, the family must have completed a program of independent financial education and homeownership counseling from an eligible organization that has been certified in accordance with section 106(e) of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701x (e)).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of affordability.</E> The HTF-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 30 years.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Resale or recapture requirements.</E> The grantee must establish the resale or recapture requirements that comply with the standards of § 93.305 and set forth the requirements in its consolidated plan. HUD must determine that they are appropriate and must specifically approve them in writing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Special considerations for single family properties with more than one unit.</E> (1) If the HTF funds are used only to assist an income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one unit in a single family property containing more than one unit and the assisted unit will be the principal residence of the homebuyer, the affordability requirements of this section apply only to the assisted unit.</P>
            <P>(2) If HTF funds are also used to assist the income-eligible homebuyer in acquiring one or more of the rental units in the single family property, the affordability requirements of § 93.302 apply to assisted rental units, except that the grantee must impose resale restrictions on all assisted units (owner-occupied and rental units) in the single-family housing. The affordability requirements on all assisted units continue for the period of affordability. If HTF funds are used to assist only the rental units in such a property, then the requirements of § 93.302 would apply and the owner-occupied unit would not be subject to the income targeting or affordability provisions of this section.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Lease-purchase.</E> (1) HTF funds may be used to assist homebuyers through lease-purchase programs for existing housing and for housing to be constructed. The housing must be purchased by an eligible homebuyer within 36 months of signing the lease-purchase agreement. The homebuyer must qualify as an income-eligible family at the time the lease-purchase agreement is signed.</P>
            <P>(2) If HTF funds are used to acquire housing that will be resold to a homebuyer through a lease-purchase program, the HTF affordability requirements for rental housing in § 93.302 shall apply if the housing is not transferred to an eligible homebuyer within 42 months after project completion.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Contract to purchase.</E> If HTF funds are used to assist a homebuyer who has <PRTPAGE P="647"/>entered into a contract to purchase housing to be constructed, the homebuyer must qualify as an income-eligible family at the time the contract is signed.</P>
            <P>(j) If there is no ratified sales contract with an eligible homebuyer for the housing within 9 months of the date of completion of construction or rehabilitation, the housing must be rented to an eligible tenant in accordance with § 93.301.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Preserving affordability.</E> (1) To preserve the affordability of housing that was previously assisted with HTF funds and subject to the requirements of this section, a grantee may use additional HTF funds to acquire the housing through a purchase option, right of first refusal, or other preemptive right before foreclosure, or to acquire the housing at the foreclosure sale, undertake any necessary rehabilitation, and provide assistance to another first-time homebuyer. The housing must be sold to a new eligible homebuyer in accordance with the requirements of this section. Additional HTF funds may not be used if the mortgage in default was funded with HTF funds.</P>
            <P>(2) The total amount of original and additional HTF assistance may not exceed the maximum per-unit development subsidy amount established pursuant to § 93.300. As an alternative to charging the cost to the HTF program under § 93.201, the grantee may charge the cost to the HTF program under § 93.302 as a reasonable administrative cost of its HTF program, so that the additional HTF funds for the housing are not subject to the maximum per-unit subsidy amount.</P>
            <P>(l) <E T="03">Agreements with lending institutions.</E> (1) The grantee may provide homeownership assistance through written agreements with for-profit or nonprofit lending institutions that are providing the first mortgage loan to a family. The grantee must independently verify that the family is income-eligible and meets the definition of “first-time homebuyer,” and must inspect the housing for compliance with the applicable property standards.</P>

            <P>(2) No fees may be charged to the family for the HTF homeownership assistance (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> origination fees or points, processing fees, inspection fees). The grantee must determine that the fees and other amounts charged to the family by the lender for the first mortgage financing are reasonable. Reasonable administrative costs of the HTF homeownership assistance can be charged to the HTF program as a project cost. If the grantee requires lenders to pay a fee to participate in the HTF program, the fee is program income to the HTF program.</P>
            <P>(m) <E T="03">Written policies.</E> The grantee must have and follow written policies for:</P>
            <P>(1) Underwriting standards for homeownership assistance that examine the family's housing debt, overall debt, income, and ability to maintain the housing;</P>
            <P>(2) Anti-predatory lending; and</P>
            <P>(3) Refinancing loans to which HTF loans are subordinated to ensure that the terms of the new loan are reasonable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Qualification as affordable housing: modest housing requirements for homeownership; resale or recapture requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Housing that is for acquisition by a family pursuant to § 93.304 must be modest housing.</P>

            <P>(1) The housing must be modest housing as follows: The housing has a purchase price for the type of single family housing that does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area for newly constructed or standard housing. The grantee must use the HTF affordable homeownership limits provided by HUD for newly constructed housing and for existing housing. HUD will provide limits for affordable newly constructed housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using Federal Housing Administration (FHA) single family mortgage program data for newly constructed housing, with a minimum limit based on 95 percent of the U.S. median purchase price for new construction for nonmetropolitan areas. HUD will provide limits for affordable existing housing based on 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area using FHA single family mortgage program data for existing housing data and other appropriate data that are available nation-wide for sales of existing housing, with a minimum limit <PRTPAGE P="648"/>based on 95 percent of the state-wide nonmetropolitan area median purchase price using these data. For States with no non-metropolitan areas, the minimum purchase price is defined as the lesser of the State non-metro or the United States non-metro median.</P>
            <P>(2) In lieu of the limits provided by HUD, the grantee may determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price for single family housing in the jurisdiction annually, as follows: The grantee must set forth the price for different types of single family housing for the jurisdiction. The grantee may determine separate limits for existing housing and newly constructed housing. For housing located outside of metropolitan areas, a grantee may aggregate sales data from more than one county, if the counties are contiguous and similarly situated. The following information must be included in the annual action plan of the consolidated plan submitted to HUD for review and updated in each action plan:</P>
            <P>(i) The 95 percent of median area purchase price must be established in accordance with a market analysis that ensured that a sufficient number of recent housing sales are included in the survey.</P>
            <P>(ii) Sales must cover the requisite number of months based on volume: For 500 or more sales per month, a one- month reporting period; for 250 through 499 sales per month, a 2-month reporting period; for less than 250 sales per month, at least a 3-month reporting period. The data must be listed in ascending order of sales price.</P>
            <P>(iii) The address of the listed properties must include the location within the grantee. Lot, square, and subdivision data may be substituted for the street address.</P>
            <P>(iv) The housing sales data must reflect all, or nearly all, of the one- family house sales in the entire area.</P>
            <P>(v) To determine the median, take the middle sale on the list if an odd number of sales, and if an even number, take the higher of the middle numbers and consider it the median. After identifying the median sales price, the amount should be multiplied by 0.95 to determine 95 percent of the median area purchase price.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Resale or recapture requirements.</E> The grantee must establish the resale or recapture requirements that comply with the standards of this section and set forth the requirements in its consolidated plan. The HTF-assisted housing must meet the affordability requirements for not less than 30 years if resale restrictions are used. If recapture restrictions are used, the affordability periods are based on the amount of HTF funds per unit as follows:</P>

            </GPOTABLE>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Resale.</E> Resale requirements must ensure, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability, that the housing is made available for subsequent purchase only to a buyer whose family qualifies as a very low-income family and will use the property as the family's principal residence. The resale requirement must also ensure that the price at resale provides the original HTF-assisted owner a fair return on investment (including the homeowner's investment and any capital improvement) and ensure that the housing will remain affordable to a reasonable range of income-eligible homebuyers. The grantee must specifically define “fair return on investment” and “affordability to a reasonable range of very low-income homebuyers,” and specifically address how it will make the housing affordable to an income eligible homebuyer in the event that the resale price necessary to provide fair return is not affordable to the subsequent buyer. Deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other mechanisms approved by HUD must be used as the mechanism to impose the resale requirements. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA insured mortgage to HUD. The grantee may use purchase options, <PRTPAGE P="649"/>rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the housing.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Recapture.</E> (i) Recapture provisions must ensure that the grantee recoups all or a portion of the HTF assistance to the homebuyers, if the housing does not continue to be the principal residence of the family for the duration of the period of affordability. The grantee may structure its recapture provisions based on its program design and market conditions. Recapture provisions may permit the subsequent homebuyer to assume the HTF assistance (subject to the HTF requirements for the remainder of the period of affordability) if the subsequent homebuyer is income-eligible, and no additional HTF assistance is provided.</P>
            <P>(ii) The following options for recapture requirements are acceptable to HUD. The grantee may adopt, modify, or develop its own recapture requirements for HUD approval. In establishing its recapture requirements, the grantee is subject to the limitation that, when the recapture requirement is triggered by a sale (voluntary or involuntary) of the housing unit, the amount recaptured cannot exceed the net proceeds, if any. The net proceeds are the sales price minus superior loan repayment (other than HTF funds) and any closing costs.</P>
            <P>(A) <E T="03">Recapture entire amount.</E> The grantee may recapture the entire amount of the HTF assistance from the homeowner.</P>
            <P>(B) <E T="03">Reduction during affordability period.</E> The grantee may reduce the HTF assistance amount to be recaptured on a prorata basis for the time the homeowner has owned and occupied the housing measured against the required affordability period.</P>
            <P>(C) <E T="03">Shared net proceeds.</E> If the net proceeds are not sufficient to recapture the full HTF assistance (or a reduced amount as provided for in this section) plus enable the homeowner to recover the amount of the homeowner's downpayment and any capital improvement investment made by the owner since purchase, the grantee may share the net proceeds. The net proceeds are the sales price minus loan repayment (other than HTF funds) and closing costs. The net proceeds may be divided proportionally as set forth in the following mathematical formulas:</P>

            </GPH>
            <P>(D) <E T="03">Owner investment returned first.</E> The grantee may permit the homebuyer to recover the homebuyer's entire investment (downpayment and capital improvements made by the owner since purchase) before recapturing the HTF assistance.</P>
            <P>(E) <E T="03">Amount subject to recapture.</E> The HTF assistance that is subject to recapture is based on the amount of HTF assistance that enabled the homebuyer to buy the dwelling unit. This includes any HTF assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price, but excludes the amount between the cost of producing the unit and the market value of the property (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the development subsidy). The recaptured funds must be used to carry out HTF-eligible activities in accordance with the requirements of this part. If the HTF assistance is only used for the development subsidy and therefore not subject to recapture, the resale option must be used.</P>

The requirements of this subpart include: nondiscrimination and equal opportunity; disclosure requirements; debarred, suspended, or ineligible contractors; drug-free work; and housing counseling.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Affirmative marketing.</E> (1) Each grantee must adopt and follow affirmative marketing procedures and requirements for rental projects containing five or more HTF-assisted housing units and for homeownership assistance programs. Affirmative marketing steps consist of actions to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons in the housing market area to the available housing without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, religion, familial status, or disability. If a grantee's written agreement with the project owner permits the rental housing project to limit tenant eligibility or to have a tenant preference in accordance with § 93.303(d)(3), the grantee must have affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that apply in the context of the limited/preferred tenant eligibility for the project.</P>
            <P>(2) The affirmative marketing requirements and procedures adopted must include:</P>

            <P>(i) Methods for informing the public, owners, and potential tenants about Federal fair housing laws and the grantee's affirmative marketing policy (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan in press releases and solicitations for owners, and written communication to fair housing and other groups);</P>

            <P>(ii) Requirements and practices the grantee and owner must adhere to in order to carry out the grantee's affirmative marketing procedures and requirements (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> use of commercial media, use of community contacts, use of the Equal Housing Opportunity logotype or slogan, and display of fair housing poster);</P>

            <P>(iii) Procedures to be used by the grantee and owners to inform and solicit applications from persons in the housing market area who are not likely to apply for the rental housing or homeownership assistance program without special outreach (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> through the use of community organizations, places of worship, employment centers, fair housing groups, or housing counseling agencies);</P>
            <P>(iv) Records that will be kept describing actions taken by the grantee and owners to affirmatively market rental housing units and homeownership assistance program and records to assess the results of these actions; and</P>
            <P>(v) A description of how the grantee will annually assess the success of affirmative marketing actions and what corrective actions will be taken where affirmative marketing requirements are not met.</P>
            <P>(3) A grantee that subgrants HTF funds to subgrantees must require each subgrantee to either follow the grantee's procedures and requirements or adopt its own affirmative marketing procedures and requirements that meet this section.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, the grantee must ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted with HTF funds. To the extent feasible, displaced residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex upon completion of the project.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate <PRTPAGE P="651"/>temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</P>
            <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs.</P>
            <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
            <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
            <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
            <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex upon completion of the project; and</P>
            <P>(iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655) and 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, the minority person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Displaced person.</E> (i) For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term “displaced person” means a person (family individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm, including any corporation, partnership or association) that moves from real property or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted with HTF funds. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
            <P>(A) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The date of the submission of an application to the grantee or HUD, if the applicant has site control and the application is later approved; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The date the grantee approves the applicable site, if the applicant does not have site control at the time of the application; or</P>
            <P>(B) Before the date described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, if the grantee or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project; or</P>
            <P>(C) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant moves after execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering the tenant the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a term of at least one year at a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The tenant's monthly rent before such agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.628, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income;</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-<PRTPAGE P="652"/>pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
            <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” if:</P>
            <P>(A) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and the grantee determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance. The effective date of any termination or refusal to renew must be preceded by at least 30 calendar days advance written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for the action.</P>

            <P>(B) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application, but before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, incur a rent increase), and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for any assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
            <P>(C) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>

            <P>(iii) The grantee may, at any time, ask HUD to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this rule.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing replacement housing assistance to be provided under this paragraph (c) to a tenant displaced from a dwelling as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional relocation assistance.</E> The grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms displaced by a project assisted with HTF funds where the displacement is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide relocation assistance to persons covered under paragraph (c) of this section beyond that required. For any such assistance that is not required by State or local law, the grantee must adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the optional relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements of 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability of 2 CFR 200.318.</E> In the procurement of property and services by grantees and subgrantees, the conflict of interest provisions in 2 CFR 200.318 apply. In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.318, the provisions of this section apply.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflicts prohibited.</E> No persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted with HTF funds or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to these activities may obtain a financial interest or financial benefit from a HTF-assisted activity, or have a financial interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect to the HTF-assisted activity, or the proceeds from such activity, either for themselves or those with whom they have business or immediate family ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter. Immediate family ties include (whether by blood, marriage, or adoption) the spouse, parent (including <PRTPAGE P="653"/>a stepparent), child (including a stepchild), brother, sister (including a stepbrother or stepsister), grandparent, grandchild, and in-laws of a covered person.</P>

            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions: Threshold requirements.</E> Upon the written request of the grantee, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HTF and the effective and efficient administration of the grantee's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the grantee has provided the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>
            <P>(2) An opinion of the grantee's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate State or local law.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions.</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the grantee has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, HUD will consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of income eligible persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (c) of this section;</P>
            <P>(5) Whether undue hardship will result either to the grantee or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</P>

            <P>(f) <E T="03">Recipient</E>—(1) <E T="03">General</E>. No recipient assisted with HTF funds (or officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of recipient or immediate family member or immediate family member of an officer, employee, agent, elected or appointed official, or consultant of a recipient) whether private, for-profit or nonprofit, may occupy a HTF-assisted affordable housing unit in a project during the required period of affordability specified in § 93.302(e) or § 93.304. This provision does not apply to an employee or agent of the recipient who occupies a housing unit as the project manager or maintenance worker.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Exceptions.</E> Upon written request of a recipient, the grantee (or subgrantee, if authorized by the grantee) may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section on a case-by-case basis when it determines that the exception will serve to further the purposes of the HTF program and the effective and efficient administration of the recipient's HTF-assisted project. In determining whether to grant a requested exception, the grantee shall consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the person receiving the benefit is a member of a group or class of low-income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted housing, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted housing in question;</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Notification requirements.</E> The grantee must provide a notice and certification form that meet the requirements of 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the owner of HTF-assisted rental housing. The owner of HTF-assisted rental housing must provide the notice and certification form described in 24 CFR 5.2005(a) to the applicant for a HTF-assisted unit at the time the applicant is admitted to an HTF-assisted unit, or denied admission to a HTF-assisted unit based on the owner's tenant selection policies and criteria.

The list must include the following information for each property: The property's address, contact information, the unit sizes (number of bedrooms) for the HTF-assisted units, and, to the extent known, any tenant preferences or eligibility restrictions for the HTF-assisted units. In addition, the grantee may:</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Project set-up.</E> (1) After the grantee executes the HTF grant agreement, submits the applicable banking and security documents, and commits funds to a specific local project, the grantee shall identify (set up) specific activities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> projects) in the disbursement and information system. Investments that require the set-up of projects in the system are the acquisition, new construction, or rehabilitation of housing, operating cost assistance, and operating cost assistance reserves. The grantee is required to enter complete project set-up information at the time of project set-up.</P>
            <P>(2) If the project set-up information is not completed within 20 calendar days of the date of the initial project set-up, the project may be canceled by the system. In addition, a project that has been committed in the system for 12 months without an initial disbursement of funds may be canceled by the system.</P>

In addition, the agreement must specify remedies for breach of the provisions of the agreement.</P>
            <P>(xi) <E T="03">Duration of the agreement.</E> The agreement must specify the duration of the agreement.

The inspections must be in accordance with the inspection procedures that the grantee establishes to meet the inspection requirements of § 93.301.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Period of affordability.</E> (i) During the period of affordability, the grantee must perform onsite inspections of HTF-assisted rental housing buildings to determine compliance with the ongoing property standards of § 93.301 and to verify the information submitted by the owners in accordance with the requirements of § 93.302.

            <P>(ii) The onsite inspections must occur 12 months after project completion and at least once every 3 years thereafter during the period of affordability.</P>
            <P>(iii) If there are observed deficiencies for any of the inspectable items established by the grantee, in accordance with the inspection requirements of § 93.301, a follow-up onsite inspection must occur within 12 months, or within a reasonable time frame established by the grantee depending on the severity of the deficiency, to verify that all observed deficiencies have been corrected. The grantee may establish a list of non-hazardous deficiencies for which correction can be verified by third party documentation rather than reinspection. The grantee must adopt a more frequent inspection schedule for properties that have been found to have health and safety violations. Life-threatening health and safety deficiencies must be corrected immediately, in accordance with § 93.301.</P>
            <P>(iv) The property owner must annually certify to the grantee that each building in the project is suitable for occupancy, taking into account State and local health, safety, and other applicable codes, ordinances, and requirements, and the ongoing property standards established by the grantee to meet the requirements of § 93.301.</P>
            <P>(v) Inspections must be based on a statistically valid sample of units appropriate for the size of the HTF-assisted project, as set forth by HUD through notice. The grantee must select the sample. For projects with one to four HTF-assisted units, the inspectable items (site, building exterior, building systems, and common areas) for each building with HTF-assisted units and 100 percent of the HTF-assisted dwelling units must be inspected.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Financial oversight.</E> During the period of affordability, the grantee must examine regularly (at least annually) the financial condition of HTF-assisted rental projects with 10 or more HTF-assisted units to determine the continued financial viability of the housing and must take actions to correct problems.</P>

            <P>(1) HUD shall reduce the funds in the grantee's HTF account by the amount of any expenditures that were not in accordance with the requirements of this part or require the grantee to repay to HUD any amount of the HTF grant that was not used in accordance with the requirements of this part; and</P>
            <P>(2) HUD may do one or more of the following:</P>

                <P>This regulation is issued under the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to administer and enforce title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (the Fair Housing Act).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) It is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the United States. No person shall be subjected to discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin in the sale, rental, or advertising of dwellings, in the provision of brokerage services, or in the availability of residential real estate-related transactions.</P>
                <P>(b) This part provides the Department's interpretation of the coverage of the Fair Housing Act regarding discrimination related to the sale or rental of dwellings, the provision of services in connection therewith, and the availability of residential real estate-related transactions. The illustrations of unlawful housing discrimination in this part may be established by a practice's discriminatory effect, even if not motivated by discriminatory intent, consistent with the standards outlined in § 100.500.</P>
                <P>(c) Nothing in this part relieves persons participating in a Federal or Federally-assisted program or activity from other requirements applicable to buildings and dwellings.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Liability for discriminatory housing practices.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Direct liability.</E> (1) A person is directly liable for:</P>
                <P>(i) The person's own conduct that results in a discriminatory housing practice.</P>
                <P>(ii) Failing to take prompt action to correct and end a discriminatory housing practice by that person's employee or agent, where the person knew or should have known of the discriminatory conduct.</P>
                <P>(iii) Failing to take prompt action to correct and end a discriminatory housing practice by a third-party, where the person knew or should have known of the discriminatory conduct and had the power to correct it. The power to take prompt action to correct and end a discriminatory housing practice by a third-party depends upon the extent of the person's control or any other legal responsibility the person may have with respect to the conduct of such third-party.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of determining liability under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, prompt action to correct and end the discriminatory housing practice may not include any action that penalizes or harms the aggrieved person, such as eviction of the aggrieved person.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Vicarious liability.</E> A person is vicariously liable for a discriminatory housing practice by the person's agent or employee, regardless of whether the person knew or should have known of the conduct that resulted in a discriminatory housing practice, consistent with agency law.</P>

                <P>(2) Prohibit a private club, not in fact open to the public, which, incident to its primary purpose or purposes, provides lodgings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodgings to its members or from giving preference to its members;</P>
                <P>(3) Limit the applicability of any reasonable local, State or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling; or</P>

                <P>(4) Prohibit conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802).<PRTPAGE P="673"/>

                <P>(i) The owner does not own or have any interest in more than three single family houses at any one time.</P>
                <P>(ii) The house is sold or rented without the use of a real estate broker, agent or salesperson or the facilities of any person in the business of selling or renting dwellings. If the owner selling the house does not reside in it at the time of the sale or was not the most recent resident of the house prior to such sale, the exemption in this paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to only one such sale in any 24-month period.</P>
                <P>(2) Rooms or units in dwellings containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his or her residence.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Appropriate corrective action.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The report or results of a self-test are privileged as provided in this subpart if the lender has taken or is taking appropriate corrective action to address likely violations identified by the self-test. Appropriate corrective action is required when a self-test shows it is more likely than not that a violation occurred even though no violation was adjudicated formally.</P>
                <P>(b) A lender must take action reasonably likely to remedy the cause and effect of the likely violation and must:</P>
                <P>(1) Identify the policies or practices that are the likely cause of the violation, such as inadequate or improper lending policies, failure to implement established policies, employee conduct, or other causes; and</P>
                <P>(2) Assess the extent and scope of any likely violation, by determining which areas of operation are likely to be affected by those policies and practices, such as stages of the loan application process, types of loans, or the particular branch where the likely violation has occurred. Generally, the scope of the self-test governs the scope of the appropriate corrective action.</P>
                <P>(c) Appropriate corrective action may include both prospective and remedial relief, except that to establish a privilege under this subpart:</P>
                <P>(1) A lender is not required to provide remedial relief to a tester in a self-test;</P>
                <P>(2) A lender is only required to provide remedial relief to an applicant identified by the self-test as one whose rights were more likely than not violated;</P>
                <P>(3) A lender is not required to provide remedial relief to a particular applicant if the statute of limitations applicable to the violation expired before the lender obtained the results of the self-test or the applicant is otherwise ineligible for such relief.</P>
                <P>(d) Depending on the facts involved, appropriate corrective action may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:</P>

                <P>(1) If the self-test identifies individuals whose applications were inappropriately processed, offering to extend credit if the applications were improperly denied; compensating such persons <PRTPAGE P="682"/>for any damages, both out-of-pocket and compensatory;</P>
                <P>(2) Correcting any institutional policies or procedures that may have contributed to the likely violation, and adopting new policies as appropriate;</P>
                <P>(3) Identifying, and then training and/or disciplining the employees involved;</P>
                <P>(4) Developing outreach programs, marketing strategies, or loan products to serve more effectively the segments of the lender's market that may have been affected by the likely violation; and</P>
                <P>(5) Improving audit and oversight systems to avoid a recurrence of the likely violations.</P>
                <P>(e) Determination of appropriate corrective action is fact-based. Not every corrective measure listed in paragraph (d) of this section need be taken for each likely violation.</P>
                <P>(f) Taking appropriate corrective action is not an admission by a lender that a violation occurred.</P>

                <SUBJECT>General prohibitions against discrimination because of handicap.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) It shall be unlawful to discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of—</P>
                <P>(1) That buyer or renter;</P>
                <P>(2) A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or</P>
                <P>(3) Any person associated with that person.</P>
                <P>(b) It shall be unlawful to discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of—</P>
                <P>(1) That buyer or renter;</P>
                <P>(2) A person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or</P>
                <P>(3) Any person associated with that person.</P>
                <P>(c) It shall be unlawful to make an inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a dwelling, a person intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented or made available, or any person associated with that person, has a handicap or to make inquiry as to the nature or severity of a handicap of such a person. However, this paragraph does not prohibit the following inquiries, provided these inquiries are made of all applicants, whether or not they have handicaps:</P>
                <P>(1) Inquiry into an applicant's ability to meet the requirements of ownership or tenancy;</P>
                <P>(2) Inquiry to determine whether an applicant is qualified for a dwelling available only to persons with handicaps or to persons with a particular type of handicap;</P>
                <P>(3) Inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a dwelling is qualified for a priority available to persons with handicaps or to persons with a particular type of handicap;</P>
                <P>(4) Inquiring whether an applicant for a dwelling is a current illegal abuser or addict of a controlled substance;</P>
                <P>(5) Inquiring whether an applicant has been convicted of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance.</P>
                <P>(d) Nothing in this subpart requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Reasonable modifications of existing premises.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to permit, at the expense of a handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing premises, occupied or to be occupied by a handicapped person, if the proposed modifications may be necessary to afford the handicapped person full enjoyment of the premises of a dwelling. In the case of a rental, <PRTPAGE P="686"/>the landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The landlord may not increase for handicapped persons any customarily required security deposit. However, where it is necessary in order to ensure with reasonable certainty that funds will be available to pay for the restorations at the end of the tenancy, the landlord may negotiate as part of such a restoration agreement a provision requiring that the tenant pay into an interest bearing escrow account, over a reasonable period, a reasonable amount of money not to exceed the cost of the restorations. The interest in any such account shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant.</P>
                <P>(b) A landlord may condition permission for a modification on the renter providing a reasonable description of the proposed modifications as well as reasonable assurances that the work will be done in a workmanlike manner and that any required building permits will be obtained.</P>

                <P>(c) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1):</HD>
                  <P>A tenant with a handicap asks his or her landlord for permission to install grab bars in the bathroom at his or her own expense. It is necessary to reinforce the walls with blocking between studs in order to affix the grab bars. It is unlawful for the landlord to refuse to permit the tenant, at the tenant's own expense, from making the modifications necessary to add the grab bars. However, the landlord may condition permission for the modification on the tenant agreeing to restore the bathroom to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted. It would be reasonable for the landlord to require the tenant to remove the grab bars at the end of the tenancy. The landlord may also reasonably require that the wall to which the grab bars are to be attached be repaired and restored to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. However, it would be unreasonable for the landlord to require the tenant to remove the blocking, since the reinforced walls will not interfere in any way with the landlord's or the next tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises and may be needed by some future tenant.</P>

Further, the landlord may <E T="03">not,</E> in usual circumstances, condition permission for the modification on the applicant paying for the doorway to be narrowed at the end of the lease because a wider doorway will not interfere with the landlord's or the next tenant's use and enjoyment of the premises.</P>

                <P>(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.</P>

                <P>(b) The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                  <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1):</HD>

                  <P>A blind applicant for rental housing wants live in a dwelling unit with a seeing eye dog. The building has a <E T="03">no pets</E> policy. It is a violation of § 100.204 for the owner or manager of the apartment complex to refuse to permit the applicant to live in the apartment with a seeing eye dog because, without the seeing eye dog, the blind person will not have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.</P>

                  <P>Progress Gardens is a 300 unit apartment complex with 450 parking spaces which are available to tenants and guests of Progress Gardens on a <E T="03">first come first served</E> basis. John applies for housing in Progress Gardens. John is mobility impaired and is unable to walk more than a short distance and therefore requests that a parking space near his unit be reserved for him so he will not have to walk very far to get to his apartment. It is a violation of § 100.204 for the owner or manager of Progress Gardens to refuse to make this accommodation. Without a reserved space, John might be unable to live in Progress Gardens at all or, when he has to park in a space far from his unit, might have great difficulty getting from his car to his apartment unit. The accommodation therefore is necessary to afford John an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The accommodation is reasonable because it is feasible and practical under the circumstances.</P>

                <P>(a) Covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 <PRTPAGE P="687"/>shall be designed and constructed to have at least one building entrance on an accessible route unless it is impractical to do so because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. For purposes of this section, a covered multifamily dwelling shall be deemed to be designed and constructed for first occupancy on or before March 13, 1991, if the dwelling is occupied by that date, or if the last building permit or renewal thereof for the dwelling is issued by a State, County or local government on or before June 15, 1990. The burden of establishing impracticality because of terrain or unusual site characteristics is on the person or persons who designed or constructed the housing facility.</P>

                <P>(b) The application of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

                  <P>A real estate developer plans to construct six covered multifamily dwelling units on a site with a hilly terrain. Because of the terrain, it will be necessary to climb a long and steep stairway in order to enter the dwellings. Since there is no practical way to provide an accessible route to any of the dwellings, one need not be provided.</P>

                  <P>A real estate developer plans to construct a building consisting of 10 units of multifamily housing on a waterfront site that floods frequently. Because of this unusual characteristic of the site, the builder plans to construct the building on stilts. It is customary for housing in the geographic area where the site is located to be built on stilts. The housing may lawfully be constructed on the proposed site on stilts even though this means that there will be no practical way to provide an accessible route to the building entrance.</P>

                  <P>A real estate developer plans to construct a multifamily housing facility on a particular site. The developer would like the facility to be built on the site to contain as many units as possible. Because of the configuration and terrain of the site, it is possible to construct a building with 105 units on the site provided the site does not have an accessible route leading to the building entrance. It is also possible to construct a building on the site with an accessible route leading to the building entrance. However, such a building would have no more than 100 dwelling units. The building to be constructed on the site must have a building entrance on an accessible route because it is not impractical to provide such an entrance because of the terrain or unusual characteristics of the site.</P>

                <P>(c) All covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 with a building entrance on an accessible route shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that—</P>
                <P>(1) The public and common use areas are readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
                <P>(2) All the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by handicapped persons in wheelchairs; and</P>
                <P>(3) All premises within covered multifamily dwelling units contain the following features of adaptable design:</P>
                <P>(i) An accessible route into and through the covered dwelling unit;</P>
                <P>(ii) Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations;</P>

                <P>(1) A dwelling unit that is actually occupied by one or more persons on the date that the exemption is claimed; or</P>
                <P>(2) A temporarily vacant unit, if the primary occupant has resided in the unit during the past year and intends to return on a periodic basis.</P>
                <P>(c) For purposes of this subpart, <E T="03">occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older</E> means that on the date the exemption for housing designed for persons who are 55 years of age or older is claimed:</P>
                <P>(1) At least one occupant of the dwelling unit is 55 years of age or older; or</P>
                <P>(2) If the dwelling unit is temporarily vacant, at least one of the occupants immediately prior to the date on which the unit was temporarily vacated was 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(d) Newly constructed housing for first occupancy after March 12, 1989 need not comply with the requirements of this section until at least 25 percent of the units are occupied. For purposes of this section, newly constructed housing includes a facility or community that has been wholly unoccupied for at least 90 days prior to re-occupancy due to renovation or rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(e) Housing satisfies the requirements of this section even though:</P>
                <P>(1) On September 13, 1988, under 80 percent of the occupied units in the housing facility or community were occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older, provided that at least 80 percent of the units occupied by new occupants after September 13, 1988 are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(2) There are unoccupied units, provided that at least 80 percent of the occupied units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(3) There are units occupied by employees of the housing facility or community (and family members residing in the same unit) who are under 55 years of age, provided the employees perform substantial duties related to the management or maintenance of the facility or community.</P>
                <P>(4) There are units occupied by persons who are necessary to provide a reasonable accommodation to disabled residents as required by § 100.204 and who are under the age of 55.</P>
                <P>(5) For a period expiring one year from the effective date of this final regulation, there are insufficient units occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older, but the housing facility or community, at the time the exemption is asserted:</P>
                <P>(i) Has reserved all unoccupied units for occupancy by at least one person 55 years of age or older until at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or older; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Meets the requirements of §§ 100.304, 100.306, and 100.307.</P>
                <P>(f) For purposes of the transition provision described in § 100.305(e)(5), a housing facility or community may not evict, refuse to renew leases, or otherwise penalize families with children who reside in the facility or community in order to achieve occupancy of at least 80 percent of the occupied units by at least one person 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(g) Where application of the 80 percent rule results in a fraction of a unit, that unit shall be considered to be included in the units that must be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(h) Each housing facility or community may determine the age restriction, if any, for units that are not occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older, so long as the housing facility or community complies with the provisions of § 100.306.</P>

                <P>(b) Phrases such as “adult living”, “adult community”, or similar statements in any written advertisement or prospectus are not consistent with the intent that the housing facility or community intends to operate as housing for persons 55 years of age or older.</P>
                <P>(c) If there is language in deed or other community or facility documents which is inconsistent with the intent to provide housing for persons who are 55 years of age or older housing, HUD shall consider documented evidence of a good faith attempt to remove such language in determining whether the housing facility or community complies with the requirements of this section in conjunction with other evidence of intent.</P>
                <P>(d) A housing facility or community may allow occupancy by families with children as long as it meets the requirements of §§ 100.305 and 100.306(a).</P>

                <P>(b) A facility or community shall, within 180 days of the effective date of this rule, develop procedures for routinely determining the occupancy of each unit, including the identification of whether at least one occupant of each unit is 55 years of age or older. Such procedures may be part of a normal leasing or purchasing arrangement.</P>
                <P>(c) The procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section must provide for regular updates, through surveys or other means, of the initial information supplied by the occupants of the housing facility or community. Such updates must take place at least once every two years. A survey may include information regarding whether any units are occupied by persons described in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of § 100.305.</P>
                <P>(d) Any of the following documents are considered reliable documentation of the age of the occupants of the housing facility or community:</P>

                <P>(e) A facility or community shall consider any one of the forms of verification identified above as adequate for verification of age, provided that it contains specific information about current age or date of birth.<PRTPAGE P="692"/>
                </P>
                <P>(f) The housing facility or community must establish and maintain appropriate policies to require that occupants comply with the age verification procedures required by this section.</P>
                <P>(g) If the occupants of a particular dwelling unit refuse to comply with the age verification procedures, the housing facility or community may, if it has sufficient evidence, consider the unit to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. Such evidence may include:</P>
                <P>(1) Government records or documents, such as a local household census;</P>
                <P>(2) Prior forms or applications; or</P>
                <P>(3) A statement from an individual who has personal knowledge of the age of the occupants. The individual's statement must set forth the basis for such knowledge and be signed under the penalty of perjury.</P>
                <P>(h) Surveys and verification procedures which comply with the requirements of this section shall be admissible in administrative and judicial proceedings for the purpose of verifying occupancy.</P>
                <P>(i) A summary of occupancy surveys shall be available for inspection upon reasonable notice and request by any person.</P>

The practice may still be lawful if supported by a legally sufficient justification, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. The burdens of proof for establishing a violation under this subpart are set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Discriminatory effect.</E> A practice has a discriminatory effect where it actually or predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of persons or creates, increases, reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Legally sufficient justification.</E> (1) A legally sufficient justification exists where the challenged practice:</P>
                <P>(i) Is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent, with respect to claims brought under 42 U.S.C. 3612, or defendant, with respect to claims brought under 42 U.S.C. 3613 or 3614; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Those interests could not be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.</P>
                <P>(2) A legally sufficient justification must be supported by evidence and may not be hypothetical or speculative. The burdens of proof for establishing each of the two elements of a legally sufficient justification are set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Burdens of proof in discriminatory effects cases.</E> (1) The charging party, with respect to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. 3612, or the plaintiff, with respect to a claim brought under 42 U.S.C. 3613 or 3614, has the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.</P>
                <P>(2) Once the charging party or plaintiff satisfies the burden of proof set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the respondent or defendant has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent or defendant.</P>
                <P>(3) If the respondent or defendant satisfies the burden of proof set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the charging party or plaintiff may still prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship to discriminatory intent.</E> A demonstration that a practice is supported by a legally sufficient justification, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, may not be used as a <PRTPAGE P="694"/>defense against a claim of intentional discrimination.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin or handicap may violate sections 804, 805, 806 or 818 of the Act, depending on the conduct. The same conduct may violate one or more of these provisions.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Quid pro quo harassment.</E> Quid pro quo harassment refers to an unwelcome request or demand to engage in conduct where submission to the request or demand, either explicitly or implicitly, is made a condition related to: The sale, rental or availability of a dwelling; the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale or rental, or the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith; or the availability, terms, or conditions of a residential real estate-related transaction. An unwelcome request or demand may constitute quid pro quo harassment even if a person acquiesces in the unwelcome request or demand.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Hostile environment harassment.</E> Hostile environment harassment refers to unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to interfere with: The availability, sale, rental, or use or enjoyment of a dwelling; the terms, conditions, or privileges of the sale or rental, or the provision or enjoyment of services or facilities in connection therewith; or the availability, terms, or conditions of a residential real estate-related transaction. Hostile environment harassment does not require a change in the economic benefits, terms, or conditions of the dwelling or housing-related services or facilities, or of the residential real-estate transaction.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Totality of the circumstances.</E> Whether hostile environment harassment exists depends upon the totality of the circumstances.</P>
                <P>(A) Factors to be considered to determine whether hostile environment harassment exists include, but are not limited to, the nature of the conduct, the context in which the incident(s) occurred, the severity, scope, frequency, duration, and location of the conduct, and the relationships of the persons involved.</P>
                <P>(B) Neither psychological nor physical harm must be demonstrated to prove that a hostile environment exists. Evidence of psychological or physical harm may, however, be relevant in determining whether a hostile environment existed and, if so, the amount of damages to which an aggrieved person may be entitled.</P>
                <P>(C) Whether unwelcome conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive as to create a hostile environment is evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person in the aggrieved person's position.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Title VII affirmative defense.</E> The affirmative defense to an employer's vicarious liability for hostile environment harassment by a supervisor under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not apply to cases brought pursuant to the Fair Housing Act.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Type of conduct.</E> Harassment can be written, verbal, or other conduct, and does not require physical contact.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Number of incidents.</E> A single incident of harassment because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or handicap may constitute a discriminatory housing practice, where the incident is sufficiently severe to create a hostile environment, or evidences a quid pro quo.</P>

Where the rights of the aggrieved party and the respondent can be protected and the prohibitions with respect to the disclosure of information can be observed, the investigator may suspend fact finding and engage in efforts to resolve the complaint by conciliation.</P>

The Assistant Secretary's determination shall be based solely on the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practices provided by complainants and respondents and otherwise identified during the investigation in making this determination. In making this determination, the Assistant Secretary shall consider whether the facts concerning the alleged discriminatory housing practice are sufficient to warrant the initiation of a civil action in federal court.</P>
                <P>(i) If the Assistant Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary, upon receipt of concurrence of the General Counsel, will issue such determination and direct the issuance of a charge under § 103.405 on behalf of the aggrieved person, and shall notify the complainant and the respondent of this determination by certified mail or personal service.</P>

                <P>(ii) If the Assistant Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists, the Assistant Secretary shall: Issue a short and plain written statement of the facts upon which the Assistant Secretary has based the no reasonable cause determination; dismiss the complaint; notify the complainant and the respondent of the dismissal (including the written statement of facts) by mail; and make public disclosure of the dismissal. The complainant or respondent may request that no public disclosure be made.

                <P>(b) The Assistant Secretary may not issue a charge under paragraph (a) of this section regarding an alleged discriminatory housing practice, if an aggrieved person has commenced a civil action under an Act of Congress or a state law seeking relief with respect to the alleged housing practice and the trial in the action has commenced. If a charge may not be issued because of the commencement of such a trial, the Assistant Secretary shall so notify the complainant and the respondent by certified mail or personal service.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) A determination of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause by the Assistant Secretary shall be made within 100 days after filing of the complaint (or where the Assistant Secretary has reactivated a complaint, within 100 days after service of the notice of reactivation under § 103.115), unless it is impracticable to do so.</P>

              <P>These regulations are to carry out the requirements of E.O. 11063 that all action necessary and appropriate be taken to prevent discrimination because of race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin in the sale, rental, leasing or other disposition of residential property and related facilities or in the use or occupancy thereof where such property or facilities are owned or operated by the Federal Government, or provided with Federal assistance by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and in the lending practices with respect to residential property and related facilities of lending institutions insofar as such practices relate to loans insured, guaranteed or purchased by the Department. These regulations are intended to assure compliance with the established policy of the United States that the benefits under programs and activities of the Department which provide financial assistance, directly or indirectly, for the provision, rehabilitation, or operation of housing and related facilities are made available without discrimination based on race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin. These regulations are also intended to assure compliance with the policy of this Department to administer its housing programs affirmatively, so as to achieve a condition in which individuals of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin.</P>

              <P>(a) Where allegations of discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin are made in a program or activity of Federal financial assistance of the Department which does not involve a contract of insurance or guaranty, the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and regulations implementing title VI, Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs, under part 1 of this title shall apply. Any complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), sex or national origin in a program or activity of the Department involving a contract of insurance or guaranty will be received and processed according to this part.</P>

              <P>(b) Where a complaint filed pursuant to this part alleges a discriminatory housing practice which is also covered by title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the complainant shall be advised of the right to file a complaint pursuant to section 810 of that title and of <PRTPAGE P="707"/>the availability of Department procedures regarding fair housing complaints under part 105 of this title. The complainant shall also be advised of the right to initiate a civil action in court pursuant to section 812 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 without first filing a complaint with HUD.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Request for interim certification.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) A request for interim certification under this subpart shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary by the <PRTPAGE P="722"/>state or local official having principal responsibility for the administration of the state or local fair housing law. The request shall be supported by the text of the jurisdiction's fair housing law, the law creating and empowering the agency, all laws referenced in the jurisdiction's fair housing law, any regulations and directives issued under the law, and any formal opinions of the State Attorney General or the chief legal officer of the jurisdiction that pertain to the jurisdiction's fair housing law. A request shall also include organizational information of the agency responsible for administering and enforcing the law.</P>
                <P>(b) The request and supporting materials shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-2000. The Assistant Secretary shall forward a copy of the request and supporting materials to the appropriate FHEO regional director. A copy of the request and supporting materials will be kept available for public examination and copying at:</P>
                <P>(1) The office of the Assistant Secretary; and</P>
                <P>(2) The office of the state or local agency charged with administration and enforcement of the state or local fair housing law.</P>
                <P>(c) Upon receipt of a request, HUD will analyze the agency's fair housing law to determine whether it meets the criteria identified in § 115.204.</P>
                <P>(d) HUD shall review a request for interim certification from a local agency located in a state with an interim certified or certified substantially equivalent state agency. However, in the request for interim certification, the local agency must certify that the substantially equivalent state law does not prohibit the local agency from administering and enforcing its own fair housing law within the locality.</P>

                <P>(a) Upon receipt of a request for interim certification filed under § 115.202, the Assistant Secretary may request further information necessary for a determination to be made under this section. The Assistant Secretary may consider the relative priority given to fair housing administration, as compared to the agency's other duties and responsibilities, as well as the compatibility or potential conflict of fair housing objectives with these other duties and responsibilities.</P>
                <P>(b) If the Assistant Secretary determines, after application of the criteria set forth in § 115.204, that the state or local law, on its face, provides substantive rights, procedures, remedies, and judicial review procedures for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Act, the Assistant Secretary may offer to enter into an Agreement for the Interim Referral of Complaints and Other Utilization of Services (interim agreement). The interim agreement will outline the procedures and authorities upon which the interim certification is based.</P>
                <P>(c) Such interim agreement, after it is signed by all appropriate signatories, will result in the agency receiving interim certification. Appropriate signatories include the Assistant Secretary, the FHEO regional director, and the state or local official having principal responsibility for the administration of the state or local fair housing law.</P>
                <P>(d) Interim agreements shall be for a term of no more than three years.</P>
                <P>(e) All regulations, rules, directives, and/or opinions of the State Attorney General or the jurisdiction's chief legal officer that are necessary for the law to be substantially equivalent on its face must be enacted and effective in order for the Assistant Secretary to offer the agency an interim agreement.</P>
                <P>(f) Interim certification required prior to certification. An agency is required to obtain interim certification prior to obtaining certification.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Criteria for adequacy of law.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) In order for a determination to be made that a state or local fair housing agency administers a law, which, on its face, provides rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Act, the law must:<PRTPAGE P="723"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Provide for an administrative enforcement body to receive and process complaints and provide that:</P>
                <P>(i) Complaints must be in writing;</P>
                <P>(ii) Upon the filing of a complaint, the agency shall serve notice upon the complainant acknowledging the filing and advising the complainant of the time limits and choice of forums provided under the law;</P>
                <P>(iii) Upon the filing of a complaint, the agency shall promptly serve notice on the respondent or person charged with the commission of a discriminatory housing practice advising of his or her procedural rights and obligations under the statute or ordinance, together with a copy of the complaint;</P>
                <P>(iv) A respondent may file an answer to a complaint.</P>
                <P>(2) Delegate to the administrative enforcement body comprehensive authority, including subpoena power, to investigate the allegations of complaints, and power to conciliate complaints, and require that:</P>
                <P>(i) The agency commences proceedings with respect to the complaint before the end of the 30th day after receipt of the complaint;</P>
                <P>(ii) The agency investigates the allegations of the complaint and complete the investigation within the timeframe established by section 810(a)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act or comply with the notification requirements of section 810(a)(1)(C) of the Act;</P>
                <P>(iii) The agency make final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year of the date of receipt of a complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the agency is unable to do so, it shall notify the parties, in writing, of the reasons for not doing so;</P>
                <P>(iv) Any conciliation agreement arising out of conciliation efforts by the agency shall be an agreement between the respondent, the complainant, and the agency and shall require the approval of the agency;</P>
                <P>(v) Each conciliation agreement shall be made public, unless the complainant and respondent otherwise agree and the agency determines that disclosure is not required to further the purpose of the law.</P>
                <P>(3) Not place excessive burdens on the aggrieved person that might discourage the filing of complaints, such as:</P>
                <P>(i) A provision that a complaint must be filed within any period of time less than 180 days after an alleged discriminatory practice has occurred or terminated;</P>
                <P>(ii) Anti-testing provisions;</P>
                <P>(iii) Provisions that could subject an aggrieved person to costs, criminal penalties, or fees in connection with the filing of complaints.</P>
                <P>(4) Not contain exemptions that substantially reduce the coverage of housing accommodations as compared to section 803 of the Act.</P>
                <P>(5) Provide the same protections as those afforded by sections 804, 805, 806, and 818 of the Act, consistent with HUD's implementing regulations found at 24 CFR part 100.</P>
                <P>(b) In addition to the factors described in paragraph (a) of this section, the provisions of the state or local law must afford administrative and judicial protection and enforcement of the rights embodied in the law.</P>
                <P>(1) The agency must have the authority to:</P>
                <P>(i) Grant or seek prompt judicial action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of a complaint, if such action is necessary to carry out the purposes of the law;</P>
                <P>(ii) Issue and seek enforceable subpoenas;</P>
                <P>(iii) Grant actual damages in an administrative proceeding or provide adjudication in court at agency expense to allow the award of actual damages to an aggrieved person;</P>
                <P>(iv) Grant injunctive or other equitable relief, or be specifically authorized to seek such relief in a court of competent jurisdiction;</P>
                <P>(v) Provide an administrative proceeding in which a civil penalty may be assessed or provide adjudication in court, at agency expense, allowing the assessment of punitive damages against the respondent.</P>
                <P>(2) If an agency's law offers an administrative hearing, the agency must also provide parties an election option substantially equivalent to the election provisions of section 812 of the Act.</P>

                <P>(3) Agency actions must be subject to judicial review upon application by any <PRTPAGE P="724"/>party aggrieved by a final agency order.</P>
                <P>(4) Judicial review of a final agency order must be in a court with authority to:</P>
                <P>(i) Grant to the petitioner, or to any other party, such temporary relief, restraining order, or other order as the court determines is just and proper;</P>
                <P>(ii) Affirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order, or remand the order for further proceeding; and</P>
                <P>(iii) Enforce the order to the extent that the order is affirmed or modified.</P>
                <P>(c) The requirement that the state or local law prohibit discrimination on the basis of familial status does not require that the state or local law limit the applicability of any reasonable local, state, or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling.</P>
                <P>(d) The state or local law may assure that no prohibition of discrimination because of familial status applies to housing for older persons, as described in 24 CFR part 100, subpart E.</P>
                <P>(e) A determination of the adequacy of a state or local fair housing law “on its face” is intended to focus on the meaning and intent of the text of the law, as distinguished from the effectiveness of its administration. Accordingly, this determination is not limited to an analysis of the literal text of the law. Regulations, directives, rules of procedure, judicial decisions, or interpretations of the fair housing law by competent authorities will be considered in making this determination.</P>
                <P>(f) A law will be found inadequate “on its face” if it permits any of the agency's decision-making authority to be contracted out or delegated to a non-governmental authority. For the purposes of this paragraph, “decision-making authority” includes but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Acceptance of a complaint;</P>
                <P>(2) Approval of a conciliation agreement;</P>
                <P>(3) Dismissal of a complaint;</P>
                <P>(4) Any action specified in § 115.204(a)(2)(iii) or (b)(1); and</P>
                <P>(5) Any decision-making regarding whether a particular matter will or will not be pursued.</P>
                <P>(g) The state or local law must provide for civil enforcement of the law by an aggrieved person by the commencement of an action in an appropriate court at least one year after the occurrence or termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice. The court must be empowered to:</P>
                <P>(1) Award the plaintiff actual and punitive damages;</P>
                <P>(2) Grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any temporary or permanent injunction, temporary restraining order or other order; and</P>
                <P>(3) Allow reasonable attorney's fees and costs.</P>
                <P>(h) If a state or local law is different than the Act in a way that does not diminish coverage of the Act, including, but not limited to, the protection of additional prohibited bases, then the state or local law may still be found substantially equivalent.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Certification procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Certification.</E> (1) If the Assistant Secretary determines, after application of criteria set forth in §§ 115.204, 115.206, and this section, that the state or local law, both “on its face” and “in operation,” provides substantive rights, procedures, remedies, and judicial review procedures for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Act, the Assistant Secretary may enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the agency.</P>
                <P>(2) The MOU is a written agreement providing for the referral of complaints to the agency and for communication procedures between the agency and HUD that are adequate to permit the Assistant Secretary to monitor the agency's continuing substantial equivalency certification.</P>
                <P>(3) The MOU, after it is signed by all appropriate signatories, may authorize an agency to be a certified agency for a period of not more than five years. Appropriate signatories include the Assistant Secretary, the FHEO regional director, and the authorized employee(s) of the agency.</P>

                <P>(b) In order to receive certification, during the 60 days prior to the expiration of the agency's interim agreement, the agency must certify to the Assistant Secretary that the state or local fair housing law, “on its face,” <PRTPAGE P="725"/>continues to be substantially equivalent to the Act (i.e., there have been no amendments to the state or local fair housing law, adoption of rules or procedures concerning the fair housing law, or judicial or other authoritative interpretations of the fair housing law that limit the effectiveness of the agency's fair housing law).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Performance assessments; Performance standards.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Frequency of on-site performance assessment during interim certification.</E> The Assistant Secretary, through the appropriate FHEO regional office, may conduct an on-site performance assessment not later than six months after the execution of the interim agreement. An on-site performance assessment may also be conducted during the six months immediately prior to the expiration of the interim agreement. HUD has the discretion to conduct additional performance assessments during the period of interim certification, as it deems necessary.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Frequency of on-site performance assessment during certification.</E> During certification, the Assistant Secretary through the FHEO regional office, may conduct on-site performance assessments every 24 months. HUD has the discretion to conduct additional performance assessments during the period of certification, as it deems necessary.</P>
                <P>(c) In conducting the performance assessment, the FHEO regional office shall determine whether the agency engages in timely, comprehensive, and thorough fair housing complaint investigation, conciliation, and enforcement activities. In the performance assessment report, the FHEO regional office may recommend to the Assistant Secretary whether the agency should continue to be interim certified or certified. In conducting the performance assessment, the FHEO regional office shall also determine whether the agency is in compliance with the requirements for participation in the FHAP enumerated in §§ 115.307, 115.308, 115.309, 115.310, and 115.311 of this part. In the performance assessment report, the FHEO regional office shall identify whether the agency meets the requirements of §§ 115.307, 115.308, 115.309, 115.310, and 115.311 of this part, and, therefore, should continue receiving funding under the FHAP.</P>
                <P>(d) At a minimum, the performance assessment will consider the following to determine the effectiveness of an agency's fair housing complaint processing, consistent with such guidance as may be issued by HUD:</P>
                <P>(1) The agency's case processing procedures;</P>
                <P>(2) The thoroughness of the agency's case processing;</P>
                <P>(3) A review of cause and no cause determinations for quality of investigations and consistency with appropriate standards;</P>
                <P>(4) A review of conciliation agreements and other settlements;</P>
                <P>(5) A review of the agency's administrative closures; and</P>
                <P>(6) A review of the agency's enforcement procedures, including administrative hearings and judicial proceedings.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Performance standards.</E> HUD shall utilize the following performance standards while conducting performance assessments. If an agency does not meet one or more performance standard(s), HUD shall utilize the performance deficiency procedures enumerated in § 115.210.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Performance Standard 1.</E> Commence complaint proceedings, carry forward such proceedings, complete investigations, issue determinations, and make final administrative dispositions in a timely manner. To meet this standard, the performance assessment will consider the timeliness of the agency's actions with respect to its complaint processing, including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether the agency began its processing of fair housing complaints within 30 days of receipt;</P>
                <P>(ii) Whether the agency completes the investigative activities with respect to a complaint within 100 days from the date of receipt or, if it is impracticable to do so, notifies the parties in writing of the reason(s) for the delay;</P>

                <P>(iii) Whether the agency makes a determination of reasonable cause or no reasonable cause with respect to a complaint within 100 days from the date of receipt or, if it is impracticable <PRTPAGE P="726"/>to do so, notifies the parties in writing of the reason(s) for the delay;</P>
                <P>(iv) Whether the agency makes a final administrative disposition of a complaint within one year from the date of receipt or, if it is impracticable to do so, notifies the parties in writing of the reason(s) for the delay; and</P>
                <P>(v) Whether the agency completed the investigation of the complaint and prepared a complete, final investigative report.</P>
                <P>(vi) When an agency is unable to complete investigative activities with respect to a complaint within 100 days, the agency must send written notification to the parties, indicating the reason(s) for the delay, within 110 days of the filing of the complaint.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Performance Standard 2.</E> Administrative closures are utilized only in limited and appropriate circumstances. Administrative closures should be distinguished from a closure on the merits and may not be used instead of making a recommendation or determination of reasonable or no reasonable cause. HUD will provide further guidance to interim and certified agencies on the appropriate circumstances for administrative closures.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Performance Standard 3.</E> During the period beginning with the filing of a complaint and ending with filing of a charge or dismissal, the agency will, to the extent feasible, attempt to conciliate the complaint. After a charge has been issued, the agency will, to the extent feasible, continue to attempt settlement until a hearing or a judicial proceeding has begun.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Performance Standard 4.</E> The agency conducts compliance reviews of settlements, conciliation agreements, and orders resolving discriminatory housing practices. The performance assessment shall include, but not be limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) An assessment of the agency's procedures for conducting compliance reviews; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Terms and conditions of agreements and orders issued.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Performance Standard 5.</E> The agency must consistently and affirmatively seek and obtain the type of relief designed to prevent recurrences of discriminatory practices. The performance assessment shall include, but not be limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) An assessment of the agency's use of its authority to seek actual damages, as appropriate;</P>
                <P>(ii) An assessment of the agency's use of its authority to seek and assess civil penalties or punitive damages, as appropriate;</P>
                <P>(iii) An assessment of the types of relief sought by the agency with consideration for the inclusion of affirmative provisions designed to protect the public interest;</P>
                <P>(iv) A review of all types of relief obtained;</P>
                <P>(v) A review of the adequacy of the relief sought and obtained in light of the issues raised by the complaint;</P>
                <P>(vi) The number of complaints closed with relief and the number closed without relief;</P>
                <P>(vii) The number of complaints that proceed to administrative hearing and the result; and</P>
                <P>(viii) The number of complaints that proceed to judicial proceedings and the result.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Performance Standard 6.</E> The agency must consistently and affirmatively seek to eliminate all prohibited practices under its fair housing law. An assessment under this standard will include, but not be limited to, an identification of the education and outreach efforts of the agency.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Performance Standard 7.</E> The agency must demonstrate that it receives and processes a reasonable number of complaints cognizable under both the federal Fair Housing Act and the agency's fair housing statute or ordinance. The reasonable number will be determined by HUD and based on all relevant circumstances including, but not limited to, the population of the jurisdiction that the agency serves, the length of time that the agency has participated in the FHAP, and the number of complaints that the agency has received and processed in the past. If an agency fails to receive and process a reasonable number of complaints during a year of FHAP participation, given education and outreach efforts conducted and receipts of complaints, then the FHEO regional director may offer the agency a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), as described in <PRTPAGE P="727"/>§ 115.210(a)(2). The PIP will set forth the number of complaints the agency must process during subsequent years of FHAP participation. After issuing the PIP, the FHEO regional office will provide the agency with technical assistance on ways to increase awareness of fair housing rights and responsibilities in the jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Performance Standard 8.</E> The agency must report to HUD on the final status of all dual-filed complaints where a determination of reasonable cause was made. The report must identify, at a minimum, how complaints were resolved (e.g., settlement, judicial proceedings, or administrative hearing), when they were resolved, the forum in which they were resolved, and types and amounts of relief obtained.</P>
                <P>(9) <E T="03">Performance Standard 9.</E> The agency must conform its performance to the provisions of any written agreements executed by the agency and the Department related to substantial equivalency certification, including, but not limited to, the interim agreement or MOU.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Consequences of interim certification and certification.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Whenever a complaint received by the Assistant Secretary alleges violations of a fair housing law administered by an agency that has been interim certified or certified as substantially equivalent, the complaint will be referred to the agency, and no further action shall be taken by the Assistant Secretary with respect to such complaint except as provided for by the Act, this part, 24 CFR part 103, subpart C, and any written agreements executed by the Agency and the Assistant Secretary. HUD shall make referrals to interim certified and certified local agencies in accordance with this section even when the local agency is located in a state with an interim certified or certified state agency.</P>
                <P>(b) If HUD determines that a complaint has not been processed in a timely manner in accordance with the performance standards set forth in § 115.206, HUD may reactivate the complaint, conduct its own investigation and conciliation efforts, and make a determination consistent with 24 CFR part 103.</P>
                <P>(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, whenever the Assistant Secretary has reason to believe that a complaint demonstrates a basis for the commencement of proceedings against any respondent under section 814(a) of the Act or for proceedings by any governmental licensing or supervisory authorities, the Assistant Secretary shall transmit the information upon which such belief is based to the Attorney General, federal financial regulatory agencies, other federal agencies, or other appropriate governmental licensing or supervisory authorities.</P>

                <P>(a) If the Assistant Secretary affirmatively concludes that the agency's law and performance have complied with the requirements of this part in each of the five years of certification, the Assistant Secretary may renew the certification of the agency.</P>
                <P>(b) In determining whether to renew the certification of an agency, the Assistant Secretary's review may include, but is not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Performance assessments of the agency conducted by the Department during the five years of certification;</P>
                <P>(2) The agency's own certification that the state or local fair housing law continues to be substantially equivalent both “on its face” and “in operation;” (i.e., there have been no amendments to the state or local fair housing law, adoption of rules or procedures concerning the fair housing law, or judicial or other authoritative interpretations of the fair housing law that limit the effectiveness of the agency's fair housing law); and</P>
                <P>(3) Any and all public comments regarding the relevant state and local laws and the performance of the agency in enforcing the law.</P>
                <P>(c) If the Assistant Secretary decides to renew an agency's certification, the Assistant Secretary will offer the agency either a new MOU or an Addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding (addendum). The new MOU or addendum will extend and update the MOU between HUD and the agency.</P>

                <P>(d) The new MOU or addendum, when signed by all appropriate signatories, will result in the agency's certification <PRTPAGE P="728"/>being renewed for five years from the date on which the previous MOU was to expire. Appropriate signatories include the Assistant Secretary, the FHEO regional director, and the authorized employee(s) of the agency.</P>
                <P>(e) The provisions of this section may be applied to an agency that has an expired MOU or an expired addendum.</P>

                <P>(a) HUD may utilize the following performance deficiency procedures if it determines at any time that the agency does not meet one or more of the performance standards enumerated in § 115.206. The performance deficiency procedures may be applied to agencies with either interim certification or certification. If an agency fails to meet performance standard 7, HUD may bypass the technical assistance performance deficiency procedure and proceed to the PIP.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Technical assistance.</E> After discovering the deficiency, the FHEO regional office should immediately inform the agency and provide the agency with technical assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Performance improvement plan.</E> If, following technical assistance, the agency does not bring its performance into compliance with § 115.206 within a time period identified by the FHEO regional director, the FHEO regional director may offer the agency a PIP.</P>
                <P>(i) The PIP will outline the agency's performance deficiencies, identify the necessary corrective actions, and include a timetable for completion.</P>
                <P>(ii) If the agency receives a PIP, funding under the FHAP may be suspended for the duration of the PIP.</P>
                <P>(iii) Once the agency has implemented the corrective actions to eliminate the deficiencies, and such corrective actions are accepted by the FHEO regional director, funding may be restored.</P>
                <P>(iv) The FHEO regional office may provide the agency with technical assistance during the period of the PIP, if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension.</E> If the agency does not agree to implement the PIP or does not implement the corrective actions identified in the PIP within the time allotted, then the FHEO regional director may suspend the agency's interim certification or certification.</P>
                <P>(1) The FHEO regional director shall notify the agency in writing of the specific reasons for the suspension and provide the agency with an opportunity to respond within 30 days.</P>
                <P>(2) Suspension shall not exceed 180 days.</P>
                <P>(3) During the period of suspension, HUD will not refer complaints to the agency.</P>
                <P>(4) If an agency is suspended, the FHEO regional office may elect not to provide funding under the FHAP to the agency during the period of suspension, unless and until the Assistant Secretary determines that the agency is fully in compliance with § 115.206.</P>
                <P>(5) HUD may provide the agency with technical assistance during the period of suspension, if appropriate.</P>
                <P>(6) No more than 60 days prior to the end of suspension, the FHEO regional office shall conduct a performance assessment of the agency.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Withdrawal.</E> If, following the performance assessment conducted at the end of suspension, the Assistant Secretary determines that the agency has not corrected the deficiencies, the Assistant Secretary may propose to withdraw the interim certification or certification of the agency.</P>

                <P>(1) The Assistant Secretary shall proceed with withdrawal, unless the agency provides information or documentation that establishes that the agency's administration of its law meets all of <PRTPAGE P="729"/>the substantial equivalency certification criteria set forth in 24 CFR part 115.</P>
                <P>(2) The Assistant Secretary shall inform the agency in writing of the reasons for the withdrawal.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Changes limiting effectiveness of agency's law.</E> (1) If a state or local fair housing law that HUD has previously deemed substantially equivalent to the Act is amended; or rules or procedures concerning the fair housing law are adopted; or judicial or other authoritative interpretations of the fair housing law are issued, the interim-certified or certified agency must inform the Assistant Secretary of such amendment, adoption, or interpretation within 60 days of its discovery.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Corrective actions.</E> (1) If the review indicates that the agency's law no longer meets the criteria identified in § 115.204, the Assistant Secretary will so notify the agency in writing. Following notification, HUD may take appropriate actions, including, but not limited to, any or all of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) Declining to refer some or all complaints to the agency unless and until the fair housing law meets the criteria identified in § 115.204;</P>
                <P>(ii) Electing not to provide payment for complaints processed by the agency unless and until the fair housing law meets the criteria identified in § 115.204;</P>
                <P>(iii) Providing technical assistance and/or guidance to the agency to assist the agency in curing deficiencies in its fair housing law.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Suspension based on changes in the law.</E> If the corrective actions identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section fail to bring the state or local fair housing law back into compliance with the criteria identified in § 115.204 within the timeframe identified in HUD's notification to the agency, the Assistant Secretary may suspend the agency's interim certification or certification based on changes in the law or a related law.</P>
                <P>(i) The Assistant Secretary will notify the agency in writing of the specific reasons for the suspension and provide the agency with an opportunity to respond within 30 days.</P>
                <P>(ii) During the period of suspension, the Assistant Secretary has the discretion to not refer some or all complaints to the agency unless and until the agency's law meets the criteria identified in § 115.204.</P>
                <P>(iii) During suspension, HUD may elect not to provide payment for complaints processed unless and until the agency's law meets the criteria identified in § 115.204.</P>
                <P>(iv) During the period of suspension, if the fair housing law is brought back into compliance with the criteria identified in § 115.204, and the Assistant Secretary determines that the fair housing law remains substantially equivalent to the Act, the Assistant Secretary will rescind the suspension and reinstate the agency's interim certification or certification.</P>

                <P>(i) The Assistant Secretary will proceed with withdrawal unless the agency provides information or documentation that establishes that the agency's current law meets the criteria of substantial equivalency certification identified in § 115.204.<PRTPAGE P="730"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The Assistant Secretary will inform the agency in writing of the reasons for the withdrawal.</P>
                <P>(c)(1) If, following notification from HUD that its fair housing law no longer meets the criteria identified in § 115.204, an interim-certified or certified agency unequivocally expresses to HUD that its fair housing law will not be brought back into compliance, the Assistant Secretary may forgo suspension and proceed directly to withdrawal of the agency's interim certification or certification.</P>
                <P>(2) During any period after which the Assistant Secretary proposes withdrawal, until such time as the agency establishes that administration of its law meets all of the substantial equivalency certification criteria set forth in 24 CFR part 115, the agency shall be ineligible for funding under the FHAP.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Consequences of repeal.</E> If a state or local fair housing law that HUD has previously deemed substantially equivalent to the Act is repealed, in whole or in part, or a related law that bears on any aspect of the effectiveness of the agency's fair housing law is repealed, in whole or in part, the Assistant Secretary may immediately withdraw the agency's interim certification or certification.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Changes not limiting effectiveness.</E> Nothing in this section is meant to limit the Assistant Secretary's authority to determine that a change to a fair housing law does not jeopardize the substantial equivalency interim certification or certification of an agency.</P>
                <P>(1) Under such circumstances, the Assistant Secretary may proceed in maintaining the existing relationship with the agency, as set forth in the interim agreement or MOU.</P>
                <P>(2) Alternatively, the Assistant Secretary may decide not to refer certain types of complaints to the agency. The Assistant Secretary may elect not to provide payment for these complaints and may require the agency to refer such complaints to the Department for investigation, conciliation, and enforcement activities.</P>
                <P>(3) When the Assistant Secretary determines that a change to a fair housing law does not jeopardize an agency's substantial equivalency certification, the Assistant Secretary need not proceed to suspension or withdrawal if the change is not reversed.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Capacity building funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Capacity building (CB) funds are funds that HUD may provide to an agency with interim certification.</P>
                <P>(b) CB funds will be provided in a fixed annual amount to be utilized for the eligible activities established pursuant to § 115.303. When the fixed annual amount will not adequately compensate an agency in its first year of participation in the FHAP due to the large number of fair housing complaints that the agency reasonably anticipates processing, HUD may provide the agency with additional funds.</P>
                <P>(c) HUD may provide CB funds during an agency's first three years of participation in the FHAP. However, in the second and third year of the agency's participation in the FHAP, HUD has the option to permit the agency to receive contribution funds under § 115.304, instead of CB funds.</P>
                <P>(d) In order to receive CB funding, agencies must submit a statement of work prior to the signing of the cooperative agreement. The statement of work must identify:</P>
                <P>(1) The objectives and activities to be carried out with the CB funds received;</P>
                <P>(2) A plan for training all of the agency's employees involved in the administration of the agency's fair housing law;</P>

                <P>(4) A description of the agency's complaint processing data and information system, or, alternatively, whether the agency plans to use CB funds to purchase and install a data system;</P>
                <P>(5) A description of any other fair housing activities that the agency will undertake with its CB funds. All such activities must address matters affecting fair housing enforcement that are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act. Any activities that do not address the implementation of the agency's fair housing law, and that are therefore not cognizable under the Fair Housing Act, will be disapproved.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Agencies eligible for contributions funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) An agency that has received CB funds for one to three consecutive years may be eligible for contributions funding. Contributions funding consists of five categories:</P>
                <P>(1) Complaint processing (CP) funds;</P>
                <P>(2) Special enforcement effort (SEE) funds (see § 115.305);</P>
                <P>(3) Training funds (see § 115.306);</P>
                <P>(4) Administrative cost (AC) funds; and</P>
                <P>(5) Partnership (P) funds.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">CP funds.</E> (1) Agencies receiving CP funds will receive such support based solely on the number of complaints processed by the agency and accepted for payment by the FHEO regional director during a consecutive, specifically identified, 12-month period. The 12-month period will be identified in the cooperative agreement between HUD and the agency. The FHEO regional office shall determine whether or not cases are acceptably processed <PRTPAGE P="732"/>based on requirements enumerated in the cooperative agreement and its attachments/appendices, performance standards set forth in 24 CFR 115.206, and provisions of the interim agreement or MOU.</P>
                <P>(2) The amount of funding to agencies that are new to contributions funding will be based on the number of complaints acceptably processed by the agency during the specifically identified 12-month period preceding the signing of the cooperative agreement.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">AC funds.</E> (1) Agencies that acceptably process 100 or more cases will receive no less than 10 percent of the agency's total FHAP payment amount for the preceding year, in addition to CP funds, contingent on fiscal year appropriations. Agencies that acceptably process fewer than 100 cases will receive a flat rate, contingent on fiscal year appropriations.</P>
                <P>(2) Agencies will be required to provide HUD with a statement of how they intend to use the AC funds. HUD may require that some or all AC funding be directed to activities designed to create, modify, or improve local, regional, or national information systems concerning fair housing matters (including the purchase of state-of-the-art computer systems, obtaining and maintaining Internet access, etc.).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">P funds.</E> The purpose of P funds is for an agency participating in the FHAP to utilize the services of individuals and/or public, private, for-profit, or not-for-profit organizations that have expertise needed to effectively carry out the provisions of the agency's fair housing law. P funds are fixed amounts and shall be allocated based on the FHAP appropriation. Agencies must consult with the CAO and GTR in identifying appropriate usage of P funds for the geographical area that the agency services. Some examples of proper P fund usage include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(1) Contracting with qualified organizations to conduct fair housing testing in appropriate cases;</P>
                <P>(2) Hiring experienced, temporary staff to assist in the investigation of complex or aged cases;</P>
                <P>(3) Partnering with grassroots, faith-based or other community-based organizations to conduct education and outreach to people of different backgrounds on how to live together peacefully in the same housing complex, neighborhood, or community;</P>
                <P>(4) Contracting with individuals outside the agency who have special expertise needed for the investigation of fair housing cases (e.g., architects for design and construction cases or qualified individuals from colleges and universities for the development of data and statistical analyses).</P>

                <P>(a) SEE funds are funds that HUD may provide to an agency to enhance enforcement activities of the agency's fair housing law. SEE funds will be a maximum of 20 percent of the agency's total FHAP cooperative agreement for the previous contract year, based on approval of eligible activity or activities, and contingent upon the appropriation of funds. All agencies receiving contributions funds are eligible to receive SEE funds if they meet three of the six criteria set out in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section:</P>
                <P>(1) The agency enforced a subpoena or made use of its prompt judicial action authority within the past year;</P>
                <P>(2) The agency has held at least one administrative hearing or has had at least one case on a court's docket for civil proceedings during the past year;</P>
                <P>(3) At least ten percent of the agency's fair housing caseload resulted in written conciliation agreements providing monetary relief for the complainant as well as remedial action, monitoring, reporting, and public interest relief provisions;</P>
                <P>(4) The agency has had in the most recent three years, or is currently engaged in, at least one major fair housing systemic investigation requiring an exceptional amount of funds expenditure;</P>

                <P>(5) The agency's administration of its fair housing law received meritorious mention for its fair housing complaint processing or other fair housing activities that were innovative. The meritorious mention criterion may be met by an agency's successful fair housing work being identified and/or published by a reputable source. Examples of <PRTPAGE P="733"/>meritorious mention include, but are not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) An article in a minority newspaper or a newspaper of general circulation that identifies the agency's role in the successful resolution of a housing discrimination complaint;</P>
                <P>(ii) A letter from a sponsoring organization of a fair housing conference or symposium that identifies the agency's successful participation and presentation at the conference or symposium;</P>
                <P>(iii) A letter of praise, proclamation, or other formal documentation from the mayor, county executive, or governor recognizing the fair housing achievement of the agency.</P>
                <P>(6) The agency has completed the investigation of at least 10 fair housing complaints during the previous funding year.</P>
                <P>(b) Regardless of whether an agency meets the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, an agency is ineligible for SEE funds if:</P>
                <P>(1) Twenty percent or more of an agency's fair housing complaints result in administrative closures; or</P>
                <P>(2) The agency is currently on a PIP, or its interim certification or certification has been suspended during the federal fiscal year in which SEE funds are sought.</P>

                <P>(c) SEE funding amounts are subject to the FHAP appropriation by Congress and will be described in writing in the cooperative agreements annually. HUD will periodically publish a list of activities eligible for SEE funding in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

                <SUBJECT>Training funds.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) All agencies, including agencies that receive CB funds, are eligible to receive training funds. Training funds are fixed amounts based on the number of agency employees to be trained. Training funds shall be allocated based on the FHAP appropriation. Training funds may be used only for HUD-approved or HUD-sponsored training. Agency-initiated training or other formalized training may be included in this category. However, such training must first be approved by the CAO and the GTR. Specifics on the amount of training funds that an agency will receive and, if applicable, amounts that may be deducted, will be set out in the cooperative agreement each year.</P>
                <P>(b) Each agency must send staff to mandatory FHAP training sponsored by HUD, including, but not necessarily limited to, the National Fair Housing Training Academy and the National Fair Housing Policy Conference. If the agency does not participate in mandatory HUD-approved and HUD-sponsored training, training funds will be deducted from the agency's overall training amount. All staff of the agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the fair housing law must participate in HUD-approved or HUD-sponsored training each year.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Requirements for participation in the FHAP; Corrective and remedial action for failing to comply with requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Agencies that participate in the FHAP must meet the requirements enumerated in this section. The FHEO regional office shall review the agency's compliance with the requirements of this section when it conducts on-site performance assessments in accordance with § 115.206. The requirements for participation in the FHAP are as follows:</P>
                <P>(1) The agency must conform to all reporting and record maintenance requirements set forth in § 115.308, as well as any additional reporting and record maintenance requirements identified by the Assistant Secretary.</P>
                <P>(2) The agency must agree to on-site technical assistance and guidance and implementation of corrective actions set out by the Department in response to deficiencies found during the technical assistance or performance assessment evaluations of the agency's operations.</P>
                <P>(3) The agency must use the Department's official complaint data information system and must input all relevant data and information into the system in a timely manner.</P>

                <P>(4) The agency must agree to implement and adhere to policies and procedures (as the agency's laws allow) provided to the agency by the Assistant Secretary, including, but not limited <PRTPAGE P="734"/>to, guidance on investigative techniques, case file preparation and organization, and implementation of data elements for complaint tracking.</P>
                <P>(5) If an agency that participates in the FHAP enforces antidiscrimination laws other than a fair housing law (e.g., administration of a fair employment law), the agency must annually provide a certification to HUD stating that it spends at least 20 percent of its total annual budget on fair housing activities. The term “total annual budget,” as used in this subsection, means the entire budget assigned by the jurisdiction to the agency for enforcing and administering antidiscrimination laws, but does not include FHAP funds.</P>
                <P>(6) The agency may not co-mingle FHAP funds with other funds. FHAP funds must be segregated from the agency's and the state or local government's other funds and must be used for the purpose that HUD provided the funds.</P>
                <P>(7) An agency may not unilaterally reduce the level of financial resources currently committed to fair housing activities (budget and staff reductions or other actions outside the control of the agency will not, alone, result in a negative determination for the agency's participation in the FHAP).</P>
                <P>(8) The agency must comply with the provisions, certifications, and assurances required in any and all written agreements executed by the agency and the Department related to participation in the FHAP, including, but not limited to, the cooperative agreement.</P>
                <P>(9) The agency must draw down its funds in a timely manner.</P>
                <P>(10) The agency must be audited and receive copies of the audit reports in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the state and local government in which it is located.</P>
                <P>(11) The agency must participate in all required training, as described in § 115.306(b).</P>
                <P>(12) If the agency subcontracts any activity for which the subcontractor will receive FHAP funds, the agency must conform to the subcontracting requirements of § 115.309.</P>
                <P>(13) If the agency receives a complaint that may implicate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, then the agency must conform to the requirements of § 115.310.</P>
                <P>(14) If the agency utilizes FHAP funds to conduct fair housing testing, then the agency must conform to the requirements of § 115.311.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Corrective and remedial action for failing to comply with requirements.</E> The agency's refusal to provide information, assist in implementation, or carry out the requirements of this section may result in the denial or interruption of its receipt of FHAP funds. Prior to denying or interrupting an agency's receipt of FHAP funds, HUD will put the agency on notice of its intent to deny or interrupt. HUD will identify its rationale for the denial or interruption and provide the agency with an opportunity to respond within a reasonable period of time. If, within the time period requested, the agency does not provide information or documentation indicating that the requirement(s) enumerated in this section is/are met, HUD may proceed with the denial or interruption of FHAP funds. If, at any time following the denial or interruption, HUD learns that the agency meets the requirements enumerated in this section, HUD may opt to reinstate the agency's receipt of FHAP funds.</P>

                <P>(2) Its performance under the FHAP.</P>
                <P>(b) The agency will provide to the FHEO regional director reports maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. The agency will provide reports to the FHEO regional director in accordance with the frequency and content requirements identified in the cooperative agreement. In addition, the agency will provide reports on the final status of complaints following reasonable cause findings, in accordance with Performance Standard 8 identified in § 115.206.</P>

                <P>(c) The agency will permit reasonable public access to its records consistent with the jurisdiction's requirements for release of information.

                <P>(d) The Secretary, Inspector General of HUD, and the Comptroller General of the United States or any of their duly authorized representatives shall have access to all pertinent books, accounts, reports, files, and other payments for surveys, audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts as they relate to the agency's participation in FHAP.</P>
                <P>(e) All files will be kept in such fashion as to permit audits under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Certification of compliance with part 135.</E> All notices of funding availability (NOFAs) issued by HUD that announce the availability of funding covered by section 3 shall include a provision in the NOFA that notifies applicants that section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to funding awards made under the NOFA. Additionally the NOFA shall require as an application submission requirement (which may be specified in the NOFA or application kit) a certification by the applicant that the applicant will comply with the regulations in part 135. (For PHAs, this requirement will be met where a PHA Resolution in Support of the Application is submitted.) With respect to application evaluation, HUD will accept an applicant's certification unless there is evidence substantially challenging the certification.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement of purpose in NOFAs.</E> (1) For competitively awarded assistance in which the grants are for activities administered by an HA, and those activities are anticipated to generate significant training, employment or contracting opportunities, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.</P>
                <P>(2) For competitively awarded assistance involving housing rehabilitation, construction or other public construction, where the amount awarded to the applicant may exceed $200,000, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Section 3 as NOFA evaluation criteria.</E> Where not otherwise precluded by statute, in the evaluation of applications for the award of assistance, consideration shall be given to the extent to which an applicant has demonstrated that it will train and employ section 3 residents and contract with section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities generated in connection with the assisted project or activity.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Procurement standards for States and local governments 2 CFR part 200, subpart D</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Nothing in this part 135 prescribes specific methods of procurement. However, neither section 3 nor the requirements of this part 135 supersede the general requirement of 2 CFR 200.319 that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner. Consistent with 2 CFR 200.319, section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages, to the maximum extent feasible, a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Flexible Subsidy Program.</E> Multifamily project mortgagors in the Flexible Subsidy Program are not required to utilize the methods of procurement in 2 CFR 200.320, and are not permitted to utilize methods of procurement that would result in their award of a contract to a business concern that submits a bid higher than the lowest responsive bid. A multifamily project mortgagor, however, must ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement practices it selects provide preference to section 3 business concerns.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Procurement standards for other recipients (2 CFR part 200, subpart D).</E> Nothing in this part prescribes specific methods of procurement for grants and other agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations. Consistent with the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, section 3 is a <PRTPAGE P="747"/>Federal statute that expressly encourages a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Federal labor standards provisions.</E> Certain construction contracts are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wages determined under Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a—276a-7) and implementing U.S. Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5. Additionally, certain HUD-assisted rehabilitation and maintenance activities on public and Indian housing developments are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates, as determined or adopted by HUD, to laborers and mechanics employed in this work. Apprentices and trainees may be utilized on this work only to the extent permitted under either Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR part 5 or for work subject to HUD-determined prevailing wage rates, HUD policies and guidelines. These requirements include adherence to the wage rates and ratios of apprentices or trainees to journeymen set out in “approved apprenticeship and training programs,” as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Approved apprenticeship and trainee programs.</E> Certain apprenticeship and trainee programs have been approved by various Federal agencies. Approved apprenticeship and trainee programs include: an apprenticeship program approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training of the Department of Labor, or a State Apprenticeship Agency, or an on-the-job training program approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, in accordance with the regulations at 29 CFR part 5; or a training program approved by HUD in accordance with HUD policies and guidelines, as applicable. Participation in an approved apprenticeship program does not, in and of itself, demonstrate compliance with the regulations of this part.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Compliance with Executive Order 11246.</E> Certain contractors covered by this part are subject to compliance with Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 12086, and the Department of Labor regulations issued pursuant thereto (41 CFR chapter 60) which provide that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in all phases of employment during the performance of Federal or Federally assisted construction contracts.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Section 3 clause.</SUBJECT>

                <P>All section 3 covered contracts shall include the following clause (referred to as the section 3 clause):
                </P>
                <EXTRACT>
                  <P>A. The work to be performed under this contract is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u (section 3). The purpose of section 3 is to ensure that employment and other economic opportunities generated by HUD assistance or HUD-assisted projects covered by section 3, shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed to low- and very low-income persons, particularly persons who are recipients of HUD assistance for housing.</P>
                  <P>B. The parties to this contract agree to comply with HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 135, which implement section 3. As evidenced by their execution of this contract, the parties to this contract certify that they are under no contractual or other impediment that would prevent them from complying with the part 135 regulations.</P>
                  <P>C. The contractor agrees to send to each labor organization or representative of workers with which the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement or other understanding, if any, a notice advising the labor organization or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under this section 3 clause, and will post copies of the notice in conspicuous places at the work site where both employees and applicants for training and employment positions can see the notice. The notice shall describe the section 3 preference, shall set forth minimum number and job titles subject to hire, availability of apprenticeship and training positions, the qualifications for each; and the name and location of the person(s) taking applications for each of the positions; and the anticipated date the work shall begin.</P>
                  <P>D. The contractor agrees to include this section 3 clause in every subcontract subject to compliance with regulations in 24 CFR part 135, and agrees to take appropriate action, as provided in an applicable provision of the subcontract or in this section 3 clause, upon a finding that the subcontractor is in violation of the regulations in 24 CFR part 135. The contractor will not subcontract with any subcontractor where the contractor has notice or knowledge that the subcontractor has been found in violation of the regulations in 24 CFR part 135.</P>
                  <P>E. The contractor will certify that any vacant employment positions, including training positions, that are filled (1) after the contractor is selected but before the contract is executed, and (2) with persons other than those to whom the regulations of 24 CFR part 135 require employment opportunities to be directed, were not filled to circumvent the contractor's obligations under 24 CFR part 135.</P>
                  <P>F. Noncompliance with HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 135 may result in sanctions, termination of this contract for default, and debarment or suspension from future HUD assisted contracts.</P>
                  <P>G. With respect to work performed in connection with section 3 covered Indian housing assistance, section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e) also applies to the work to be performed under this contract. Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible (i) preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians, and (ii) preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned Economic Enterprises. Parties to this contract that are subject to the provisions of section 3 and section 7(b) agree to comply with section 3 to the maximum extent feasible, but not in derogation of compliance with section 7(b).</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> In accordance with the findings of the Congress, as stated in section 3, that other economic opportunities offer an effective means of empowering low-income persons, a recipient is encouraged to undertake efforts to provide to low-income persons economic opportunities other than training, employment, and contract awards, in connection with section 3 covered assistance.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Other training and employment related opportunities.</E> Other economic opportunities to train and employ section 3 residents include, but need not be limited to, use of “upward mobility”, “bridge” and trainee positions to fill vacancies; hiring section 3 residents in <PRTPAGE P="752"/>management and maintenance positions within other housing developments; and hiring section 3 residents in part-time positions.</P>

A recipient or contractor may employ these methods directly or may provide incentives to non-section 3 businesses to utilize such methods to provide other economic opportunities to low-income persons.</P>
                <P>(2) A <E T="03">section 3 joint venture</E> means an association of business concerns, one of which qualifies as a section 3 business concern, formed by written joint venture agreement to engage in and carry out a specific business venture for which purpose the business concerns combine their efforts, resources, and skills for joint profit, but not necessarily on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally, and for which the section 3 business concern:</P>

                <P>(a) The Assistant Secretary recognizes that the success of ensuring that section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns have the opportunity to apply for jobs and to bid for contracts generated by covered HUD financial assistance depends upon the cooperation and assistance of HUD recipients and their contractors and subcontractors. All recipients shall cooperate fully and promptly with the Assistant Secretary in section 3 compliance reviews, in investigations of allegations of noncompliance made under § 135.76, and with the distribution and collection of data and information that the Assistant Secretary may require in connection with achieving the economic objectives of section 3.</P>

Except for the purposes of notifying respondents, amended complaints will be considered as having been made as of the original filing date.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Resolution of complaint by recipient.</E> (1) Within ten (10) days of timely filing of a complaint that contains complete information (in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section), the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether the complainant alleges an action or omission by a recipient or the recipient's contractor that if proven qualifies as noncompliance with section 3. If a determination is made that there is an allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the complaint shall be sent to the recipient for resolution.</P>
                <P>(2) If the recipient believes that the complaint lacks merit, the recipient must notify the Assistant Secretary in writing of this recommendation with supporting reasons, within 30 days of the date of receipt of the complaint. The determination that a complaint lacks merit is reserved to the Assistant Secretary.</P>
                <P>(3) If the recipient determines that there is merit to the complaint, the recipient will have sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the complaint to resolve the matter with the complainant. At the expiration of the 60-day period, the recipient must notify the Assistant Secretary in writing whether a resolution of the complaint has been reached. If resolution has been reached, the notification must be signed by both the recipient and the complainant, and must summarize the terms of the resolution reached between the two parties.</P>
                <P>(4) Any request for an extension of the 60-day period by the recipient must be submitted in writing to the Assistant Secretary, and must include a statement explaining the need for the extension.</P>
                <P>(5) If the recipient is unable to resolve the complaint within the 60-day period (or more if extended by the Assistant Secretary), the complaint shall be referred to the Assistant Secretary for handling.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Informal resolution of complaint by Assistant Secretary</E>—(1) <E T="03">Dismissal of complaint.</E> Upon receipt of the recipient's written recommendation that there is no merit to the complaint, or upon failure of the recipient and complainant to reach resolution, the Assistant Secretary shall review the complaint to determine whether it presents a valid <PRTPAGE P="755"/>allegation of noncompliance with section 3. The Assistant Secretary may conduct further investigation if deemed necessary. Where the complaint fails to present a valid allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the Assistant Secretary will dismiss the complaint without further action. The Assistant Secretary shall notify the complainant of the dismissal of the complaint and the reasons for the dismissal.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Informal resolution.</E> Where the allegations in a complaint on their face, or as amplified by the statements of the complainant, present a valid allegation of noncompliance with section 3, the Assistant Secretary will attempt, through informal methods, to obtain a voluntary and just resolution of the complaint. Where attempts to resolve the complaint informally fail, the Assistant Secretary will impose a resolution on the recipient and complainant. Any resolution imposed by the Assistant Secretary will be in accordance with requirements and procedures concerning the imposition of sanctions or resolutions as set forth in the regulations governing the HUD program under which the section 3 covered assistance was provided.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Effective date of informal resolution.</E> The imposed resolution will become effective and binding at the expiration of 15 days following notification to recipient and complainant by certified mail of the imposed resolution, unless either party appeals the resolution before the expiration of the 15 days. Any appeal shall be in writing to the Secretary and shall include the basis for the appeal.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Sanctions.</E> Sanctions that may be imposed on recipients that fail to comply with the regulations of this part include debarment, suspension and limited denial of participation in HUD programs.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Investigation of complaint.</E> The Assistant Secretary reserves the right to investigate a complaint directly when, in the Assistant Secretary's discretion, the investigation would further the purposes of section 3 and this part.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.</E> No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person or business because the person or business has made a complaint, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.</P>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Judicial relief.</E> Nothing in this subpart D precludes a section 3 resident or section 3 business concerning from exercising the right, which may otherwise be available, to seek redress directly through judicial procedures.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Small Purchase Procedures.</E> For section 3 covered contracts aggregating no more than $25,000, the methods set forth in this paragraph (1) or the more formal procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Section III may be utilized.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Solicitation.</E> (A) Quotations may be solicited by telephone, letter or other informal procedure provided that the manner of solicitation provides for participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. At the time of solicitation, the parties must be informed of:</P>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—the section 3 covered contract to be awarded with sufficient specificity;</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—the time within which quotations must be submitted; and</FP>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">—the information that must be submitted with each quotation.</FP>
                
                <P>(B) If the method described in paragraph (i)(A) is utilized, there must be an attempt to obtain quotations from a minimum of three qualified sources in order to promote competition. Fewer than three quotations are acceptable when the contracting party has attempted, but has been unable, to obtain a sufficient number of competitive quotations. In unusual circumstances, the contracting party may accept the sole quotation received in response to a solicitation provided the price is reasonable. In all cases, the contracting party shall document the circumstances when it has been unable to obtain at least three quotations.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Award.</E> (A) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based upon the lowest price, the contract shall be awarded to the qualified section 3 business concern with the lowest responsive quotation, if it is reasonable and no more than 10 percent higher than the quotation of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source. If no responsive quotation by a qualified section 3 business concern is within 10 percent of the lowest responsive quotation from any qualified source, the award shall be made to the source with the lowest quotation.</P>
                <P>(B) Where the section 3 covered contract is to be awarded based on factors other than price, a request for quotations shall be issued by developing the particulars of the solicitation, including a rating system for the assignment of points to evaluate the merits of each quotation. The solicitation shall identify all factors to be considered, including price or cost. The rating system shall provide for a range of 15 to 25 percent of the total number of available rating points to be set aside for the provision of preference for section 3 business concerns. The purchase order shall be awarded to the responsible firm whose quotation is the most advantageous, considering price and all other factors specified in the rating system.</P>

                <P>(i) Bids shall be solicited from all businesses (section 3 business concerns, and non-section 3 business concerns). An award shall be made to the qualified section 3 business concern with the highest priority ranking and with the lowest responsive bid if that bid—</P>
                <P>(A) is within the maximum total contract price established in the contracting party's budget for the specific project for which bids are being taken, and</P>
                <P>(B) is not more than “X” higher than the total bid price of the lowest responsive bid from any responsible bidder. “X” is determined as follows:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Rules against age discrimination.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) The rules stated in this paragraph are limited by the exceptions contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific rules.</E> A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contracting, licensing, or other arrangements, use age distinctions or take any other actions that have the effect, on the basis of age, of:</P>
                <P>(i) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(3) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Exceptions for normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity.</E> A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. <PRTPAGE P="761"/>An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:</P>
                <P>(1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and</P>
                <P>(2) The other characteristics must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and</P>
                <P>(3) The other characteristics can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and</P>
                <P>(4) The other characteristics are impractical to measure directly on an individual basis.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exceptions for reasonable factors other than age.</E> A recipient is permitted to take action otherwise prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section if the action is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or the achievement of a statutory objective.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Burden of proof.</E> The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within an exception described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.</P>
                <P>(e) For the purposes of paragraphs (b) and (c), <E T="03">normal operation</E> means the operation of a program or activity without significant changes that would impair its ability to meet its statutory objectives. <E T="03">Statutory objectives</E> means any purpose of a program or activity expressly stated in any Federal, State, or local statute adopted by an elected, general purpose legislative body.</P>
                <P>(f) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if a recipient operating a program provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Enforcement procedures.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) HUD may enforce the Act this regulation by:</P>

                <P>(1) Termination of a recipient's financial assistance from HUD under the program or activity involved, if the recipient has violated the Act or this part. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an Administrative Law Judge. If the financial assistance consists of a Community Development Block Grant, the requirements of section 109(b) of the <PRTPAGE P="764"/>Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5309, must also be satisfied before the termination of financial assistance. Cases settled in mediation or before hearing will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) Any other means authorized by law, including, but not limited to:</P>
                <P>(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or this part;</P>
                <P>(ii) Use of any requirement of, or referral to, any Federal, State or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.</P>
                <P>(b) Whenever the Secretary determines that a State or unit of general local government which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5301-5317, has failed to comply with requirements of the Age Discrimination Act or this part with respect to a program or activity funded in whole or in part with such assistance, he or she shall notify the Governor of such State or the chief executive officer of such unit of general local government of the noncompliance and shall request the Governor or chief executive officer to secure compliance. If within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, the Governor or chief executive officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, the Secretary is authorized to take the action specified in (a) of this section, exercise the powers and functions provided for in section 111(a) of the Housing and Community Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5311(a), or take such other action as may be provided by law.</P>
                <P>(c) HUD shall limit any termination under § 146.35 to the particular recipient and particular program or activity HUD finds to be in violation of this part. HUD shall not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from HUD.</P>
                <P>(d) HUD shall take no action under paragraph (a) of this section until:</P>
                <P>(1) The Secretary has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be achieved.</P>
                <P>(2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has submitted a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the Federal program or activity involved. A report shall be filed whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
                <P>(e)(1) The Secretary may defer the provision of new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when termination proceedings under this section are initiated.</P>
                <P>(2) New financial assistance from HUD includes all assistance for which HUD requires an application, approval, or submissions under the Community Development Block Grant program including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New financial assistance from HUD does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation for formula awards or assistance approved before the beginning of a hearing under this section.</P>
                <P>(3) HUD shall not impose a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under this section. HUD shall not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Secretary. HUD shall not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding that the recipient has violated that Act or this part.</P>

                <P>(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and HUD had made no finding with regard to the complaint; or</P>
                <P>(2) HUD issues any finding in favor of the recipient.</P>
                <P>(b) If HUD fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, HUD shall:</P>
                <P>(1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact;</P>
                <P>(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action for injunctive relief; and</P>
                <P>(3) Inform the complainant:</P>
                <P>(i) That he or she may bring a civil action only in a United States District Court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;</P>
                <P>(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;</P>
                <P>(iii) That before commencing the action, the complainant must give 30 days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary of HUD, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;</P>
                <P>(iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act, the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the action, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and</P>
                <P>(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.</P>

                <P>(a) Where the Secretary finds that a recipient has unlawfully discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any action that the Secretary may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over a subrecipient that has unlawfully discriminated, the Secretary may require both recipients to take remedial action.</P>
                <P>(b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.</P>
                <P>(c) If a recipient operating a program which serves the elderly or children in addition to persons of other ages provides special benefits to the elderly or children, the provision of those benefits shall be presumed to be voluntary affirmative action, provided that it does not have the effect of excluding otherwise eligible persons from participation in the program.</P>

                <P>(a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph and to the extent authorized by law, the Secretary may redisburse funds withheld or terminated under this part directly to an alternate recipient, including any public or non-profit private organization or agency, State or political subdivision of the State. Under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5301, funds withheld because of a reduction or withdrawal of a recipient's Community Development Block Grant must be reallocated in the succeeding fiscal year, in accordance with the applicable regulations governing that program.</P>
                <P>(b) The Secretary shall require the alternate recipient to demonstrate:</P>
                <P>(1) The ability to comply with the regulations; and</P>
                <P>(2) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute authorizing the program or activity.</P>

Any such request may be granted if the ALJ believes the proposed additional testimony may assist <PRTPAGE P="770"/>materially in elucidating factual matters at issue between the parties and will not expand the issues.</P>

                <P>(2) The burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as the party served. The party serving the interrogatory shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries. The specification shall include sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and identify the individual records from which the answer may be ascertained.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure at deposition.</E> Depositions may be taken before any disinterested person having power to administer oaths in the location where the deposition is to be taken. Each deponent shall be placed under oath or affirmation, and the other parties will have the right to cross-examine. The deponent may have counsel present during the deposition. The questions propounded and all answers and objections thereto shall be reduced to writing, read by or to and subscribed by the witness, and certified by the person before whom the deposition was taken.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> At the hearing, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice of the taking of the deposition, in accordance with the following provisions:</P>
                <P>(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness.</P>
                <P>(2) The deposition of an expert witness may be used by any party for any purpose, unless the ALJ rules that such use is unfair or in violation of due process.</P>
                <P>(3) The deposition of a party, or of anyone who at the time of the taking of the deposition was an officer, director, or duly authorized agent of a public or private corporation, partnership, or association that is a party, may be used by any other party for any purpose.</P>
                <P>(4) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the ALJ finds:</P>
                <P>(i) That the witness is dead;</P>
                <P>(ii) That the witness is out of the United States or more than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition;</P>
                <P>(iii) That the witness is unable to attend to testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment;</P>
                <P>(iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or</P>
                <P>(v) Whenever exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.</P>
                <P>(5) If a part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, any other party may require the party to introduce all of the deposition that is relevant to the part introduced. Any party may introduce any other part of the deposition.</P>
                <P>(6) Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use depositions previously taken. If a proceeding has been dismissed and another proceeding involving the same subject matter is later brought between the same parties or their representatives or successors in interest, all depositions lawfully taken in the former proceeding may be used in the latter proceeding.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Objections to admissibility.</E> Except as provided in this paragraph, objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part of a deposition for any reason that would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were present and testifying.</P>
                <P>(1) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the basis of the objection is one which might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</P>
                <P>(2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless reasonable objection is made at the taking of the deposition.</P>

                </P>
                <P>(1) Produce and/or permit the party, or a person acting on the party's behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents, or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things that contain or may lead to relevant information and that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served.</P>

                <P>(c) Within 15 days after service of the request, the party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response on the party submitting the request. The response shall state, with regard to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless there are objections, in which case the reasons for the objection shall be stated.</P>
                <P>(d) Upon motion of any party, when the mental or physical condition (including the blood group) of a party or of a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party, is in controversy, the presiding ALJ may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner or to produce for examination the person in the party's custody or legal control. The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown and upon notice to the person to be examined and to all parties and shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.

                <SUBJECT>Requests for admissions.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Any party may serve on any other party a written request for the admission of the truth of any matters relevant to the adjudication set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of application of law to fact, including the genuineness and authenticity of any documents described in or attached to the request.</P>
                <P>(b) Each matter for which an admission is requested is admitted unless, within 15 days after service of the request, or within such time as the ALJ allows, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a sworn written answer which:</P>
                <P>(1) Specifically denies, in whole or in part, the matter for which an admission is requested;</P>
                <P>(2) Sets forth in detail why the party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter; or</P>
                <P>(3) States an objection that the matter is privileged, irrelevant or otherwise improper in whole or in part.</P>
                <P>(c) An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless he/she/it states that he/she/it has made a reasonable inquiry and that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, him/her/it is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny.</P>
                <P>(d) The party requesting admissions may move for a determination of the sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the ALJ determines that an objection is justified, the ALJ shall order that an answer be served. If the ALJ determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this section, the ALJ may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.</P>
                <P>(e) Any matter admitted under this section is conclusively established unless, upon the motion of a party, the ALJ permits the withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Any admission made under this section is made for the purposes of the pending proceeding only, is not an admission by the party for any other purpose, and may not be used against the party in any other proceeding.</P>

                <P>(a) Upon motion of a party or a person from whom discovery is sought or in accordance with § 180.540(c), and for good cause shown, the ALJ may make appropriate orders to protect a party <PRTPAGE P="778"/>or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense as a result of the requested discovery request. The order may direct that:</P>
                <P>(1) The discovery may not be had;</P>
                <P>(2) The discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including at a designated time and place;</P>
                <P>(3) The discovery may be had by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</P>
                <P>(4) Certain matters may not be the subject of discovery, or the scope of discovery may be limited to certain matters;</P>
                <P>(5) Discovery may be conducted with no one present other than persons designated by the ALJ;</P>
                <P>(6) A trade secret or other confidential research, development or commercial information may not be disclosed, or may be disclosed only in a designated way; or</P>
                <P>(7) The party or other person from whom discovery is sought may file specified documents or information under seal to be opened as directed by the ALJ.</P>
                <P>(b) The ALJ may permit a party or other person from whom discovery is sought, who is seeking a protective order, to make all or part of the showing of good cause in camera. If such a showing is made, upon motion of the party or other person from whom discovery is sought, an in camera record of the proceedings may be made. If the ALJ enters a protective order, any in camera record of such showing shall be sealed and preserved and made available to the ALJ or, in the event of appeal, to the Secretary or a court.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Motion to compel discovery.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded, or a party upon whom a discovery request has been made fails to respond adequately, objects to a request, or fails to produce documents or other inspection as requested, the discovering party may move the ALJ for an order compelling discovery in accordance with the request. The motion shall:</P>
                <P>(1) State the nature of the request;</P>
                <P>(2) Set forth the response or objection of the deponent or party upon whom the request was served;</P>

                <P>(c) In ruling on a motion under this section, the ALJ may enter an order compelling a response in accordance with the request, may issue sanctions under paragraph (d) of this section, or may enter a protective order under § 180.535.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Sanctions.</E> If a party fails to provide or permit discovery, the ALJ may take such action as is just, including but not limited to the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Inferring that the admission, testimony, document, or other evidence would have been adverse to the party;</P>
                <P>(2) Ordering that, for purposes of the adjudication, the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order;</P>
                <P>(3) Prohibiting the party failing to comply with the order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon, documents or other evidence withheld;</P>
                <P>(4) Ordering that the party withholding discovery not introduce into evidence, or otherwise use in the hearing, information obtained in discovery;</P>
                <P>(5) Permitting the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence concerning the information sought;</P>
                <P>(6) Striking any appropriate part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party failing to comply with such order; or</P>
                <P>(7) Taking such other action as may be appropriate.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Subpoenas.</SUBJECT>

                <P>(a) This section governs the issuance of subpoenas in administrative proceedings under the Fair Housing Act. Except for time periods stated in the rules in this section, to the extent that this section conflicts with procedures for the issuance of subpoenas in civil actions in the United States District <PRTPAGE P="779"/>Court for the District in which the investigation of the discriminatory housing practice took place, the rules of the United States District Court apply.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of subpoena.</E> Upon the written request of a party, the presiding ALJ or other designated ALJ may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness for the purpose of giving testimony at a deposition or hearing and requiring the production of relevant books, papers, documents or tangible things.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Time of request.</E> Requests for subpoenas in aid of discovery must be submitted in time to permit the conclusion of discovery 15 days before the date scheduled for the hearing. If a request for subpoenas of a witness for testimony at a hearing is submitted three days or less before the hearing, the subpoena shall be issued at the discretion of the presiding ALJ, or other designated ALJ as appropriate.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Service.</E> A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service on a person shall be made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person and by tendering witness fees and mileage to that person. When the subpoena is issued on behalf of HUD, witness fees and mileage need not be tendered with the subpoena.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Amount of witness fees and mileage.</E> A witness summoned by a subpoena issued under this part is entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as a witness in proceedings in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena shall be paid by the party requesting the issuance of the subpoena, or where the ALJ determines that a party is unable to pay the fees, the fees shall be paid by HUD.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Motion to quash or limit subpoena.</E> Upon a motion by the person served with a subpoena or by a party, made within five days after service of the subpoena (but in any event not less than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance), the ALJ may:</P>
                <P>(1) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown; or</P>
                <P>(2) Condition denial of the motion upon the advancement, by the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued, of the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books, papers or documents. Where circumstances require, the ALJ may act upon such a motion at any time after a copy of the motion has been served upon the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to comply with subpoena.</E> If a person fails to comply with a subpoena issued under this section, the party requesting the subpoena may refer the matter to the Attorney General for enforcement in appropriate proceedings under 42 U.S.C. 3614(c).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Assessing civil penalties for Fair Housing Act cases.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Amounts.</E> The ALJ may assess a civil penalty against any respondent under § 180.670(b)(3) for each separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) that the respondent committed, each civil penalty in an amount not to exceed:</P>
                <P>(1) $21,039, if the respondent has not been adjudged in any administrative hearing or civil action permitted under the Fair Housing Act or any state or local fair housing law, or in any licensing or regulatory proceeding conducted by a federal, state, or local governmental agency, to have committed any prior discriminatory housing practice.</P>
                <P>(2) $52,596, if the respondent has been adjudged in any administrative hearing or civil action permitted under the Fair Housing Act, or under any state or local fair housing law, or in any licensing or regulatory proceeding conducted by a federal, state, or local government agency, to have committed one other discriminatory housing practice and the adjudication was made during the 5-year period preceding the date of filing of the charge.</P>
                <P>(3) $105,194, if the respondent has been adjudged in any administrative hearings or civil actions permitted under the Fair Housing Act, or under any state or local fair housing law, or in any licensing or regulatory proceeding conducted by a federal, state, or local government agency, to have committed two or more discriminatory housing practices and the adjudications were made during the 7-year period preceding the date of filing of the charge.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice.</E> A separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice is a single, continuous uninterrupted transaction or occurrence that violates section 804, 805, 806 or 818 of the Fair Housing Act. Even if such a transaction or occurrence violates more than one provision of the Fair <PRTPAGE P="783"/>Housing Act, violates a provision more than once, or violates the fair housing rights of more than one person, it constitutes only one separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Factors for consideration by ALJ.</E> (1) In determining the amount of the civil penalty to be assessed against any respondent for each separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice the respondent committed, the ALJ shall consider the following six (6) factors:</P>
                <P>(i) Whether that respondent has previously been adjudged to have committed unlawful housing discrimination;</P>
                <P>(ii) That respondent's financial resources;</P>
                <P>(iii) The nature and circumstances of the violation;</P>
                <P>(iv) The degree of that respondent's culpability;</P>
                <P>(v) The goal of deterrence; and</P>
                <P>(vi) Other matters as justice may require.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Where the ALJ finds any respondent to have committed a housing-related hate act, the ALJ shall take this fact into account in favor of imposing a maximum civil penalty under the factors listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">housing-related hate act</E> means any act that constitutes a discriminatory housing practice under section 818 of the Fair Housing Act and which constitutes or is accompanied or characterized by actual violence, assault, bodily harm, and/or harm to property; intimidation or coercion that has such elements; or the threat or commission of any action intended to assist or be a part of any such act.</P>
                <P>(iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require an ALJ to assess any amount less than a maximum civil penalty in a non-hate act case, where the ALJ finds that the factors listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section warrant the assessment of a maximum civil penalty.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Persons previously adjudged to have committed a discriminatory housing practice.</E> If the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that is the subject of the charge were committed by the same natural person who has previously been adjudged, in any administrative proceeding or civil action, to have committed acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice, the time periods in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section do not apply.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Multiple discriminatory housing practices committed by the same respondent; multiple respondents.</E> (1) In a proceeding where a respondent has been determined to have engaged in, or is about to engage in, more than one separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice, a separate civil penalty may be assessed against the respondent for each separate and distinct discriminatory housing practice.</P>
                <P>(2) In a proceeding involving two or more respondents who have been determined to have engaged in, or are about to engage in, one or more discriminatory housing practices, one or more civil penalties, as provided under this section, may be assessed against each respondent.</P>
