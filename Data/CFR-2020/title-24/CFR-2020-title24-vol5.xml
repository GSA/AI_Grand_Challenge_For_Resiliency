      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope of this part and applicability of other HUD regulations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This part contains the regulations of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) that implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552). It informs the public how to request records and information from the OIG and explains the procedure to use if a request is denied. Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with 24 CFR part 2003 as well as this part. Requests for documents made by subpoena or other demands of courts or other authorities are governed by procedures contained in part 2004 of this chapter. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability of HUD's FOIA regulations.</E> In addition to the regulations in this part, §§ 15.2 and 15.106 of this title apply to the production or disclosure of information in the possession of the OIG, except as limited in paragraph (c) of this section or otherwise expressly stated in this part.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Limited applicability of §§ 15.2 and 15.106 of this title.</E> The OIG has different people and entities involved in the FOIA process than those defined in § 15.2 and these people and entities are specifically identified in this part. For purposes of this part, when the words “HUD” or “Department” are used in § 15.2 or § 15.106, the term means the OIG. The OIG will follow the fee schedule at § 15.106 except as otherwise provided in this part. Where § 15.106 references § 15.103, the OIG reference in this part is § 2002.15.</P>

            <SUBJECT>OIG's overall policy concerning disclosable records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The OIG will administer its FOIA program with a presumption of openness. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court. The OIG will fully and responsibly disclose its identifiable records and information consistent with competing public interests, such as national security, personal privacy, grand jury and investigative secrecy, complainant confidentiality, and agency deliberative process, as are recognized by FOIA and other Federal statutes. The OIG will apply the FOIA exemptions if release could foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. Release of records will be made as promptly as possible.</P>

            <P>(b) The OIG FOIA Public Liaison is the Deputy Counsel to the Inspector General. Requesters who have questions or comments concerning their FOIA request may contact the FOIA Public Liaison at 202-708-1613, or through the FOIA email at <E T="03">FOIARequests@hudoig.gov.</E>

            <SECTNO>§ 2002.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>How to make a request for OIG records; records produced.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Any request for OIG records must be made in writing. The easiest way to make a FOIA request is electronically through our public website at <E T="03">www.hudoig.gov.</E> A request may also be <PRTPAGE P="10"/>made by submitting the written request to The Office of Inspector General; Department of Housing and Urban Development; 451 Seventh Street SW, Suite 8260, Washington, DC 20410. The envelope should indicate it is a FOIA request. A request for OIG records may also be made in person during normal business hours at any office where OIG employees are permanently stationed.</P>
            <P>(b) Each request must reasonably describe the desired record, including the title or name, author, subject matter, and number or date, where possible, so that the record may be identified and located. The more specific the FOIA request for records, the more likely OIG officials will be able to locate the records requested. The request should also include the name, address and telephone number of the requester, the fee category that the requester believes applies to the request, and the form or format in which the requester would like the desired record to be reproduced, if the requester has a preference. In order to enable the OIG to comply with the time limitations set forth in § 2002.15, both the envelope containing a written request and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request.</P>
            <P>(c) The request must be accompanied by the fee or an offer to pay the fee as determined in § 15.106 of this title and § 2002.13.</P>
            <P>(d) The OIG may require information verifying the requester's identity, if the requester requests agency records pertaining to the requester, a minor, or an individual who is legally incompetent. Failure to provide the information when requested will result in the request being found insufficient and closed. It will not prevent the future refiling of the request.</P>

            <P>(e) Duplication of available records will be made as promptly as possible. Such duplication can take the form of paper copy, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> electronic documents on CD, DVD, flash drive, etc.). Records that are published or available for sale will not be reproduced.</P>
            <P>(f) The OIG shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.</P>
            <P>(g) If the requester makes a request for expedited processing, the request must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the request. The requester should also include a statement certifying the truth of the circumstances supporting the requester's compelling need. Requests for expedited processing that simply recite the statutory language are generally not granted.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 2002.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>OIG processing of requests, multi-tracking, and expedited processing.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Tracking number.</E> FOIA requests will be logged in the order that they are received and be assigned a tracking number, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. A requester should use the tracking number to identify his or her request when contacting the FOIA office for any reason. An acknowledgement of receipt of the request, with the assigned tracking number, will be sent to the requester by the FOIA office.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multi-track processing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Types of tracks.</E> For requests that do not qualify for expedited processing, the OIG places each request in one of two tracks, simple or complex, based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. In doing so, the OIG will consider whether the request involves the processing of voluminous documents or responsive documents from more than one organizational unit. Within each track, the OIG processes requests in the order in which they are received.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> Requests for audit work papers are considered complex requests and generally qualify as an unusual circumstance under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), taking longer than 20 working days to process. Requests for “all” specified records over a span of time, if they are accepted as reasonably describing a specific group of records, are considered complex requests and usually qualify as an unusual circumstance under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), taking longer than 20 working days to process. Requesters who make requests qualifying as unusual circumstances will be offered an <PRTPAGE P="11"/>opportunity to narrow the scope of their request or arrange for an alternative time period.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Misdirected requests.</E> For requests that have been sent to the wrong office, the OIG will assign the request within each track using the earlier of either:</P>
            <P>(i) The date on which the request was referred to the appropriate office; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The end of the 10 working-day period in which the request should have been referred to the appropriate office.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) The OIG may take your request or appeal out of normal order if the OIG determines that you have a compelling need for the records or in other cases as determined by the OIG. Any requester may ask for expedited processing at any time. If expedited processing is requested, the OIG will notify the requester within 10 working days whether it will grant expedited processing.</P>
            <P>(2) The OIG will grant requests for expedited processing if it finds a compelling need under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E). Evidence of a compelling need by a person making a request for expedited processing must be made in a statement certified by such person to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief. A compelling need exists if:</P>
            <P>(i) Your failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
            <P>(ii) You are primarily engaged in disseminating information and there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity; or</P>
            <P>(iii) Your failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could result in the loss of substantial due process rights.</P>
            <P>(3) If the OIG grants the request for expedited processing, the OIG will give the request priority and will process it as soon as practicable.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Proactive disclosures of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) You may review records that section 552(a)(2) of FOIA requires the OIG to make available to the public in the electronic reading rooms identified in paragraph (b) of this section. That is the preferable method; however, you may also ask to review those documents that are in hardcopy at the Headquarters offices at HUD's Library, 451 Seventh Street SW, Suite 8141, Washington, DC 20410. This request should be coordinated through Office of Legal Counsel, Office of Inspector General, Suite 8254. Local offices may coordinate local requests for hardcopy reviews.</P>

            <P>(b) As required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the OIG makes records created on or after November 1, 1996, available through its Electronic FOIA Reading Room, located at <E T="03">https://www.hudoig.gov/foia.</E> These records include:</P>
            <P>(1) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format that have been released to any person under this part: and</P>
            <P>(i) Because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines that the records have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Have been requested three or more times.</P>
            <P>(2) Report for the preceding fiscal year submitted to the U.S. Attorney General and the Director of the Office of Government Information Services as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(e) and the raw statistical data used in each report. This report will be made available:</P>
            <P>(i) Without charge, license, or registration requirement;</P>
            <P>(ii) In an aggregated, searchable format; and</P>
            <P>(iii) In a format that may be downloaded in bulk.</P>

            <P>(c) The OIG also makes other documents, such as audits and semiannual reports, available to the public at <E T="03">https://www.hudoig.gov/.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Agency review of records and aggregating requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for the time the OIG spends reviewing records to determine whether the records are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges will be assessed only for the initial review; <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review undertaken the first time the OIG reviews a <PRTPAGE P="12"/>particular record or portion of a record to apply an exemption. The OIG will not charge for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review would be properly assessable. Review time will be assessed at the same rates established for search time in §§ 2002.13 and 15.106 of this title.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> (1) The OIG may aggregate multiple requests in cases where unusual circumstances exist and the OIG determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) Certain requests from the same requester or from a group of requesters acting in concert actually constitute a single request; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The requests involve clearly related matters.</P>
            <P>(2) Aggregation of requests for this purpose will be conducted independent of aggregation of requests for fee purposes under § 15.106(h) of this title.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fee schedule, advance payment, interest charges, and waiving or reducing fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The OIG will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with § 15.106 of this title, except where those provisions conflict with provisions of this part; more specifically, where § 15.106 references § 15.103 of this title replace such reference with § 2002.15.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Time limitations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Upon receipt of a request for records, the appropriate Assistant Inspector General or an appointed designee will generally make a determination whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days. The Assistant Inspector General or designee will immediately notify the requestor in writing of the determination and the reason(s) for such determination and the right of the person to request assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison. The 20-day period will begin on the day the request is received by the OIG, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is received by any component designated to receive FOIA requests, and after any fees or advance payment of fees under § 2002.13 has been made.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of responsive records.</E> In determining which records are responsive to a request, an agency ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the agency must inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> Under unusual circumstances, as specified in this paragraph (c), the OIG may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request. In such circumstances, the OIG will provide the requester with written notice setting forth the unusual circumstances for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. This date will not exceed 10 working days beyond the general time established in paragraph (a) of this section. If processing a request would require more than 10 working days beyond the general time limit established in paragraph (a) of this section, the OIG will offer the requester an opportunity to reduce or limit the scope of the request in order to allow the OIG to process it within the extra 10-day working period or arrange an alternative time period within which the FOIA request will be processed. To aid the requester, the OIG shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the OIG, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. Unusual circumstances mean that there is a need:</P>
            <P>(1) To search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>

            <P>(2) To search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request (<E T="03">e.g.</E> audit work papers); or</P>

            <P>(3) For consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, <PRTPAGE P="13"/>with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more offices of the Office of Inspector General having a substantial interest in the subject matter of the request.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority to release records or duplications.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Any Assistant Inspector General or an appointed designee is authorized to release any record (or duplication) pertaining to activities for which he or she has primary responsibility, unless disclosure is clearly inappropriate under this part. No authorized person may release records for which another officer has primary responsibility without the consent of the officer or his or her designee.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority to deny requests for records and form of denial, exemptions, and exclusions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Process for denying requests.</E> An Assistant Inspector General or the Counsel to the Inspector General, or their designees, may deny a request for a record. Any denial will:</P>
            <P>(1) Be in writing;</P>
            <P>(2) State simply the reasons for the denial;</P>
            <P>(3) Provide an estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, when appropriate, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;</P>
            <P>(4) Identify the person(s) responsible for the denial by name and title;</P>
            <P>(5) Provide notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the Deputy Inspector General, within a period determined by the head of the agency that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination, consistent with § 2002.23; and</P>
            <P>(6) Provide notice of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison of the agency or the Office of Government Information Services.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Denying requests generally.</E> The OIG shall withhold information only if the OIG reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption as provided in this section, or disclosure is prohibited by law. The OIG will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever the OIG determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this section requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law or otherwise exempted from disclosure as provided in this section.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">FOIA exemptions.</E> The FOIA contains nine exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorize agencies to withhold various records from disclosure, and two exclusions to the statute that may be used by the OIG. With regard to the records normally requested, the OIG generally applies the exemptions and exclusions as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Classified documents.</E> Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. The OIG seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, the OIG will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. The OIG may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Internal agency rules and practices.</E> Exemption 2 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)) protects records relating to internal personnel rules and practices.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Information prohibited from disclosure by another statute.</E> Exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)) protects information that is prohibited from disclosure by another Federal law. Some investigative records contain information that could reveal grand jury proceedings, which are protected from disclosure by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). Section 7 of the Inspector General Act of 1978 prohibits the OIG from disclosing the identity of employees who make protected disclosures. The OIG generally will not disclose competitive <PRTPAGE P="14"/>proposals prior to contract award, competitive proposals that are not set forth or incorporated by reference into the awarded contract, (see 41 U.S.C. 4702), or, during the selection process, any covered selection information regarding such selection, either directly or indirectly (see 42 U.S.C. 3537a).</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Commercial or financial information.</E> Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that is privileged and confidential. The OIG frequently obtains this information through its audits. The OIG will process the release of this category of information pursuant to Executive Order 12600 and give notice to the affected business and an opportunity for the business to present evidence of its confidentiality claim. If the OIG is sued by a requester under the FOIA for nondisclosure of confidential business information, the OIG expects the affected business to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in defending such a decision.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Certain interagency or intra-agency communications.</E> Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) protects interagency or intra-agency communications that are protected by legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, or communications reflecting the agency's deliberative process. These communications may include communications with the Department of Justice and with HUD. The deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Personal privacy.</E> Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) protects information involving matters of personal privacy. This information may be found in personnel, medical, and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of persons identified in audits or complaints generally will not be disclosed. The OIG has learned through experience that some of its employees (<E T="03">i.e.</E> Hotline employees) will be harassed if their identities are known, and the OIG will protect the identities of these employees. As a law enforcement agency, the OIG finds individuals generally have a heightened privacy interest for not having their identities associated with the OIG.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Law enforcement records.</E> Exemption 7 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)) protects certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption protects records where the production could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The protection of this exemption also encompasses, but is not limited to, information in law enforcement files that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; the names of confidential informants; and techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations, or guidelines for law enforcement investigations if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. It is the policy of the OIG in responding to all FOIA requests for investigative records pertaining to specifically named individuals to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of such records. Lacking the subject individuals consent, proof of death, an official acknowledgement of an investigation, or an overriding public interest, even to acknowledge the existence of such records could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Supervision of financial institutions.</E> Exemption 8 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)) protects information relating to the supervision of financial institutions. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Wells.</E> Exemption 9 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)) protects geological information on wells. It is unlikely that the OIG will have these documents.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">FOIA exclusion.</E> Some law enforcement records are excluded from the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(1) permits a law enforcement agency to exclude a document from the FOIA if there is reason to believe that:</P>
            <P>(1) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and</P>

            <P>(2) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, in which case the agency <PRTPAGE P="15"/>may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Section 552(c)(2) of FOIA allows the exclusion of informant records, unless the existence of the informant has been officially confirmed.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative review.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Review is available only from a written determination denying a request for a record and only if a written request for review is filed within 90 days after issuance of the written determination. If mailed, the requester's letter of appeal must be postmarked within 90 calendar days of the date of the letter of determination. If the letter of appeal is transmitted electronically or by a means other than the United States Postal Service, it must be received in the appropriate office by the close of business on the 90th calendar day after the date of the letter of determination. Before seeking court review of an adverse determination, a requester must exhaust their administrative remedies under this section.</P>

            <P>(b) A review may be initiated by sending a request for review to the Office of Inspector General; Department of Housing and Urban Development; 451 Seventh Street SW, Room 8256, Washington, DC 20410 or to <E T="03">FOIArequests@hudoig.gov.</E> In order to enable the OIG to comply with the time limitations set forth in § 2002.17, both the envelope containing the request for review and the letter itself should clearly indicate that the subject is a Freedom of Information Act request for review. Each request for review must contain the following:</P>
            <P>(1) A copy of the original request;</P>
            <P>(2) A copy of the written denial; and</P>
            <P>(3) A statement of the circumstances, reasons, or arguments advanced in support of disclosure of the original records requested.</P>
            <P>(c) Review will be made promptly by the Deputy Inspector General, or designee, on the basis of the written record. The OIG will decide an appeal of a denial of a request to expedite processing of a FOIA request within 10 working days of receipt of the appeal. The OIG will make a determination on all other appeals within 20 working days of receipt, unless unusual circumstances require the OIG to extend the time for an additional 10 working days.</P>
            <P>(d) The time of receipt for processing of a request is the time it is received by the Inspector General. If a request is misdirected by the requester and is received by one other than the Inspector General, the OIG official who receives the request will forward it promptly to the Inspector General and will advise the requester about the delayed time of receipt.</P>
            <P>(e) The decision after review will be in writing, will constitute final agency action on the request, and, if the denial of the request for records is in full or in part upheld, the Inspector General will notify the person making the request of his or her right to seek judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).</P>
            <P>(f) Adverse decisions will include the name and contact information of dispute resolution services that offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation.</P>

            <P>(a) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that individual which is not contained in an OIG system of records will be considered to be a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and will be processed under 24 CFR part 2002.</P>
            <P>(b) A request from an individual for an OIG record about that individual which is contained in an OIG system of records will be processed under both the Privacy Act and the FOIA in order to ensure maximum access under both statutes. This practice will be undertaken regardless of how an individual characterizes the request.</P>

            <P>(a) Access by an individual to a record about that individual which is contained in an OIG system of records will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:</P>
            <P>(1) The record was compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding; or the record is subject to a Privacy Act exemption under § 2003.8 or § 2003.9 of this part; and</P>

            <SUBJECT>Authority to make law enforcement-related requests for records maintained by other agencies.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Inspector General is authorized by written delegation from the Secretary of HUD and under the Inspector General Act to make written requests under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7) for transfer of records maintained by other agencies which are necessary to carry out an authorized law enforcement activity under the Inspector General Act.</P>
            <P>(b) The Inspector General delegates the authority under paragraph (a) of this section to the following OIG officials:</P>
            <P>(1) Deputy Inspector General;</P>
            <P>(2) Assistant Inspector General for Audit;</P>

            <SUBJECT>General exemptions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The systems of records entitled “Investigative Files of the Office of Inspector General,” “Hotline Complaint Files of the Office of Inspector General,” “Name Indices System of the Office of Inspector General,” and “AutoInvestigation of the Office of Inspector General” consist, in part, of information compiled by the OIG for the purpose of criminal law enforcement investigations. Therefore, to the extent that information in these systems falls within the scope of exemption (j)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), these systems of records are exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) From subsection (c)(3), because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who is the subject of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.</P>
            <P>(2) From subsection (d)(1), because release of investigative records to an individual who is the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.</P>
            <P>(3) From subsection (d)(2), because amendment or correction of investigative records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the OIG to continuously retrograde its investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.</P>

            <P>(4) From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of an investigation. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, <PRTPAGE P="18"/>the OIG may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the OIG should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an investigation, information may be provided to the OIG which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.</P>
            <P>(5) From subsection (e)(2), because in a law enforcement investigation it is usually counterproductive to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject thereof. It is not always feasible to rely upon the subject of an investigation as a source for information which may implicate him or her in illegal activities. In addition, collecting information directly from the subject could seriously compromise an investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could provide the subject with an opportunity to conceal criminal activities, or intimidate potential sources, in order to avoid apprehension.</P>
            <P>(6) From subsection (e)(3), because providing such notice to the subject of an investigation, or to other individual sources, could seriously compromise the investigation by prematurely revealing its nature and scope, or could inhibit cooperation, permit the subject to evade apprehension, or cause interference with undercover activities.</P>

Therefore, to the extent that information in these systems fall within the coverage of exemption (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), these systems of records are exempt from the requirements of subsection (d)(1), because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.</P>

              <P>The Counsel or Inspector General, in their discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to a demand or request.

              <P>(b) OIG has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;</P>
              <P>(c) Allowing such testimony or production of records would assist or hinder OIG in performing its statutory duties or use OIG resources where responding to the request will interfere with the ability of OIG employees to do their work;</P>
              <P>(d) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;</P>
              <P>(e) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose;</P>
              <P>(f) Disclosure would violate or be inconsistent with a statute, Executive Order, or regulation;</P>
              <P>(g) Disclosure would reveal confidential or privileged information, trade secrets, or similar, confidential commercial, or financial information;</P>
              <P>(h) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceedings, or compromise constitutional rights;</P>
              <P>(i) Disclosure would result in OIG appearing to favor one litigant over another;</P>
              <P>(j) Disclosure relates to documents that were produced by another agency;</P>
              <P>(k) The demand or request is in conformance with all other applicable rules;</P>
              <P>(l) The demand or request is sufficiently specific to be answered; and</P>

              <P>You must comply with the following requirements whenever you issue demands or requests to an OIG employee for official records and information or testimony.</P>
              <P>(a) Your request must be in writing and must be submitted to the Counsel. If you serve a subpoena on OIG or on an OIG employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination from the Counsel, OIG will oppose the subpoena on grounds that your request was not submitted in accordance with this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) Your written request must contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;</P>
              <P>(2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document sufficient to show relevance;</P>
              <P>(3) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;</P>
              <P>(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain any confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on OIG to produce the records or provide testimony;</P>
              <P>(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than an OIG employee, such as a retained expert;</P>
              <P>(6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;</P>
              <P>(7) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested records or testimony;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties will require with each OIG employee for time spent by the employee to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.</P>
              <P>(c) The OIG reserves the right to require additional information to complete your request where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) Your request should be submitted at least 30 days before the date that records or testimony are required. Requests submitted less than 30 days before records or testimony are required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.</P>
              <P>(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with your request.</P>

              <P>(a) The Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure.

              <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Generally.</E> The Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to OIG.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Fees for records.</E> Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those <PRTPAGE P="24"/>charged by OIG in its Freedom of Information Act Regulations at 24 CFR part 2002.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Witness fees.</E> Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of fees.</E> You must pay any applicable witness fees for current OIG employees and any records certification fees by submitting to the Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony by former OIG employees, you must pay applicable fees directly to the former employee in accordance with applicable statutes.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fees.</E> The Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony or production of records. Additionally, fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Certification label</E> means the approved form of certification by the manufacturer that, under § 3280.8, is permanently affixed to each transportable section of each manufactured home manufactured for sale in the United States.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Dwelling unit</E> means one or more habitable rooms which are designed to be occupied by one family with facilities for living, sleeping, cooking and eating.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Equipment</E> includes materials, appliances, devices, fixtures, fittings or accessories both in the construction of, and in the fire safety, plumbing, heat-producing and electrical systems of manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard</E> means a reasonable standard for the construction, design, and performance of a manufactured home which meets the needs of the public including the need for quality, durability, and safety.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Installations</E> means all arrangements and methods of construction, as well as fire safety, plumbing, heat-producing and electrical systems used in manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Labeled</E> means a label, symbol or other identifying mark of a nationally recognized testing laboratory, inspection agency, or other organization concerned with product evaluation that maintains periodic inspection of production of labeled equipment or materials, and by whose labeling is indicated compliance with nationally recognized standards or tests to determine suitable usage in a specified manner.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Length of a manufactured home</E> means its largest overall length in the traveling mode, including cabinets and other projections which contain interior space. Length does not include bay <PRTPAGE P="31"/>windows, roof projections, overhangs, or eaves under which there is no interior space, nor does it include drawbars, couplings or hitches.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Listed or certified</E> means included in a list published by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, inspection agency, or other organization concerned with product evaluation that maintains periodic inspection of production of listed equipment or materials, and whose listing states either that the equipment or material meets nationally recognized standards or has been tested and found suitable for use in a specified manner.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Manufacturer</E> means any person engaged in manufacturing or assembling manufactured homes, including any person engaged in importing manufactured homes for resale.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Manufactured home</E> means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is 8 body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length or which when erected on-site is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained in the structure. This term includes all structures that meet the above requirements except the size requirements and with respect to which the manufacturer voluntarily files a certification pursuant to § 3282.13 of this chapter and complies with the construction and safety standards set forth in this part 3280. The term does not include any self-propelled recreational vehicle. Calculations used to determine the number of square feet in a structure will include the total of square feet for each transportable section comprising the completed structure and will be based on the structure's exterior dimensions measured at the largest horizontal projections when erected on site. These dimensions will include all expandable rooms, cabinets, and other projections containing interior space, but do not include bay windows.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Lighting.</E> Each habitable room shall be provided with exterior windows and/or doors having a total glazed area of not less than 8 percent of the gross floor area.</P>

              <P>(1) Kitchens, bathrooms, toilet compartments, laundry areas, and utility <PRTPAGE P="44"/>rooms may be provided with artificial light in place of windows.</P>
              <P>(2) Rooms and areas may be combined for the purpose of providing the required natural lighting provided that at least one half of the common wall area is open and unobstructed, and the open area is at least equal to 10 percent of the combined floor area or 25 square feet whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Whole-house ventilation.</E> Each manufactured home must be provided with whole-house ventilation having a minimum capacity of 0.035 ft<SU>3</SU>/min/ft<SU>2</SU> of interior floor space or its hourly average equivalent. This ventilation capacity must be in addition to any openable window area. In no case shall the installed ventilation capacity of the system be less than 50 cfm nor more than 90 cfm. The following criteria must be adhered to:</P>
              <P>(1) The ventilation capacity must be provided by a mechanical system or a combination passive and mechanical system. The ventilation system or provisions for ventilation must not create a positive pressure in Uo Value Zone 2 and Zone 3 or a negative pressure condition in Uo Value Zone 1. Mechanical systems must be balanced. Combination passive and mechanical systems must have adequately sized inlets or exhaust to release any unbalanced pressure. Temporary pressure imbalances due to gusting or high winds are permitted.</P>
              <P>(2) The ventilation system or provisions for ventilation must exchange air directly with the exterior of the home, except the ventilation system, or provisions for ventilation must not draw or expel air with the space underneath the home. The ventilation system or provisions for ventilation must not draw or expel air into the floor, wall, or ceiling/roof systems, even if those systems are vented. The ventilation system must be designed to ensure that outside air is distributed to all bedrooms and main living areas. The combined use of undercut doors or transom grills connecting those areas to the room where the mechanical system is located is deemed to meet this requirement.</P>
              <P>(3) The ventilation system or a portion of the system is permitted to be integral with the home's heating or cooling system. The system must be capable of operating independently of the heating or cooling modes. A ventilation system that is integral with the heating or cooling system is to be listed as part of the heating and cooling system or listed as suitable for use with that system.</P>
              <P>(4) A mechanical ventilation system, or mechanical portion thereof, must be provided with a manual control, and must be permitted to be provided with automatic timers or humidistats.</P>
              <P>(5) A whole-house ventilation label must be attached to the whole-house ventilation control, must be permanent, and must state: “WHOLE-HOUSE VENTILATION”.</P>
              <P>(6) Instructions for correctly operating and maintaining whole-house ventilation systems must be included with the homeowner's manual. The instructions must encourage occupants to operate these systems whenever the home is occupied, and must refer to the labeled whole-house ventilation control.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Additional ventilation.</E> (1) At least half of the minimum required glazed area in paragraph (a) of this section shall be openable directly to the outside of the manufactured home for unobstructed ventilation. These same ventilation requirements apply to rooms combined in accordance with § 3280.103(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) Kitchens shall be provided with a mechanical ventilation system that is capable of exhausting 100 cfm to the outside of the home. The exhaust fan shall be located as close as possible to the range or cook top, but in no case farther than 10 feet horizontally from the range or cook top.</P>
              <P>(3) Each bathroom and separate toilet compartment shall be provided with a mechanical ventilation system capable of exhausting 50 cfm to the outside of the home. A separate toilet compartment may be provided with 1.5 square feet of openable glazed area in place of mechanical ventilation, except in Uo value Zone 3.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Provisions for support and anchoring systems.</E> Each manufactured home shall have provisions for support/anchoring or foundation systems that, when properly designed and installed, will resist overturning and lateral movement (sliding) of the manufactured home as imposed by the respective design loads. For Wind Zone I, the design wind loads to be used for calculating resistance to overturning and lateral movement shall be the simultaneous application of the wind loads indicated in § 3280.305(c)(1)(i), increased by a factor of 1.5. The 1.5 factor of safety for Wind Zone I is also to be applied simultaneously to both the vertical building projection, as horizontal wind load, and across the surface of the full roof structure, as uplift loading. For Wind Zones II and III, the resistance shall be determined by the simultaneous application of the horizontal drag and uplift wind loads, in accordance with § 3280.305(c)(1)(ii). The basic allowable stresses of materials required to resist overturning and lateral movement shall not be increased in the design and proportioning of these members. No additional shape or location factors need to be applied in the design of the tiedown system. The dead load of the structure may be used to resist these wind loading effects in all Wind Zones.<PRTPAGE P="66"/>
              </P>

The manufacturer must identify by paint, label, decal stencil, or other means: the location of each column support pier location required along the marriage line(s) of multi-section manufactured homes; each pier location required along the perimeter of the home; each required shear wall pier support; and any other special pier support locations specified in the manufacturer's printed instructions. Such identifications must be visible after the home is installed. The manufacturer must provide drawings and specifications, certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, that indicate at least one acceptable system of anchoring, including the details or required straps or cables, their end connections, and all other devices needed to transfer the wind loads from the manufactured home to an anchoring or foundation system.</P>
              <P>(2) For anchoring systems, the instructions shall indicate:</P>
              <P>(i) The minimum anchor capacity required;</P>
              <P>(ii) That anchors should be certified by a professional engineer, architect, or a nationally recognized testing laboratory as to their resistance, based on the maximum angle of diagonal tie and/or vertical tie loading (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section) and angle of anchor installation, and type of soil in which the anchor is to be installed;</P>
              <P>(iii) That ground anchors are to be embedded below the frost line, unless the foundation system is frost-protected in accordance with §§ 3285.312(b) and 3285.404 of the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iv) That ground anchors must be installed to their full depth, and stabilizer plates must be installed in accordance with the ground anchor listing or certification to provide required resistance to overturning and sliding.</P>
              <P>(v) That anchoring equipment should be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect to resist these specified forces in accordance with testing procedures in ASTM D3953-97, Standard Specification for Strapping, Flat Steel and Seals (incorporated by reference, see § 3280.4).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Design criteria.</E> The provisions made for anchoring systems shall be based on the following design criteria for manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>(1) The minimum number of ties provided per side of each home shall resist design wind loads required in § 3280.305(c)(1).</P>
              <P>(2) Ties shall be as evenly spaced as practicable along the length of the manufactured home, with not more than two (2) feet open-end spacing on each end.</P>
              <P>(3) Vertical ties or straps shall be positioned at studs. Where a vertical tie and a diagonal tie are located at the same place, both ties may be connected to a single anchor, provided that the anchor used is capable of carrying both loadings, simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(4) Add-on sections of expandable manufactured homes shall have provisions for vertical ties at the exposed ends.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirements for ties.</E> Manufactured homes in Wind Zone I require only diagonal ties. These ties shall be placed along the main frame and below the outer side walls.

              <SUBJECT>Test procedures for roof trusses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Roof load tests.</E> This section provides the roof truss test procedure for vertical loading conditions. Where roof trusses act as support for other members, have eave or cornice projections, or support concentrated loads, roof trusses must also be tested for those conditions. These test procedures are required for new truss designs in all three wind zones and for existing truss designs used in Wind Zones II and III.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General.</E> Trusses must be tested in a truss test fixture that replicates the design loads, and actual support points, and does not restrain horizontal movement. When tested singly or in groups of two or more trusses, trusses shall be mounted on supports and positioned as intended to be installed in the manufactured home in order to give the required clear span distance (L) and eave or cornice distance (Lo), if applicable, as specified in the design.</P>
              <P>(l) When trusses are tested singly, trusses shall be positioned in a test fixture, with supports properly located and the roof loads evenly applied. See Figure 3280.402(b)(1).</P>

              <P>(2) When tested in groups of two or more, the top chords are permitted to be sheathed with nominal 1/4-inch × 12-inch plywood strips. The plywood strips shall be at least long enough to cover the top chords of the trusses at the designated design truss spacing. Adjacent plywood strips shall be separated by at least 1/8-inch. The plywood strips shall be nailed with 4d nails or equivalent staples no closer than 8 inches on center along the top chord. The bottom chords of the adjacent trusses shall be permitted to be one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Unbraced; or<PRTPAGE P="70"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Laterally braced together (not cross-braced) with 1-inch × 2-inch stripping no closer than 24 inches on center, nailed with only one 8d nail at each truss. See Figure 3280.402(b)(2).</P>

              </GPH>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Measuring and loading methods.</E> Deflections must be measured at the free end of an eave or cornice projection and at least at the truss mid-span and quarter points. Scissors or other unique truss configurations are to be measured at as many additional bottom chord panel points as necessary to obtain an accurate representation of the deflected shape of the truss so as to be able to locate and record the point(s) of maximum deflection. Deflections must be read and recorded relative to a fixed reference datum. Deflections must be read and recorded to the nearest 1/32-inch. Dead load must be applied to the top and bottom chord, and live load must be applied to the top chord through a suitable hydraulic, pneumatic, or mechanical system or weights to simulate design loads. Load unit weights for uniformly distributed top chord loads must be separated so that arch action does not occur and be spaced not more than 12 inches on center so as to simulate uniform loading. Bottom chord loading must be spaced as uniformly as practical. Truss gravity loads must be calculated based on the overall truss length (horizontal projection), including eave or cornice projections.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Testing procedures.</E> Either the testing method in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section may be used, however, the testing method in paragraph (d)(3) of this section must be used, to test trusses to establish compliance with the provisions of these standards.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Proof load truss test procedure.</E> At least three average quality/consecutively tested trusses must pass all requirements of the test, for initial qualification of the truss design. All tests for initial qualification of the truss designs evaluated by this procedure must be certified by a Registered Engineer or Architect, or by a nationally recognized testing laboratory. An in-house quality control and follow-up testing program (see paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section) must be approved prior to entering production of any truss design evaluated by this procedure.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Dead load.</E> Measure and record initial elevation of the truss or trusses in the test position at no load. Apply to the top and bottom chords of the truss dead loads that are representative of the actual weights of materials to be supported by the truss. However, the dead load may only be applied as indicated in paragraph (e)(4) of this section for ongoing follow-up testing. Dead <PRTPAGE P="71"/>loads to be applied to the truss test assembly are permitted to include only the weights of materials supported by the truss and not the weight of the truss itself. However, readings from load cells (when used) on which the test truss rests must reflect the sum of the applied load plus the weight of the truss. Apply dead loads and hold for 5 minutes. Measure and record the deflections.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Live load.</E> Maintaining the dead loads, apply live load to the top chord in approximate <FR>1/4</FR> live load increments until dead load plus the live load is reached. Measure and record the deflections no sooner than one minute after each <FR>1/4</FR> live load increment has been applied and 5 minutes after the full live load has been reached.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Initial recovery phase.</E> Remove the design live load but not the dead load. Measure and record the deflections 5 minutes after the total live load has been removed.</P>
              <P>(iv) Continue to load the truss to:</P>
              <P>(A) Dead load plus 2.0 times the design live load. Maintain this loading for 6 hours and inspect the truss for failure. Failure is rupture, fracture, or excessive yielding; or</P>
              <P>(B) Dead load plus 1.75 times the design live load. Maintain this loading for 12 hours and inspect the truss for failure. Failure is rupture, fracture, or excessive yielding.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Final recovery phase.</E> Remove 2.0 times the design live load, but not the dead load or 1.75 times the design live load, but not the dead load. Measure and record deflections within 4 hours after removing 2.0 times the design live load or 1.75 times the design live load.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Acceptance criteria.</E> The truss design is acceptable if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The maximum deflection between no load and dead load must be L/480 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/180 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>
              <P>(B) The maximum deflection between dead load and design live load must be L/180 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>
              <P>(C) After the design live load is removed, and with the dead load still applied, the maximum recovery deflection must be L/360 or less for simply supported spans and Lo/180 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>
              <P>(D) The truss must maintain the overload condition for 6 hours without rupture or fracture, or excessive yielding; and</P>
              <P>(E) After 2.0 times the design live load has been removed, and with the dead load still applied, the maximum recovery deflection must be L/180 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>
              <P>(F) As applicable, each truss design must also meet all requirements for uplift loads required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For Wind Zone I uplift load requirements, see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. For Wind Zones II and III uplift load requirements, see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ultimate load truss test procedure.</E> (i) At least two average quality/consecutively tested trusses must pass all requirements of the test, for initial qualification of the truss design.

              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Live load.</E> Maintaining the dead loads, apply live load at a uniform rate to the top chord in approximate <FR>1/4</FR> live load increments until the dead load plus the live load is reached. Measure and record the deflections no sooner than one minute after each <FR>1/4</FR> live load increment has been applied and 5 minutes after the full live load has been reached.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Initial recovery phase.</E> Remove the design live load but not the dead load. Measure and record the deflections 5 minutes after the design live load has been removed.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Overload phase.</E> After the recovery phase is completed, reapply the full live load to the truss assembly. Additional loading shall then be applied continuously until the dead load plus 2.5 times the design live load is reached. This overload condition must be maintained for at least 5 minutes.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Final recovery phase.</E> Remove 2.5 times the design live load but not the dead load. Measure and record deflections within 4 hours after 2.5 times the design live load has been removed.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Acceptance criteria.</E> The truss design is acceptable if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) The maximum deflection between no load and dead load must be L/480 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/180 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>
              <P>(B) Dead load to design live load deflections shall be L/180 or less for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 or less for eave and cornice projections; and</P>

              <P>(D) The truss shall maintain the overload condition for 5 minutes without rupture, fracture, or excessive yielding; and</P>
              <P>(E) After 2.5 times the design live load is removed, and with the dead load still applied, the truss must recover to at least L/180 for simply supported clear spans and Lo/90 for eave and cornice within 4 hours after the total live load has been removed; and</P>
              <P>(F) As applicable, each truss design must also meet all requirements for uplift loads in Wind Zone I or Wind Zone II and III, as required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section. For Wind Zone I uplift load requirements, see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. For Wind Zones II and III uplift load requirements, see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Uplift load tests.</E> Each truss design must also pass all requirements of the uplift load test, as applicable, in paragraph (d)(3)(i) or (d)(3)(ii) and paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Wind Zone I uplift load test.</E> Where there are engineered connectors between the top chord and web members of the truss, such as metal connector plates or wood gussets or their equivalents, uplift testing in Wind Zone I is at the discretion of the Registered Engineer or Architect or nationally recognized testing laboratory certifying the truss design. When testing is deemed necessary by the Registered Engineer or Architect or nationally recognized testing laboratory certifying the truss design, a minimum of one average quality uplift load test is to be conducted for each such truss design and must pass all requirements of the test for initial qualification of the truss design. The net uplift load for trusses designed for use in Wind Zone I is 9 psf for the clear span of the truss and 22.5 psf for eave or cornice projections.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Wind Zones II and III uplift loads test.</E> This test is required for all trusses designed for use in Wind Zones II and III. A minimum of three average quality/consecutive uplift load tests are to be conducted for each truss design when tested in the inverted position and a minimum of two average quality/consecutive uplift load tests are to be conducted for trusses in the upright position. The trusses must pass all requirements of the test for initial qualification of the truss design. The uplift load for trusses designed to be used in Wind Zones II and III for the clear span or eave cornice projections is to be determined by subtracting the dead load applied to the truss from the uplift load provided in the Table of Design Wind Pressures in § 3280.305(c)(1)(ii)(B).<PRTPAGE P="73"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Trusses designed for use in Wind Zone I, when tested (see paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section), must be tested in either the inverted position to 2.5 times the net wind uplift load or in the upright position to 1.75 times the net wind uplift load. Trusses designed for use in Wind Zones II and III (see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) must be tested to 2.0 times the uplift load minus the dead load in the inverted position and to 1.75 times the uplift load minus the dead load in the upright position. See Figure 3280.402(b)(3).</P>
              <P>(iv) The following describes how to conduct the uplift test with the truss in the upright position. Similar procedures must be used if conducting the test in the inverted position.</P>
              <P>(A) Place the truss in the test fixture and position as it is intended to be installed in the manufactured home. See Figure 3280.402(b)(3).</P>

              <P>(B) Position the load measurement devices to register the wind uplift loads that will be applied to the top chord of the truss. The uplift loads shall be applied through tension devices not wider than one inch and spaced not greater than approximately 12 inches on center and shall be applied as uniform as possible, so as to simulate uniform loading. Gravity and wind uplift load tests may be performed on the same truss in this single setup mode. For the wind uplift test, it is permissible to stabilize the bottom chord of the truss in the test fixture to simulate ceiling materials or purlin supports. Measure and record the initial elevation of the bottom chord of the truss in the test position at the mid-span and quarter points of the truss, and at the free end of an eave or cornice projection greater than 12 inches. Scissors or other unique truss configurations are to be measured at as many additional bottom chord panel points as necessary to obtain an accurate representation of the <PRTPAGE P="74"/>deflected shape of the truss, so as to be able to locate and record the point(s) of maximum deflection. Eave or cornice projection loads are applied separately for eaves or cornice projections greater than 12 inches. For eave or cornice projections greater than 12 inches, the additional required load must be applied to the eave simultaneously with the main body load. For eave or cornice projections of 12 inches or less, add the additional required load to the main body load and apply it to the entire top chord.</P>
              <P>(C) Measure and record the deflection 5 minutes after the net uplift load has been applied. Design load deflection shall be L/180 or less for a simply supported clear span and Lo/90 or less for eave or cornice projections.</P>
              <P>(D) For trusses tested in the upright position, continue to load the truss to 1.75 times the net uplift load in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section for Wind Zone I and 1.75 times the uplift load in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) for Wind Zones II and III, and maintain the load for one minute. For trusses tested in the inverted position, continue to load the truss to 2.50 times the net uplift load in paragraph (d)(3)(i) for Wind Zone I and to 2.0 times the uplift load minus the dead load in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) for Wind Zones II and III, and maintain the full load for one minute.

                <TNOTE> Note: To use this table, first compute the restricted insulation thickness as a fraction of the uncompressed (full) insulation thickness. Then look up the <E T="03">R</E>-value remaining from the appropriate column (Non-uniform Restriction, Batt Non-uniform Restriction, Blown or Uniform Compression, Batt). Example: Assume a section of loose-fill ceiling insulation went from <E T="03">R</E>-25 insulation at a height of 10 inches to a minimum height of 2 inches at the edge of the ceiling. The ratio of minimum to full thickness is 0.20 (2 divided by 10). Look up 0.20 (20 percent), read across to column 3 (Non-uniform Restriction, Blown), and read 50 percent. Therefore, the <E T="03">R</E>-value of the loose-fill insulation over the restricted area would be <E T="03">R</E>-12.5 (50 percent of 25).</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>(a) Non-uniform restriction is that which occurs between non-parallel planes, such as in the ceiling near the eaves.</TNOTE>
                <TNOTE>(b) Uniform compression is compression between parallel planes, such as that which occurs in a wall.</TNOTE>

              <P>(1) Steel or wrought-iron pipe shall comply with ANSI Standard B36.10-1979, Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe. Threaded brass pipe in iron pipe sizes may be used. Threaded brass pipe shall comply with ASTM B43-91, Standard Specification for Seamless Red Brass Pipe, Standard Sizes.</P>
              <P>(2) Fittings for gas piping shall be wrought iron, malleable iron, steel, or brass (containing not more than 75 percent copper).</P>
              <P>(3) Copper tubing must be annealed type, Grade K or L, conforming to the Standard Specification for Seamless Copper Water Tube, ASTM B88-93, or must comply with the Standard Specification for Seamless Copper Tube for Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Service, ASTM B280-1995. Copper tubing must be internally tinned.</P>
              <P>(4) Steel tubing must have a minimum wall thickness of 0.032 inch for tubing of <FR>1/2</FR> inch diameter and smaller and 0.049 inch for diameters <FR>1/2</FR> inch and larger. Steel tubing must be in accordance with ASTM Standard Specification for Electric-Resistance-Welded Coiled Steel Tubing for Gas and Fuel Oil Lines, ASTM A539-1999, and must be externally corrosion protected.</P>
              <P>(5) Corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) systems must be listed and installed in accordance with ANSI/IAS LC-1-1997, Fuel Gas Piping Systems Using Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing (CSST) (incorporated by reference, see § 3280.4), and the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Piping design.</E> Each manufactured home requiring fuel gas for any purpose shall be equipped with a natural gas piping system acceptable for LP-gas. Where fuel gas piping is to be installed in more than one section of an expandable or multiple unit home, the design and construction of the crossover(s) shall be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) All points of crossover shall be readily accessible from the exterior of the home.</P>
              <P>(2) The connection(s) between units must be made with a connector(s) listed for exterior use or direct plumbing sized in accordance with § 3280.705(d). A shutoff valve of the non-displaceable rotor type conforming to ANSI Z21.15-1997, Manually Operated Gas Valves for Appliances, Appliances Connector Valves, and Hose End Valves, suitable for outdoor use must be installed at each crossover point upstream of the connection.</P>
              <P>(3) The connection(s) may be made by a listed quick disconnect device which shall be designed to provide a positive seal of the supply side of the gas system when such device is separated.</P>
              <P>(4) The flexible connector, direct plumbing pipe, or “quick disconnect” device shall be provided with protection from mechanical and impact damage and located to minimize the possibility of tampering.</P>
              <P>(5) For gas line cross over connections made with either hard pipe or flexible connectors, the crossover point(s) shall be capped on the supply side to provide a positive seal and covered on the other side with a suitable protective covering.</P>
              <P>(6) Suitable protective coverings for the connection device(s) when separated, shall be permanently attached to the device or flexible connector.</P>

              <P>(7) When a quick disconnect device is installed, a 3 inch by 1<FR>3/4</FR> inch minimum size tag made of etched, metal-stamped or embossed brass, stainless steel, anodized or alcalde aluminum not less than 0.020 inch thick or other approved <PRTPAGE P="109"/>material (e.g., 0.005 inch plastic laminates) shall be permanently attached on the exterior wall adjacent to the access to the “quick disconnect” device. Each tag shall be legibly inscribed with the following information using letters no smaller than <FR>1/4</FR> inch high:</P>

In operation, the transportation system (supporting the manufactured home structure and its contents) shall effectively respond to the control of the braking, while traveling at applicable towing vehicle in terms of tracking and highway speeds and in normal highway traffic conditions.</P>
              <NOTE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Note:</HD>
                <P>While the majority of manufactured homes utilize a fabricated steel frame assembly, upon which the manufactured home structure is constructed, it is not the intent of this standard to limit innovation. Therefore, other concepts, such as integrating the frame function into the manufactured home structure, are acceptable provided that such design meets the intent and requirements of this part).</P>
              </NOTE>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Drawbar.</E> The drawbar shall be constructed of sufficient strength, rigidity and durability to safely withstand those dynamic forces experienced during highway transportation. It shall be securely fastened to the manufactured home frame by either a continuous weld or by bolting.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Coupling mechanism.</E> The coupling mechanism (which is usually of the socket type) shall be securely fastened to the drawbar in such a manner as to assure safe and effective transfer of the maximum loads, including dynamic loads, between the manufactured home structure and the hitch-assembly of the towing vehicle. The coupling shall be equipped with a manually operated mechanism so adapted as to prevent disengagement of the unit while in operation. The coupling shall be so designed that it can be disconnected regardless of the angle of the manufactured home to the towing vehicle. With the manufactured home parked on level ground, the center of the socket of the coupler shall not be less than 20 inches nor more than 26 inches from ground level.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Chassis.</E> The chassis, in conjunction with the manufactured home structure, shall be designed and constructed to effectively sustain the designed loads consisting of the dead load plus a minimum of 3 pounds per square foot floor load, (example: free-standing range, refrigerator, and loose furniture) and the superimposed dynamic load resulting from highway movement but shall not be required to exceed twice the dead load. The integrated design shall be capable of insuring rigidity and structural integrity of the complete manufactured home structure and to insure against deformation of structural or finish members during the intended life of the home.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Running gear assembly.</E> (i) The running gear assembly, as part of the chassis, shall be designed to perform, as a balanced system, in order to effectively sustain the designed loads set forth in § 3280.904(b)(3) and to provide for durable dependable safe mobility of the manufactured home. It shall be designed to accept shock and vibration, both from the highway and the towing vehicle and effectively dampen these forces so as to protect the manufactured home structure from damage and fatigue. Its components shall be designed to facilitate routine maintenance, inspection and replacement.</P>
              <P>(ii) Location of the running gear assembly shall be determined by documented engineering analysis, taking into account the gross weight (including all contents), total length of the manufactured home, the necessary coupling hitch weight, span distance, and turning radius. The coupling weight shall be not less than 12 percent nor more than 25 percent of the gross weight.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Spring assemblies.</E> Spring assemblies (springs, hangers, shackles, bushings and mounting bolts) shall be capable of withstanding all the design loads as outlined in § 3280.904(b)(3) without exceeding maximum allowable stresses for design spring assembly life as recommended by the spring assembly manufacturer. The capacity of the spring system shall assure, that under maximum operating load conditions, sufficient clearance shall be maintained between the tire and manufactured home frame or structure to permit unimpeded wheel movement and for changing tires.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Axles.</E> Axles, and their connecting hardware, shall be capable of withstanding all of the design loads outlined in § 3280.904(b)(3) without exceeding maximum allowable stresses for design axle life as recommended by the axle manufacturer. The number of <PRTPAGE P="137"/>axles required to provide a safe tow and good ride characteristics shall be determined and documented by engineering analysis. Those alternatives listed in § 3280.903(c) may be accepted in place of such an analysis.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Hubs and bearings.</E> Hubs and bearings shall meet the requirements of § 3280.904(b)(3) and good engineering practice. Both of these components shall be accessible for inspection, routine maintenance and replacement of parts.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Tires, wheels and rims.</E> Tires, wheels and rims shall meet the requirements of § 3280.904(b)(3). Tires shall be selected for anticipated usage.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Brake assemblies.</E> (i) The number, type, size and design of brake assemblies required to assist the towing vehicle in providing effective control and stopping of the manufactured home shall be determined and documented by engineering analysis. Those alternatives listed in § 3280.903(c) may be accepted in place of such an analysis.</P>
              <P>(ii) Brakes on the towing vehicle and the manufactured home shall be capable of assuring that the maximum stopping distance from an initial velocity of 20 miles per hour does not exceed 40 feet (U.S. Department of Transportation Regulations).</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Lights and associated wiring.</E> Highway safety electrical lights and associated wiring shall conform to applicable Federal requirements in terms of location and performance. The manufacturer shall have the option of meeting this requirement by utilizing a temporary light/wiring harness provided by the manufactured home transportation carrier.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope and purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (title VI of Pub. L. 93-383, 88 Stat. 700, 42 U.S.C. 5401, <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (hereinafter referred to as the Act), requires <PRTPAGE P="139"/>the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards and to issue regulations to carry out the purpose of the Act. The standards promulgated pursuant to the Act appear at part 3280 of chapter XX of this title, and apply to all manufactured homes manufactured for sale to purchasers in the United States on or after the effective date of the standards (June 15, 1976). A manufactured home is manufactured on or after June 15, 1976, if it enters the first stage of production on or after that date.</P>
              <P>(b) The Secretary is also authorized by the Act to conduct inspections and investigations necessary to enforce the standards, to determine that a manufactured home fails to comply with an applicable standard or contains a defect or an imminent safety hazard, and to direct the manufacturer to furnish notification thereof, and in some cases, to remedy the defect or imminent safety hazard. The purpose of this part is to prescribe procedures for the implementation of these responsibilities of the Secretary under the Act through the use of private and State inspection organizations and cooperation with State manufactured home agencies. It is the policy of the Department to involve State agencies in the enforcement of the Federal manufactured home standards to the maximum extent possible consistent with the capabilities of such agencies and the public interest. The procedures for investigations and investigational proceedings are set forth in 24 CFR part 3800.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Alteration</E> means the replacement, addition, and modification, or removal of any equipment or installation after sale by a manufacturer to a retailer or distributor but prior to sale by a retailer to a purchaser which may affect the construction, fire safety, occupancy, plumbing, heat-producing or electrical system. It includes any modification made in the manufactured home that may affect the compliance of the home with the standards, but it does not include the repair or replacement of a component or appliance requiring plug-in to an electrical receptacle where the replaced item is of the same configuration and rating as the one being replaced. It also does not include the addition of an appliance requiring <E T="03">plug-in</E> to an electrical receptacle, which appliance was not provided with the manufactured home by the manufacturer, if the rating of the appliance does not exceed the rating of the receptacle to which it is connected.</P>

              <P>(b) No State may require, as a condition of entry into or sale in the State, a manufactured home certified (by the application of the label required by § 3282.362(c)(2)(i)) as in conformance with the Federal standards to be subject to State inspection to determine compliance with any standard covering any aspect of the manufactured home covered by the Federal standards. Nor may any State require that a State label be placed on the manufactured home certifying conformance to the Federal standard or an identical standard. Certain actions that States are permitted to take are set out in § 3282.303.</P>
              <P>(c) States may participate in the enforcement of the Federal standards enforcement program under these regulations either as SAAs or PIAs or both. These regulations establish the exclusive system for enforcement of the Federal standards. No State may establish or keep in effect through a building code enforcement system or otherwise, procedures or requirements which constitute systems for enforcement of the Federal standards or of identical State standards which are outside the system established in these regulations or which go beyond this system to require remedial actions which are not required by the Act and these regulations. A State may establish or continue in force consumer protections, such as warranty or warranty performance requirements, which respond to individual consumer complaints and so do not constitute systems of enforcement of the Federal standards, regardless of whether the State qualifies as an SAA or PIA.</P>

              <P>(d) No State or locality may establish or enforce any rule or regulation or take any action that stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. The test of whether a State rule or action is valid or must give way is whether the State rule can be enforced or the action taken without impairing the Federal superintendence of the manufactured <PRTPAGE P="144"/>home industry as established by the Act.</P>

              <P>(e) As part of this certification, the manufacturer shall identify each certified structure by a permanent serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of production. If the manufacturer also manufactures manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c), the series of serial numbers for structures certified under this section shall be distinguishable on the structures and in the manufacturer's records from the series of serial numbers for the manufactured homes that are certified under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c).</P>
              <P>(1) If a manufacturer wishes to certify a structure as a manufactured home under §§ 3282.205 and 3282.362(c) after having applied a serial number identifying it as exempted under this section, the manufacturer may do so only with the written consent of the Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agency (IPIA) after thorough inspection of the structure by the IPIA at at least one stage of production and such removal or equipment, components, or materials as the IPIA may require to perform inspections to assure that the structure conforms to the Federal manufactured home standards. The manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number required by § 3280.6.</P>
              <P>(2) A manufacturer may not certify a structure under this section after having applied the manufactured home serial number under § 3280.6.</P>
              <P>(f) All certifications made under this section are subject to investigation by the Secretary to determine their accuracy. If a certification is false or inaccurate, the certification for purposes of this section is invalid and the structures that have been or may be the subject of the certification are not excluded from the coverage of the Act, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, or these Regulations.</P>

              <P>(1) If the Secretary has information that a certification may be false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice of the nature of this information by certified mail and the procedure of this subparagraph will be followed.<PRTPAGE P="146"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer must investigate this matter and report its findings in writing as to the validity of this information to the Secretary within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a written report is received within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will review this report before determining whether a certification is false or inaccurate. If a report is not received within 15 days from the receipt of the Secretary's notice, the Secretary will make the determination on the basis of the information presented.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Secretary determines that a certification is false or inaccurate, the manufacturer will be given written notice and the reasons for this determination by certified mail.</P>
              <P>(2) The Secretary may seek civil and criminal penalties provided for in section 611 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 5410, if the party in question in the exercise of due care has reason to know that such certification is false or misleading as to any material fact.</P>

              <P>(a) The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for voluntary certification of non-conforming manufactured homes as required by 42 U.S.C. 5402(6) as amended by section 308(d)(B) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980.</P>

              <P>(b) Structures which meet all of the requirements of a <E T="03">manufactured home</E> as set out in § 3282.7(u), except the size requirements, shall be <E T="03">manufactured homes</E> if the manufacturer files with the Secretary a certification in the following form:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>[Name of manufacturer and address where structures are to be manufactured] certifies that it intends to manufacture structures that meet all of the requirements of manufactured homes set forth at 42 U.S.C. 5402(6) except the size requirements. Such structures are to be treated as manufactured homes for the purposes of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Such structures will be built in conformance with the Standards. [Name of manufacturer] further certifies that if, at any time it manufactures structures which are not manufactured homes, it will identify each such structure by a permanent serial number placed on the structure during the first stage of production and that the series of serial numbers for such structures shall be distinguishable on the structures and in its records from the series of serial numbers used for manufactured homes.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c) Whenever a manufacturer which has filed a certification pursuant to § 3282.13(b) produces structures which are not manufactured homes, it must identify each such structure by placing a permanent serial number on the structure during the first stage of production. The series of serial numbers placed on these structures shall be distinguishable on the structure and in the manufacturer's records from the series of serial numbers used for manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer may certify a structure as a manufactured home after having applied a serial number identifying it as a structure which is not a manufactured home. To do so, the manufacturer must secure the written consent of the IPIA. This consent may only be given after a DAPIA has approved the manufacturer's design and quality assistance manual in accordance with § 3282.361, and after the IPIA has thoroughly inspected the structure in at least one stage of production and after such removal of equipment, components or materials as the IPIA may require to assure that the structure conforms to the standards. After certification as a manufactured home has been approved, the manufacturer shall remove the original serial number and add the serial number required by § 3280.6.</P>
              <P>(e) Once a manufacturer has certified under § 3282.13(b) that it intends to build structures which are manufactured homes in all respects except size, the manufacturer must then, with respect to those structures, comply with all of the requirements of the Act and its regulations. The structures may not thereafter be exempted under any other section of these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Alternative construction of manufactured homes.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> In order to promote the purposes of the Act, the Department will permit the sale or lease of one or more manufactured homes not in compliance with the Standards under circumstances wherein no affirmative action is needed to protect the public interest. The Department encourages innovation and the use of new technology in manufactured homes. Accordingly, HUD will permit manufacturers to utilize new designs or techniques not in compliance with the Standards in cases:</P>
              <P>(1) Where a manufacturer proposes to utilize construction that would be prohibited by the Standards;</P>
              <P>(2) Where such construction would provide performance that is equivalent to or superior to that required by the Standards; and</P>
              <P>(3) Where (i) compliance with the Standards would be unreasonable because of the circumstances of the particular case, or (ii) the alternative construction would be for purposes of research, testing or development of new techniques or designs. If a request for alternative construction is submitted and the facts are consistent with these principles, the Secretary may issue a letter under paragraph (c) of this section stating that no action will be taken under the Act based upon specific failures to conform to the Standards or these regulations, provided that certain conditions are met. The issuance of a letter under paragraph (c) of this section will not affect any right that any purchaser may have under the Act or other applicable law and will not preclude any further agency action that may become necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for alternative construction.</E> A manufacturer may submit a request for alternative construction of a manufactured home. The request should be sent to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Manufactured Housing Standards Division, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. The request must include:</P>
              <P>(1) A copy of the manufactured design or plan for each nonconforming model which a manufacturer plans to build;</P>
              <P>(2) An explanation of the manner in which the design fails to conform with the Standards, including a list of the specific standards involved;</P>
              <P>(3) An explanation of how the design will result in homes that provide the same level of performance, quality, durability and safety as would be provided under the Standards;</P>
              <P>(4) A copy of data adequate to support the request, including applicable test data, engineering calculations or certifications from nationally recognized laboratories;</P>
              <P>(5) An estimate of the maximum number of manufactured home units affected and the location, if known, to which the units will be shipped;</P>
              <P>(6) An indication of the period of time during which the manufacturer proposes to engage in the manufacture, sale or lease of the nonconforming homes;</P>
              <P>(7) A copy of the proposed notice to be provided to home purchasers;</P>
              <P>(8) A list of the names and addresses of any retailers that would be selling the nonconforming homes; and</P>
              <P>(9) A letter from the manufacturer's DAPIA indicating that the design(s) to which any nonconforming homes would be built meet the Standards in all other respects.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Issuance of the letter by the Secretary</E>—(1) <E T="03">Contents of the letter.</E> If the Secretary issues a letter in response to a request for alternative construction, the letter shall include the specific standards affected, an explanation of the proposed activity or design, an explanation of how the request is consistent with the objectives of the Act, and any conditions that the manufacturer must meet.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Letter sent to IPIA, DAPIA and SAA.</E> The Secretary shall forward a copy of the letter to the manufacturer's IPIA and DAPIA along with a letter authorizing the DAPIA to approve plans containing the alternative construction, and authorizing the IPIA to permit use of the alternative construction, provided that the conditions set forth in the letter are met. The Secretary shall also forward a copy of the letter to the SAAs in the State of manufacture and the State(s) in which the homes are to be located, if known.<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative construction in additional models.</E> In cases where the Secretary grants a letter under this paragraph that is not model-specific, the Secretary may permit the manufacturer to include the alternative construction in additional models. In such cases, the DAPIA shall notify the Department of additional models that incorporate the alternative construction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Revocation.</E> The Secretary may revoke or amend a letter issued under paragraph (c) of this section at any time. Such revocation or amendment will be prospective only. Where manufacturers have requested alternative construction for research, testing or development such alternative construction may not achieve the anticipated results. Therefore, the Secretary may require a manufacturer to bring those homes into compliance with the standards if, after the alternative construction has been in use for a period of time specified by the Secretary, these homes are not, in the Secretary's judgment, providing the levels of safety, quality and durability which would have been provided had the homes been built in compliance with the Standards.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice to prospective purchasers.</E> Manufacturers receiving letters under paragraph (c) of this section shall provide notice to prospective purchasers that the home does not conform to the Standards. Such notice shall be delivered to each prospective purchase before he or she enters into an agreement to purchase the home. The notice shall be in the following form or in such other form as may be approved by the Secretary:

              <SUBJECT>Applicability and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart sets out procedures to be followed when an opportunity to present views provided for in the Act is requested by an appropriate party. Section 3282.152 provides for two types of procedures that may be followed, one informal and nonadversary, and one more formal and adversary. Section 3282.152 also sets out criteria to govern which type of procedure will be followed in particular cases.</P>
              <P>(b) The procedures of § 3282.152 also apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) Proceedings held by the Secretary whenever the suspension or disqualification of a primary inspection agency, which has been granted final approval, is recommended under § 3282.356 of these regulations, and</P>
              <P>(2) Resolution of disputes where an SAA or manufacturer disagrees with a determination of a DAPIA under § 3282.361 that a manufactured home design does or does not conform to the standards or that a quality assurance manual is or is not adequate with a decision by an IPIA to red tag or not to red tag or to provide or not to provide a certification label for a manufactured home under § 3282.362 when the IPIA believes that the manufactured home does or does not conform to the standards.</P>
              <P>(c) The procedures set out in § 3282.152 shall also be followed whenever State Administrative Agencies hold Formal or Informal Presentations of Views under § 3282.309.</P>

              <P>(d) To the extent that these regulations provide for Formal or Informal <PRTPAGE P="152"/>Presentations of Views for parties that would otherwise qualify for hearings under 2 CFR part 2424, the procedures of 2 CFR part 2424 shall not be available and shall not apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures to present views and evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> All Formal and Informal Presentations of Views under this subpart shall be public, unless, for good cause, the Secretary determines it is in the public interest that a particular proceeding should be closed. If the Secretary determines that a proceeding should be closed, the Secretary shall state and make publicly available the basis for that determination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request.</E> Upon receipt of a request to present views and evidence under the Act, the Secretary shall determine whether the proceeding will be a Formal or an Informal Presentation of Views, and shall issue a notice under paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Notice.</E> When the Secretary decides to conduct a Formal or an Informal Presentation of Views under this section, the Secretary shall provide notice as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) Except where the need for swift resolution of the question involved prohibits it, notice of a proceeding hereunder shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at least 10 days prior to the date of the proceeding. In any case, notice shall be provided to interested persons to the maximum extent practicable. Direct notice shall be sent by certified mail to the parties involved in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) The notice, whether published or mailed, shall include a statement of the time, place and nature of the proceeding; reference to the authority under which the proceeding will be held; a statement of the subject matter of the proceeding, the parties and issues involved; and a statement of the manner in which interested persons shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in the hearing.</P>
              <P>(3) The notice shall designate the official who shall be the presiding officer for the proceedings and to whom all inquiries should be directed concerning such proceedings.</P>
              <P>(4) The notice shall state whether the proceeding shall be held in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)—(Informal Presentation of Views) or paragraph (g)—(Formal Presentation of Views) of this section, except that when the Secretary makes the determinations provided for in sections 623 (d) and (f) of the Act, the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section shall apply. In determining whether the requirements of paragraph (f) or those of paragraph (g) of this section shall apply the Secretary shall consider the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The necessity for expeditious action;</P>
              <P>(ii) The risk of injury to affected members of the public;</P>
              <P>(iii) The economic consequences of the decisions to be rendered; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Such other factors as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Department representative.</E> If the Department is to be represented by Counsel, such representation shall be by a Department hearing attorney designated by the General Counsel.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reporting and transcription.</E> Oral proceedings shall be stenographically or mechanically reported and transcribed under the supervision of the presiding officer, unless the presiding officer and the parties otherwise agree, in which case a summary approved by the presiding officer shall be kept. The original transcript or summary shall be a part of the record and the sole official transcript, or summary. A copy of the transcript or summary shall be available to any person at a fee established by the Secretary, which fee the Secretary may waive in the public interest. Any information contained in the transcript or summary which would be exempt from required disclosure under § 3282.54 of these regulations may be protected from disclosure if appropriate under that section upon a request for such protection under § 3282.54(c).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Informal presentation of views.</E> (1) An Informal Presentation of Views may be written or oral, and may include an opportunity for an oral presentation, whether requested or not, whenever the Secretary concludes that <PRTPAGE P="153"/>an oral presentation would be in the public interest, and so states in the notice. A presiding officer shall preside over all oral presentations held under this subsection. The purpose of any such presentation shall be to gather information to allow fully informed decision making. Informal Presentations of Views shall not be adversary proceedings. Oral presentations shall be conducted in an informal but orderly manner. The presiding officer shall have the duty and authority to conduct a fair proceeding, to take all necessary action to avoid delay, and to maintain order. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the presiding officer at an oral Informal Presentation of Views shall not require that testimony be given under an oath or affirmation, and shall not permit either cross-examination of witnesses by other witnesses or their representatives, or the presentation of rebuttal testimony by persons who have already testified. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not control the conduct of oral Informal Presentations of Views.</P>
              <P>(2) Within 10 days after an Informal Presentation of Views, the presiding officer shall refer to the Secretary all documentary evidence submitted, the transcript, if any, a summary of the issues involved and information presented in the Informal Presentation of Views and the presiding official's recommendations, with the rationale therefor. The presiding officer shall make any appropriate statements concerning the apparent veracity of witnesses or the validity of factual assertions which may be within the competence of the presiding officer. The Secretary shall issue a Final Determination concerning the matters at issue within 30 days of receipt of the presiding officer's summary. The Final Determination shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement of findings, with specific references to principal supporting items of evidence in the record and conclusions, as well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon all of the material issues of fact, law, or discretion as presented on the record, and</P>
              <P>(ii) An appropriate order. Notice of the Final Determination shall be given in writing and transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all participants in the presentation of views. The Final Determination shall be conclusive, with respect to persons whose interests were represented.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Formal presentation of views.</E> (1) A Formal Presentation of Views is an adversary proceeding and includes an opportunity for the oral presentation of evidence. All witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the presiding officer. Participants shall have the right to present such oral or documentary evidence and to conduct such cross-examination as the presiding officer determines is required for a full and true disclosure of facts. The presiding officer shall receive relevant and material evidence, rule upon offers of proof and exclude all irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence. However, the technicalities of the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not control the conduct of a Formal Presentation of Views. The presiding officer shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of the Formal Presentation of Views to avoid delay and to maintain order. The presiding officer may exclude the attorney or witness from further participation in the particular Formal Presentation of Views and may render a decision adverse to the interests of the excluded party in his absence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Decision.</E> The presiding officer shall make and file an initial written decision on the matter in question. The decision shall be filed within 10 days after completion of the oral presentation. The decision shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement of findings of fact, with specific references to principal supporting items of evidence in the record and conclusions, as well as the reasons or bases therefor, upon all of the material issues of law or discretion presented on the record, and</P>
              <P>(ii) An appropriate order.</P>

              <FP>The presiding officer's decision shall be final and shall constitute the Final Determination of the Secretary unless reversed or modified within 30 days by the Secretary. Notice of the Final Determination shall be given in writing, and transmitted by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to all participants in the proceeding. The <PRTPAGE P="154"/>Final Determination shall be conclusive with respect to persons whose interests were represented.</FP>

              <P>(10) Detailed manufacturer installation instructions including specifications and procedures for the erection and hook-up of the home at its permanent location, and</P>
              <P>(11) Reports of all tests that were run to validate the conformance of the design to the standards.</P>
              <P>(c) The manufacturer shall submit to the DAPIA such information as the DAPIA may require in order to carry out quality assurance manual approvals. At a minimum, this information shall include the quality assurance manual for which approval is sought. That manual shall include the manufacturer's quality assurance program, an organizational chart showing the accountability, by position, of the manufacturer's quality control personnel, a description of production tests and test equipment required for compliance with the standards, a station-by-station description of the manufacturing process, a list of quality control inspections required by the manufacturer at each station, and identification by title of each person who will be held accountable for each quality control inspection.</P>
              <P>(d) Manufacturers may be required to furnish supplementary information to the DAPIA if the design information or the quality assurance manual is not complete or if any information is not in accordance with accepted engineering practice.</P>
              <P>(e) When a manufacturer wishes to make a change in an approved design or quality assurance manual, the manufacturer shall obtain the approval of the DAPIA which approved the design or manual prior to production for sale. The procedures for obtaining such approval are set out in § 3282.361. When applicable under § 3282.605, the IPIA must concur in the change before it can be approved by the DAPIA.</P>
              <P>(f) The information to be submitted to a DAPIA under § 3282.203 (b) and (c) may be prepared by the manufacturer's staff or outside consultants, including other DAPIAs. However, a DAPIA may not perform design or quality assurance manual approvals for any manufacturer whose design or manual has been created or prepared in whole or in part by members of the DAPIA's organization or of any affiliated organization.</P>
              <P>(g) Each manufacturer shall maintain a copy of the drawings, specifications, and sketches from each approved design received from a DAPIA under § 3282.361(b)(4) in each plant in which manufactured homes are being produced to the design. Each manufacturer shall also maintain in each manufacturing plant a copy of the approved quality assurance manual received from a DAPIA under § 3282.361(c)(3) that is being followed in the plant.

              <EXTRACT>

                <P>Many states have a consumer assistance or dispute resolution program that homeowners may use to resolve problems with manufacturers, retailers, or installers concerning defects in their manufactured homes that render part of the home unfit for its intended use. Such state programs may include a process to resolve a dispute among a manufacturer, a retailer, and an installer about who will correct the defect. In states where there is not a dispute resolution program that meets the federal requirements, the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program will operate. These are “HUD-administered states.” The HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program is not for cosmetic or minor problems in the home. You may contact the HUD Manufactured Housing Program Office at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891, or visit the HUD website at <E T="03">www.hud.gov</E> to determine whether your state has a state program or whether you should use the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program. Contact information for state programs is also available on the HUD website. If your state has a state program, please contact the state for information about the program, how it operates, and what steps to take to request dispute resolution. When there is no state dispute resolution program, a homeowner may use the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program to resolve disputes among the manufacturer, retailer, and installer about responsibility for the correction or repair of defects in the manufactured home that were reported during the 1-year period starting on the date of installation. Even after the 1-year period, manufacturers have continuing responsibility to review certain problems that affect the intended use of the manufactured home or its parts, but for which correction may no longer be required under federal law.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(2) The manufacturer must include the following language under a heading of “Additional Information “ HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program” in the consumer manual:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>The steps and information outlined below apply only to the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program that operates in HUD-administered states, as described under the heading “Dispute Resolution Information” in this manual. Under the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program, homeowners must report defects to the manufacturer, retailer, installer, a State Administrative Agency, or HUD within 1 year after the date of the first installation. Homeowners are encouraged to report defects in writing, including, but not limited to, email, written letter, certified mail, or fax, but they may also make a report by telephone. To demonstrate that the report was made within 1 year after the date of installation, homeowners should report defects in a manner that will create a dated record of the report: for example, by certified mail, by fax, or by email. When making a report by telephone, homeowners are encouraged to make a note of the phone call, including names of conversants, date, and time. No particular format is required to submit a report of an alleged defect, but any such report should at a minimum include a description of the alleged defect, the name of the homeowner, and the address of the home.</P>

                <P>Homeowners are encouraged to send reports of an alleged defect first to the manufacturer, retailer, or installer of the manufactured home, or a State Administrative Agency. Reports of alleged defects may also be sent to HUD at: HUD, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing, Attn: Dispute Resolution, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-8000; faxed to (202) 708-4213; e-mailed to <E T="03">mhs@hud.gov,</E> or reported telephonically at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891.</P>

                <P>If, after taking the steps outlined above, the homeowner does not receive a satisfactory response from the manufacturer, retailer, or installer, the homeowner may file a dispute resolution request with the dispute resolution provider in writing, or by making a request by phone. No particular format is required to make a request for dispute resolution, but the request should generally include the following information:<PRTPAGE P="159"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) The name, address, and contact information of the homeowner;</P>
                <P>(2) The name and contact information of the manufacturer, retailer, and installer of the manufactured home;</P>
                <P>(3) The date or dates the report of the alleged defect was made;</P>
                <P>(4) Identification of the entities or persons to whom each report of the alleged defect was made and the method that was used to make the report;</P>
                <P>(5) The date of installation of the manufactured home affected by the alleged defect; and</P>
                <P>(6) A description of the alleged defect.</P>

                <P>Information about the dispute resolution provider and how to make a request for dispute resolution is available at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov</E> or by contacting the Office of Manufactured Housing Programs at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891.</P>
                <P>A screening agent will review the request and, as appropriate, forward the request to the manufacturer, retailer, installer, and mediator. The mediator will mediate the dispute and attempt to facilitate a settlement. The parties to a settlement include, as applicable, the manufacturer, retailer, and installer. If the parties are unable to reach a settlement that results in correction or repair of the alleged defect, any party or the homeowner may request nonbinding arbitration. Should any party refuse to participate, the arbitration shall proceed without that party's input. Once the arbitrator makes a non-binding recommendation, the arbitrator will forward it to the parties and HUD. HUD will have the option of adopting, modifying, or rejecting the recommendation when issuing an order requiring the responsible party or parties to make any corrections or repairs in the home. At any time before HUD issues a final order, the parties may submit an offer of settlement to HUD that may, at HUD's discretion, be incorporated into the order.</P>
                <P>In circumstances where the parties agree that one or more of them, and not the homeowner, is responsible for the alleged defect, the parties will have the opportunity to resolve the dispute outside of the HUD Mediation and Arbitration process by using the Alternative Process. Homeowners will maintain the right to be informed in writing of the outcome when the Alternative Process is used, within 5 days of the outcome. At any time after 30 days of the Alternative Process notification, any participant or the homeowner may invoke the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program and proceed to mediation.</P>
                <P>The HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program is not a warranty program and does not replace the manufacturer's or any other warranty program.</P>

              <P>(f) If a consumer manual or a change or revision to a manual does not substantially comply with the guidelines issued by HUD, the manufacturer shall cease distribution of the consumer manual and shall provide a corrected manual for each manufactured home for which the inadequate or incorrect manual or revision was provided. A manual substantially complies with the guidelines if it includes the language in paragraph (e) of this section and presents current material on each of the subjects covered in the guidelines in sufficient detail to inform consumers about the operation, maintenance, and repair of manufactured homes. An updated copy of guidelines published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> on March 15, 1996, can be obtained by contacting the Office of Manufactured Housing and Regulatory Functions, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20410; the Information Center, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 1202, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC, 20410; or any HUD Area or State Office.</P>

It prohibits the sale, lease, or offer for sale or lease of manufactured homes known by the distributor or retailer not to be in conformance with the standards, and it includes responsibilities for maintaining certain records and assisting in the gathering of certain information.</P>
              <P>(b) The purpose of this subpart is to inform distributors and retailers when they may sell manufactured homes, when they are prohibited from selling manufactured homes, and what they may do in order to prepare a manufactured home for sale if it is not in conformance with the standards.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this part, any manufacturer or distributor who sells, leases, or offers for sale or lease a manufactured home to a purchaser shall be a retailer for purposes of that transaction.</P>

              <P>(a) No distributor or retailer shall make use of any means of transportation affecting interstate or foreign commerce or the mails to sell, lease, or offer for sale or lease in the United States any manufactured home manufactured on or after the effective date of an applicable standard unless:</P>
              <P>(1) There is affixed to the manufactured home a label certifying that the manufactured home conforms to applicable standards as required by § 3282.205(c), and</P>
              <P>(2) The distributor or retailer, acting as a reasonable distributor or retailer, does not know that the manufactured home does not conform to any applicable standards.</P>
              <P>(b) This prohibition applies to any affected manufactured homes until the completion of the entire sales transaction. A sales transaction with a purchaser is considered completed when all the goods and services that the retailer agreed to provide at the time the contract was entered into have been provided. Completion of a retail sale will be at the time the retailer completes installation of the manufactured home, if the retailer has agreed to provide the installation, or at the time the retailer delivers the home to a transporter, if the retailer has not agreed to transport or install the manufactured home. The sale is also complete upon delivery to the site if the retailer has not agreed to provide installation as completion of sale, except that any sale or lease under subpart M and as provided in § 3286.117(a) will not be considered complete until the purchaser or lessor, as applicable, has been provided with a final site inspection report.</P>
              <P>(c) This prohibition of sale does not apply to manufactured homes which are placed in production prior to the effective date of the standards, and it does not apply to “used” manufactured homes which are being sold or offered for sale after the first purchase in good faith for purposes other than the resale.</P>

              <P>(b) When, in accordance with § 3282.415, a manufacturer corrects a failure to conform to the applicable standard or an imminent safety hazard, the distributor or retailer, acting as a reasonable distributor or retailer, may accept the remedies provided by the manufacturer as having corrected the failure to conform or imminent safety <PRTPAGE P="162"/>hazard. The distributor or retailer, therefore, may sell, lease, or offer for sale or lease any manufactured home so corrected by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) When a distributor or retailer is authorized by a manufacturer to correct a failure to conform to the applicable standard or an imminent safety hazard and completes the correction in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, the distributor or retailer may sell, or lease or offer for sale or lease the manufactured home in question, provided that the distributor or retailer, acting as a reasonable distributor or retailer knows that the manufactured home conforms to the standards. A distributor or retailer and a manufacturer, at the manufacturer's option, may agree in advance that the distributor or retailer is authorized to make such corrections as the manufacturer believes are within the expertise of the dealer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Monitoring inspection fee establishment and distribution.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Each approved State shall establish a monitoring inspection fee in an amount required by the Secretary. This fee shall be an amount paid by each manufactured home manufacturer in the State for each transportable section of each manufactured housing unit produced by the manufacturer in that State. In non-approved and conditionally-approved States, the fee shall be set by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(b) The monitoring inspection fee shall be paid by the manufacturer to the Secretary or to the Secretary's Agent, who shall distribute a portion of the fees collected from all manufactured home manufacturers among the approved and conditionally-approved States in accordance with an agreement between the Secretary and the States and based upon the following formula:<PRTPAGE P="166"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) $9.00 of the monitoring inspection fee collected for each transportable section of each new manufactured housing unit that, after leaving the manufacturing plant, is first located on the premises of a retailer, distributor, or purchaser in that State; plus</P>
              <P>(2) $2.50 of the monitoring inspection fee collected for each transportable section of each new manufactured housing unit produced in a manufacturing plant in that State.</P>
              <P>(c) A portion of the monitoring inspection fee collected also shall be distributed by the Secretary or the Secretary's Agent based on the extent of participation of the State in the Joint Team Monitoring Program set out in § 3282.308.</P>
              <P>(d) To assure that a State devotes adequate funds to carry out its State Plan, a State may impose an additional reasonable inspection fee to offset expenses incurred by that State in conducting inspections. Such fee shall not exceed that amount which is the difference between the amount of funds distributed to the State as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and the amount necessary to cover the costs of inspections. Such fee shall be part of the State Plan pursuant to § 3282.302(b) (11) and (12) and shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary pursuant to § 3282.305.</P>
              <P>(e) The Secretary may establish by notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a monitoring inspection fee which is to be paid by manufacturers for each transportable section of each manufactured housing unit manufactured in nonapproved and conditionally approved States as described in § 3282.210. To determine the amount of the inspection fee to be paid for each transportable section of each manufactured home, the Secretary shall divide the (estimated) number of transportable sections of manufactured homes (based on recent industry production figures) into the anticipated aggregate cost of conducting the inspection program in the foreseeable feature. The time period selected for projecting the Department's inspection-related costs and number of transportable sections need not always be the same, but must be for a period of sufficient duration to provide for access to reasonable underlying data. To determine the aggregate cost of conducting the inspection program, the Secretary shall calculate the sum necessary to support:</P>
              <P>(1) Inspection-related activities of State Administrative Agencies;</P>
              <P>(2) Inspection-related activities performed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development;</P>
              <P>(3) Inspection-related activities performed by monitoring inspection contractors;</P>
              <P>(4) Miscellaneous activities involving the performance of inspection-related activities by the Department, including on-site inspections on an ad hoc basis; and</P>
              <P>(5) Maintenance of adequate funds to offset short-term fluctuations in costs that do not warrant revising the fee under the authority of this section.</P>

              <P>(f) The Secretary may at any time revise the amount of the fees established under paragraph (a) or (e) of this section by placing a notice of the amount of the revised fee in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <P>(a) This subpart sets out the requirements which must be met by States or private organizations which wish to qualify as primary inspection agencies under these regulations. It also sets out the various functions which will be carried out by primary inspection agencies.</P>
              <P>(b) There are four basic functions which are performed by primary inspection agencies:</P>
              <P>(1) Approval of the manufacturer's manufactured home design to assure that it is in compliance with the standard;</P>
              <P>(2) Approval of the manufacturer's quality control program to assure that it is compatible with the design;</P>
              <P>(3) Approval of the manufacturer's plant facility and manufacturing process to assure that the manufacturer can perform its approved quality control program and can produce manufactured homes in conformance with its approved design, and</P>
              <P>(4) Performance of ongoing inspections of the manufacturing process in each manufacturing plant to assure that the manufacturer is continuing to perform its approved quality control program and, with respect to those aspects of manufactured homes inspected, is continuing to produce manufactured homes in performance with its approved designs and in conformance with the standards (see § 3282.362(c)(1)).</P>
              <P>(c) There are two types of primary inspection agencies which perform these functions:</P>
              <P>(1) Those which approve designs and quality control programs (Design Approval Primary Inspection Agencies—DAPIAs) and</P>
              <P>(2) Those which approve plants and perform ongoing inspections in the manufacturing plants (Production Inspection Primary Inspection Agencies—IPIAs).</P>
              <P>(d) States and private organizations whose submissions under this subpart are acceptable shall be granted provisional acceptance. Final acceptance shall be conditioned upon adequate performance, which will be determined through monitoring of the actions of the primary inspection agencies. Monitoring of all primary inspection agencies shall be carried out as set out in subpart J. HUD accepted agencies can perform DAPIA functions for any manufacturer in any State and IPIA functions in any State except those in which the State has been approved to act as the exclusive IPIA under § 3282.352.</P>

              <P>(e) Primary inspection agencies approved under this subpart may contract with manufactured home manufacturers (see § 3282.202) to provide the <PRTPAGE P="168"/>services set out in this subpart. Any PIA which charges fees which are excessive in relation to the services rendered shall be subject to disqualification under § 3282.356.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 3282.352</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>State exclusive IPIA functions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Any State which has an approved State Administrative Agency may, if accepted as an IPIA, act as the exclusive IPIA within the State. A State which acts as an IPIA but is not approved as an SAA may not act as the exclusive IPIA in the State. A State which acts as an exclusive IPIA shall be staffed to provide IPIA services to all manufacturers within the state and may not charge unreasonable fees for those services.</P>
              <P>(b) States which wish to act as exclusive IPIAs shall apply for approval to do so in their State plan applications. They shall specify the fees they will charge for IPIA services and shall submit proposed fee revisions to the Secretary prior to instituting any change in fees. If at any time the Secretary finds that those fees are not commensurate with the fees generally being charged for similar services, the Secretary will withhold or revoke approval to act as an exclusive IPIA. States acting as DAPIAs and also as exclusive IPIAs shall establish separate fees for the two functions and shall specify what additional services (such as approval of design changes and full time inspections) these fees cover. As provided in § 3282.302(b)(11), each State shall submit fee schedules for its activities and, where appropriate, the fees presently charged for DAPIA and IPIA services, and any fees charged for DAPIA and IPIA services during the preceding two calendar years.</P>
              <P>(c) A State's status as an exclusive IPIA shall commence upon approval of the State Plan Application and acceptance of the State's submission under § 3282.355. Where a private organization accepted or provisionally accepted as an IPIA under this subpart H is operating in a manufacturing plant within the State on the date the State's status as an exclusive IPIA commences, the private organization may provide IPIA services in that plant for 90 days after that date.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Design Approval Primary Inspection Agency (DAPIA).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) The DAPIA selected by a manufacturer under § 3282.203 shall be responsible for evaluating all manufactured home designs submitted to it by the manufacturer and for assuring that they conform to the standards. It shall also be responsible for evaluating all quality control programs submitted to it by the manufacturer by reviewing the quality assurance manuals in <PRTPAGE P="172"/>which the programs are set out to assure that the manuals reflect programs which are compatible with the designs to be followed and which commit the manufacturer to make adequate inspections and tests of every part of every manufactured home produced.</P>
              <P>(2) A design or quality assurance manual approved by a DAPIA shall be accepted by all IPIAs acting under § 3282.362 who deal with the design, quality assurance manual, or manufactured homes built to them, and by all other parties, as, respectively, being in conformance with the Federal standards or as providing for adequate quality control to assure conformance. However, each design and quality assurance manual is subject to review and verification by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent at any time.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Designs.</E> (1) In evaluating designs for compliance with the standards, the DAPIA will not allow any deviations from accepted engineering practice standards for design calculations or any deviations from accepted test standards, except that the DAPIA, for good cause, may request the Secretary to accept innovations which are not yet accepted practices. Acceptances by the Secretary shall be published in the form of interpretative bulletins, where appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) The DAPIA shall require the manufacturer to submit floor plans and specific information for each manufactured home design or variation which the DAPIA is to evaluate. It shall also require the submission of drawings, specifications, calculations, and test records of the structural, electrical and mechanical systems of each such manufactured home design or variation. The manufacturer need not supply duplicate information where systems are common to several floor plans. Each DAPIA shall develop and carry out procedures for evaluating original manufactured home designs by requiring manufacturers to submit necessary drawings and calculations and carry out such verifications and calculations as it deems necessary. Where compliance with the standards cannot be determined on the basis of drawings and calculations, the DAPIA shall require any necessary tests to be carried out at its own facility, at separate testing facilities or at the manufacturer's plant.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Design deviation report.</E> After evaluating the manufacturer's design, the DAPIA shall furnish the manufacturer with a design deviation report which specifies in detail, item by item with appropriate citations to the standards, the specific deviations in the manufacturer's design which must be rectified in order to produce manufactured homes which comply with the standards. The design deviation report may acknowledge the possibility of alternative designs, tests, listings, and certifications and state the conditions under which they will be acceptable. The design deviation report shall, to the extent practicable, be complete for each design evaluated in order to avoid repeated rejections and additional costs to the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Design approval.</E> The DAPIA shall signify approval of a design by placing its stamp of approval or authorized signature on each drawing and each sheet of test results. The DAPIA shall clearly cross-reference the calculations and test results to applicable drawings. The DAPIA may require the manufacturer to do the cross-referencing if it wishes. It shall indicate on each sheet how any deviations from the standards have been or shall be resolved. Within 5 days after approving a design, the DAPIA shall forward a copy of the design to the manufacturer and the Secretary or the Secretary's agent (prior to the effective date of the standards the latter copy shall go to the Secretary.)</P>
              <FP>The DAPIA shall maintain a complete up-to-date set of approved designs and design changes approved under paragraph (b)(5) of this section which it can duplicate and copies of which it can furnish to interested parties as needed when disputes arise.</FP>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Design change approval.</E> The DAPIA shall also be responsible for approving all changes which a manufacturer wishes to make in a design approved by the DAPIA. In reviewing design changes, the DAPIA shall respond as quickly as possible to avoid disruption of the manufacturing process. Within 5 days after approving a design change, the DAPIA shall forward a <PRTPAGE P="173"/>copy of this change to the manufacturer and the Secretary or the Secretary's agent as set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section to be included in the design to which the change was made.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Quality assurance manuals.</E> (1) In evaluating a quality assurance manual, the DAPIA shall identify any aspects of designs to be manufactured under the manual which require special quality control procedures. The DAPIA shall determine whether the manual under which a particular design is to be manufactured reflects those special procedures, and shall also determine whether the manuals which it evaluates provide for such inspections and testing of each manufactured home so that the manufacturer, by following the manual, can assure that each manufactured home it manufactures will conform to the standards. The manual shall, at a minimum, include the information set out in § 3282.203(c).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Manual deviation report.</E> After evaluating a manufacturer's quality assurance manual, the DAPIA shall furnish the manufacturer with a manual deviation report which specifies in detail any changes which a manufacturer must make in order for the quality assurance manual to be acceptable. The manual deviation report shall, to the extent practicable, be complete for each design in order to avoid repeated rejections and additional costs to the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Manual approval.</E> The DAPIA shall signify approval of the manufacturer's quality assurance manual by placing its stamp of approval or authorized signature on the cover page of the manual. Within 5 days of approving a quality assurance manual, the DAPIA shall forward a copy of the quality assurance manual to the manufacturer and the Secretary or the Secretary's agent (prior to the effective date of the standards, the latter copy shall go to the Secretary). The DAPIA shall maintain a complete up-to-date set of approved manuals and manual changes approved under paragraph (c)(4) of this section which it can duplicate and copies of which it can furnish to interested parties as needed when disputes arise.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Manual change approval.</E> Each change the manufacturer wishes to make in its quality assurance manual must be approved by the DAPIA, and, when subject to § 3282.604, concurred in by the IPIA. Within 5 days after approving a manual change, the DAPIA shall forward a copy of the change to the manufacturer and the Secretary or the Secretary's agent as set out in paragraph (c)(3) of this section to be included in the manual to which the change was made.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Requirements for full acceptance—DAPIA.</E> (1) Before granting full acceptance to a DAPIA, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall review and evaluate at least one complete design and one quality assurance manual which has been approved by the DAPIA. These shall be designs and manuals approved to the Federal standards, and they shall be chosen at random from those approved by the DAPIA during the period of provisional acceptance.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary determines that a design or quality assurance manual shows an inadequate level of performance, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall carry out further evaluations. If the Secretary finds the level of performance to be unacceptable, the Secretary shall not grant full acceptance. If full acceptance has not been granted by the end of the provisional acceptance period, provisional acceptance shall lapse unless the Secretary determines that the failure to obtain full acceptance resulted from the fact that the Secretary or her agent has not had adequate time in which to complete an evaluation.</P>

              <P>(i) That the plant is capable of following the quality control procedures set out in the quality assurance manual to be followed in that plant;</P>

              <P>(ii) That the plant continues to follow the quality assurance manual;<PRTPAGE P="174"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) That any part of any manufactured home that it actually inspects conforms with the design, or where the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the standards, to the standards;</P>
              <P>(iv) That whenever it finds a manufactured home in production which fails to conform to the design or where the design is not specific, to the standards, the failure to conform is corrected before the manufactured home leaves the manufacturing plant; and</P>
              <P>(v) That if a failure to conform to the design, or where the design is not specific, to the standards, is found in one manufactured home, all other homes still in the plant which the IPIA's records or the records of the manufacturer indicate might not conform to the design or to standards are inspected and, if necessary, brought up to the standards before they leave the plant.</P>
              <P>(2) No more than one IPIA shall operate in any one manufacturing plant, except that where a manufacturer decides to change from one IPIA to another, the two may operate in the plant simultaneously for a limited period of time to the extent necessary to assure a smooth transition.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Plant approval.</E> (1) Each IPIA shall, with respect to each manufacturing plant for which it is responsible, evaluate the quality control procedures being followed by the manufacturer in the plant to determine whether those procedures are consistent with and fulfill the procedures set out in the DAPIA approved quality assurance manual being followed in the plant. As part of this evaluation, and prior to the issuance of any labels to the manufacturer, the IPIA shall make a complete inspection of the manufacture of at least one manufactured home through all of the operations in the manufacturer's plant. The purpose of this initial factory inspection is to determine whether the manufacturer is capable of producing manufactured homes in conformance with the approved design and, to the extent the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the standards, with the standards and to determine whether the manufacturer's quality control procedures as set out in the quality assurance manual, plant equipment, and personnel, will assure that such conformance continues. This inspection should be made by one or more qualified engineers who have reviewed the approved design and by an inspector who has been carefully briefed by the engineers on the restrictive aspects of the design. The manufactured home shall be inspected to the approved design for the home except that where the design is not specific with respect to any aspect of the standards, the inspection shall be to the standards as to that aspect of the manufactured home. If the first manufactured home inspected fails to conform to the design or, with respect to any aspect of the standards not specifically covered by the design, to the standards, additional units shall be similarly inspected until the IPIA is satisfied that the manufacturer is conforming to the approved design, or where the design is not specific with respect to any aspect of the standards, to the standards and quality assurance manual.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certification report.</E> If, on the basis of the initial comprehensive factory inspection required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the IPIA determines that the manufacturer is performing adequately, the IPIA shall prepare and forward to the manufacturer, to HUD, and to HUD's agent a certification report as described in this paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The issuance of the certification report is a prerequisite to the commencement of production surveillance under paragraph (c) of this section in the plant for which the report is issued. At the time the certification report is issued, the IPIA may provide the manufacturer with a two to four week supply of labels to be applied to manufactured homes produced in the plant. The IPIA shall maintain a copy of each certification report which it issues.</P>
              <P>(3) The certification report shall include:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of the DAPIA which approved the manufacturer's design and quality assurance manual and the dates of those approvals,</P>

              <P>(ii) The names and titles of the IPIA engineers and inspectors who performed the initial comprehensive inspection,<PRTPAGE P="175"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) A full report of inspections made, serial numbers inspected, any failures to comply which were observed, corrective actions taken, and dates of inspections, and</P>
              <P>(iv) A certification that at least one manufactured home has been completely inspected in all phases of its production in the plant, that the manufacturer is performing in conformance with the approved designs and quality assurance manual and, to the extent the design is not specific with respect to any aspects of the standards, with the standards, and the IPIA is satisfied that the manufacturer can produce manufactured homes in conformance with the designs, and where the designs are not specific, with the standards on a continuing basis.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Inadequate manufacturer performance.</E> Where an IPIA determines that the performance of a manufacturer is not yet adequate to justify the issuance of a certification report and labels to the manufacturer, the IPIA may label manufactured homes itself by using such of its personnel as it deems necessary to perform complete inspections of all phases of production of each manufactured home being produced and labeling only those determined after any necessary corrections to be in conformance with the design and, as appropriate, with the standards. This procedure shall continue until the IPIA determines that the manufacturer's performance is adequate to justify the issuance of a certification report.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Production surveillance.</E> (1) After it has issued a certification report under paragraph (b) of this section, the IPIA shall carry out ongoing surveillance of the manufacturing process in the plant. The IPIA shall be responsible for conducting representative inspections to assure that the manufacturer is performing its quality control program pursuant to and consistent with its approved quality assurance manual and to assure that whatever part of a manufactured home is actually inspected by the IPIA is fully in conformance with the design and, as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, with the standards before a label is issued for or placed on that manufactured home. The surveillance visits shall commence no later than that date on which the IPIA determines they must commence so that the IPIA can assure that every manufactured home to be produced after the effective date of the standards to which a label provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is affixed, is inspected in at least one stage of its production. The frequency of subsequent visits to the plant shall continue to be such that every manufactured home is inspected at some stage in its production. In the course of each visit, the IPIA shall make a complete inspection of every phase of production and of every visible part of every manufactured home which is at each stage of production. The inspection shall be made to the approved design except where the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the standards, in which case the inspection of that aspect of the manufactured home shall be made to the standards. The IPIA shall assure that no label is placed on any manufactured home which it finds fails to conform with the approved design or, as appropriate, the standards in the course of these inspections and shall assure that no labels are placed on other manufactured homes still in the plant which may also not conform until those homes are inspected and if necessary corrected to the design or the standards. If an IPIA finds a manufactured home that fails to conform to the design, or as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, to the standards, the IPIA may, in addition to withholding the label for the unit, proceed to red tag the home until the failure to conform is corrected. Only the IPIA is authorized to remove a red tag. When manufactured homes repeatedly fail to conform to the design, or as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, to the standards in the same assembly station or when there is evidence that the manufacturer is ignoring or not performing under its approved quality assurance manual, the IPIA shall increase the frequency of these inspections until it is satisfied that the manufacturer is performing to its approved quality assurance manual. Failure to perform to the approved manual justifies withholding labels until an adequate level of performance <PRTPAGE P="176"/>is attained. As part of its function of assuring quality control, the IPIA shall inspect materials in storage and test equipment used by the manufacturer at least once a month, and more frequently if unacceptable conditions are observed. With the prior approval of the Secretary, an IPIA may decrease the frequency of any inspections.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Labeling</E>—(i) <E T="03">Labels required.</E> (A) The IPIA shall continuously provide the manufacturer with a two- to four-week supply (at the convenience of the IPIA and the manufacturer) of the labels described in this subsection, except that no labels shall be issued for use when the IPIA is not present if the IPIA is not satisfied that the manufacturer can and is producing manufactured homes which conform to the design and, as appropriate, to the standards. Where necessary, the IPIA shall reclaim labels already given to the manufacturer. In no event shall the IPIA allow a label to be affixed to a manufactured home if the IPIA believes that the manufactured home fails to conform to the design, or, where the design is not specific with respect to an aspect of the standards, to the standards. Labels for such manufactured homes shall be provided only after the failure to conform has been remedied, or after the Secretary has determined that there is no failure to conform.</P>
              <P>(B) A permanent label shall be affixed to each transportable section of each manufactured home for sale or lease to a purchaser or lessor in the United States in such a manner that removal will damage the label so that it cannot be reused. This label is provided by the IPIA and is separate and distinct from the data plate that the manufacturer is required to provide under § 3280.5.</P>
              <P>(C) The label shall read as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“As evidenced by this label No. ABC 000 001, the manufacturer certifies to the best of the manufacturer's knowledge and belief that this manufactured home has been inspected in accordance with the requirements of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in effect on the date of manufacture. See data plate.”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(D) The label shall be 2 in. by 4 in. in size and shall be permanently attached to the manufactured home by means of 4 blind rivets, drive screws, or other means that render it difficult to remove without defacing it. It shall be etched on .032 in. thick aluminum plate. The label number shall be etched or stamped with a 3 letter IPIA designation which the Secretary shall assign and a 6 digit number which the label supplier shall stamp sequentially on labels supplied to each IPIA.</P>
              <P>(E) The label shall be located at the tail-light end of each transportable section of the manufactured home approximately one foot up from the floor and one foot in from the road side, or as near that location on a permanent part of the exterior of the manufactured home as practicable. The roadside is the right side of the manufactured home when one views the manufactured home from the tow bar end of the manufactured home. It shall be applied to the manufactured home unit in the manufacturing plant by the manufacturer or the IPIA, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(F) The label shall be provided to the manufacturer only by the IPIA. The IPIA shall provide the labels in sequentially numbered series. The IPIA may obtain labels from the Secretary or the Secretary's agent, or where the IPIA obtains the prior approval of the Secretary, from a label manufacturer. However, if the IPIA obtains labels directly from a label supplier, those labels must be sequentially numbered without any duplication of label numbers.</P>

              <P>(G) Whenever the IPIA determines that a manufactured home which has been labeled, but which has not yet been released by the manufacturer may not conform to the design or, as appropriate under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, to the standards, the IPIA by itself or through an agent shall red tag the manufactured home. Where the IPIA determines that a manufactured home which has been labeled and released by the manufacturer, but not yet sold to a purchaser (as described in § 3282.252(b)) may not conform, the IPIA may, in its discretion, proceed to red tag the manufactured home. Only the IPIA is authorized to remove red tags, though it may do so through agents <PRTPAGE P="177"/>which it deems qualified to determine that the failure to conform has been corrected. Red tags may be removed when the IPIA is satisfied, through inspections, assurances from the manufacturer, or otherwise, that the affected homes conform.</P>
              <P>(H) Labels that are damaged, destroyed, or otherwise made illegible or removed shall be replaced by the IPIA, after determination that the manufactured home is in compliance with the standards, by a new label of a different serial number. The IPIA's labeling record shall be permanently marked with the number of the replacement label and a corresponding record of the replacement label.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Label control.</E> The labels used in each plant shall be under the direct control of the IPIA acting in that plant. Only the IPIA shall provide the labels to the manufacturer. The IPIA shall assure that the manufacturer does not use any other label to indicate conformance to the standards.</P>
              <P>(A) The IPIA shall be responsible for obtaining labels. Labels shall be obtained from HUD or its agent, or with the approval of the Secretary, from a label manufacturer. The labels shall meet the requirements of this section. Where the IPIA obtains labels directly from a label manufacturer, the IPIA shall be responsible for assuring that the label manufacturer does not provide labels directly to the manufacturer of manufactured homes. If the label manufacturer fails to supply correct labels or allows labels to be released to parties other than the IPIA, the IPIA shall cease dealing with the label manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(B) The labels shall be shipped to and stored by the IPIA's at a location which permits ready access to manufacturing plants under its surveillance. The labels shall be stored under strict security and inventory control. They shall be released only by the IPIA to the manufacturer under these regulations.</P>
              <P>(C) The IPIA shall be able to account for all labels which it has obtained through the date on which the manufactured home leaves the manufacturing plant, and it shall be able to identify the serial number of the manufactured home to which each particular label is affixed.</P>
              <P>(D) The IPIA shall keep in its central record office a list of the serial numbers of labels issued from the label producer to the IPIA and by the IPIA to the manufacturing plant.</P>
              <P>(E) Failure to maintain control of labels through the date the manufactured home leaves the manufacturing plant and failure to keep adequate records of which label is on which manufactured home shall render the IPIA subject to disqualification under § 3282.356.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Data plate.</E> (i) The IPIA shall assure that each manufactured home produced in each manufacturing plant under its surveillance is supplied with a data plate which meets the requirements of this section and of § 3280.5 of chapter XX of 24 CFR. The data plate shall be furnished by the manufacturer and affixed inside the manufactured home on or near the main electrical distribution panel. The data plate shall contain the following information:</P>
              <P>(A) The name and address of the manufacturing plant in which the manufactured home was manufactured,</P>
              <P>(B) The serial number and model designation of the unit and the date the unit was manufactured,</P>
              <P>(C) The statement “This manufactured home is designed to comply with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards in force at the time of manufacture.”,</P>
              <P>(D) A list of major factory-installed equipment including the manufacturer's name and the model designation of each appliance,</P>

              <P>(E) Reference to the roof load zone and wind load zone for which the home is designed and duplicates of the maps as set forth in § 3280.305. This information may be combined with the heating/cooling certificate and insulation zone map required by §§ 3280.510 and 3280.511. The Wind Zone Map on the Data Plate shall also contain the statement:

For homes designed to be located in Wind Zones II and III, which have not been provided with shutters or equivalent covering devices, it is strongly recommended that the home be made ready to be equipped with these devices in accordance with the method recommended in the manufacturers printed instructions.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(G) The statement: “Design Approval by”, followed by the name of the agency that approved the design.</P>
              <P>(ii) A copy of the data plate shall be furnished to the IPIA, and the IPIA shall keep a permanent record of the data plate as part of its labeling record so that the information is available during the life of the manufactured home in case the data plate in the manufactured home is defaced or destroyed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Permanent records.</E> The IPIA shall maintain the following records as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(1) Records of all labels issued, applied, removed, and replaced by label number, manufactured home serial number, manufactured home type, manufacturer's name, retailer destination, and copies of corresponding data plates.</P>
              <P>(2) Records of all manufactured homes which are red tagged, and the status of each home.</P>
              <P>(3) Records of all inspections made at each manufacturing plant on each manufactured home serial number, each failure to conform found, and the action taken in each case.</P>
              <P>(4) Records of all inspections made at other locations of manufactured homes identified by manufacturer and serial number, all manufactured homes believed to contain the same failure to conform, and the action taken in each case.</P>
              <FP>All records shall specify the precise section of the standard which is in question and contain a clear and concise explanation of the process by which the IPIA reached any conclusions. All records shall be traceable to specific manufactured home serial numbers and through the manufacturer's records to retailers and purchasers.</FP>
              <P>(5) Records of all site inspections made as required under procedures applicable to approval of AC or on-site completion pursuant to §§ 3282.14 or 3282.610.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Requirements for full acceptance—IPIA.</E> (1) Before granting full acceptance to an IPIA, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall review and evaluate at least one certification report which has been prepared by the IPIA during the period of provisional acceptance. The Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall also review in depth the IPIA's administrative capabilities and otherwise review the IPIA's performance of its responsibilities under these regulations.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the Secretary determines on the basis of these reviews that an IPIA is not meeting an adequate level of performance, the Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall carry out further evaluations. If the Secretary finds the level of performance to be unacceptable, the Secretary shall not grant full acceptance. If full acceptance has not been granted by the end of the provisional acceptance period, provisional acceptance shall lapse unless the Secretary determines that the failure to obtain full acceptance resulted from the fact that the Secretary or the Secretary's agent has not had adequate time in which to complete an evaluation.</P>

              <P>(i) Forward the complaint or information to the manufacturer of the home in question as early as possible; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Send a copy of the complaint or other information to the SAA of the State where the manufactured home was manufactured or to the Secretary if there is no such SAA.</P>
              <P>(2) When it appears from the complaint or other information that an imminent safety hazard or serious defect may be involved, the SAA of the State where the home was manufactured must also send a copy of the complaint or other information to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Manufacturer responsibilities.</E> Whenever the manufacturer receives information from any source that the manufacturer believes in good faith relates to a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard in any of its manufactured homes, the manufacturer must, for each such occurrence, make the determinations required by § 3282.404.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Manufacturers' determinations and related concurrences.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial determination.</E> (1) Not later than 30 days after a manufacturer receives information that it believes in good faith may indicate a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the manufacturer must make a specific initial determination that there is a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, or that the information requires no further action under this subpart. If a manufacturer makes a final determination of noncompliance for an individual home (see § 3282.412(b)) and a class of homes is not involved, no further action is needed by the manufacturer other than to keep a record of its determination as required by § 3282.417. If the manufacturer determines that it is not the cause of the problem, but a problem still exists, the manufacturer must forward the information in its possession to the appropriate retailer (see § 3282.254), and, if known, to the installer (see §§ 3286.115 and 3286.811) for their consideration. Alternatively, the manufacturer, retailer, or installer may choose to submit the issue for resolution under dispute resolution (see 24 CFR part 3288).</P>
              <P>(2) When a manufacturer makes an initial determination that there is a serious defect or an imminent safety hazard, the manufacturer must immediately notify the Secretary, the SAA in the state of manufacture, and the manufacturer's IPIA.</P>

              <P>(3) In making the determination of noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, or that no further action is required under this subpart, the manufacturer must review the information it received and carry out investigations, including, a review of service records, IPIA inspection records, and, as appropriate, inspections of homes in the class. The manufacturer must review the information, the known facts, and the circumstances relating to the complaint or information, including service records, approved designs, and audit findings, as applicable, to decide what investigations are reasonable.<PRTPAGE P="181"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Class determination.</E> (1) When the manufacturer makes an initial determination of defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the manufacturer must also make a good-faith determination of the class that includes each manufactured home in which the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists. Multiple occurrences of defects may be considered the same defect if they have the same cause, are related to a specific workstation description, or are related to the same failure to follow the manufacturer's approved quality assurance manual. Good faith may be used as a defense to the imposition of a penalty, but does not relieve the manufacturer of its responsibilities for notification or correction under this subpart I. The manufacturer must make this class determination not later than 20 days after making a determination of defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (c) of this section sets out methods for a manufacturer to use in determining the class of manufactured homes. If the manufacturer can identify the precise manufactured homes affected by the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, the class of manufactured homes may include only those manufactured homes actually affected by the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard. The manufacturer is also permitted to exclude from the class those manufactured homes for which the manufacturer has information that indicates the homes were not affected by the same cause. If it is not possible to identify the precise manufactured homes affected, the class must include every manufactured home in the group of homes that is identifiable, since the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists in some homes in that group of manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes related to this section, a defect, a serious defect, or an imminent safety hazard likely exists in a manufactured home if the cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard is such that the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard would likely have been introduced systematically into more than one manufactured home. Indications that the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard would likely have been introduced systematically may include, but are not limited to, complaints that can be traced to the same faulty design or faulty construction, problems known to exist in supplies of components or parts, information related to the performance of a particular employee or use of a particular process, and information signaling a failure to follow quality control procedures with respect to a particular aspect of the manufactured home.</P>
              <P>(4) If the manufacturer must determine the class of homes pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer must obtain from the IPIA, and the IPIA must provide, either:</P>

              <P>(ii) The IPIA's written statement explaining why it believes the manufacturer's methods for determining the class of homes were inappropriate or inadequate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Methods for determining class.</E> (1) In making a class determination under paragraph (b) of this section, a manufacturer is responsible for carrying out reasonable investigations. In carrying out investigations, the manufacturer must review the information, the known facts, and the relevant circumstances, and generally must establish the cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard. Based on the results of such investigations and all information received or developed, the manufacturer must use an appropriate method or appropriate methods to determine the class of manufactured homes in which the same defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists.</P>
              <P>(2) Methods that may be used in determining the class of manufactured homes include, but are not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Inspection of the manufactured home in question, including its design, to determine whether the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard resulted from the design itself;</P>

              <P>(ii) Physical inspection of manufactured homes of the same design or construction, as appropriate, that were <PRTPAGE P="182"/>produced before and after a home in question;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inspection of the service records of a home in question and of homes of the same design or construction, as appropriate, produced before and after that home, if it is clear that the cause of the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard is such that the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard would be visible to and reportable by consumers or retailers;</P>
              <P>(iv) Inspection of manufacturer quality control records to determine whether quality control procedures were followed and, if not, the time frame during which they were not;</P>
              <P>(v) Inspection of IPIA records to determine whether the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard was either detected or specifically found not to exist in some manufactured homes;</P>
              <P>(vi) Identification of the cause as relating to a particular employee whose work, or to a process whose use, would have been common to the production of the manufacturer's homes for a period of time; and</P>
              <P>(vii) Inspection of records relating to components supplied by other parties and known to contain or suspected of containing a defect, a serious defect, or an imminent safety hazard.</P>
              <P>(3) When the Secretary or an SAA decides the method chosen by the manufacturer to conduct an investigation in order to make a class determination is not the most appropriate method, the Secretary or SAA must explain in writing to the manufacturer why the chosen method is not the most appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Documentation required.</E> The manufacturer must comply with the recordkeeping requirements in § 3282.417 as applicable to its determinations and any IPIA concurrence or statement that it does not concur.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements by category.</E> (1) <E T="03">Noncompliance.</E> A manufacturer must provide notification of a noncompliance only when ordered to do so by the Secretary or an SAA, pursuant to §§ 3282.412 and 3282.413.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Defects.</E> When a manufacturer has made a class determination in accordance with § 3282.404 that a defect exists or likely exists in more than one home, the manufacturer must prepare a plan for notification in accordance with § 3282.408, and must provide notification with respect to each manufactured home in the class of manufactured homes.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Serious defects and imminent safety hazards.</E> When a manufacturer has made an initial determination in accordance with § 3282.404(a) that a serious defect or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists, the manufacturer must prepare a plan for notification in accordance with § 3282.408, must provide notification with respect to all manufactured homes in which the serious defect or imminent safety hazard exists or likely exists, and must correct the home or homes in accordance with § 3282.406.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Plan for notification required.</E> (1) If a manufacturer determines that it is responsible for providing notification under this section, the manufacturer must prepare and receive approval on a plan for notification as set out in § 3282.408, unless the manufacturer meets alternative requirements established in § 3282.407.</P>

              <P>(1) By certified mail or other more expeditious means that provides a receipt to each retailer or distributor to whom any manufactured home in the class of homes containing the defect, <PRTPAGE P="183"/>serious defect, or imminent safety hazard was delivered;</P>
              <P>(2) By certified mail or other more expeditious means that provides a receipt to the first purchaser of each manufactured home in the class of manufactured homes containing the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard, and, to the extent feasible, to any subsequent owner to whom any warranty provided by the manufacturer or required by federal, state, or local law on such manufactured home has been transferred, except that notification need not be sent to any person known by the manufacturer not to own the manufactured home in question if the manufacturer has a record of a subsequent owner of the manufactured home; and</P>
              <P>(3) By certified mail or other more expeditious means that provides a receipt to each other person who is a registered owner of a manufactured home in the class of homes containing the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard and whose name has been ascertained pursuant to § 3282.211 or is known to the manufacturer.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Required manufacturer correction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Correction of noncompliances and defects.</E> (1) Section 3282.415 sets out requirements with respect to a manufacturer's correction of any noncompliance or defect that exists in each manufactured home that has been sold or otherwise released to a retailer but that has not yet been sold to a purchaser.</P>
              <P>(2) In accordance with section 623 of the Act and Part 3288, “Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program,” of this chapter, the manufacturer, retailer, or installer of a manufactured home deemed responsible for correction of repairs or defects must correct, at its expense, each failure in the performance, construction, components, or material of the home that renders the home or any part of the home not fit for the ordinary use for which it was intended and that is reported during the one-year period beginning on the date of installation of the home (see § 3286.115).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Correction of serious defects and imminent safety hazards.</E> (1) A manufacturer required to furnish notification under § 3282.405 or § 3282.413 must correct, at its expense, any serious defect or imminent safety hazard that can be related to an error in design or assembly of the manufactured home by the manufacturer, including an error in design or assembly of any component or system incorporated into the manufactured home by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(2) If, while making corrections under any of the provisions of this subpart, the manufacturer creates an imminent safety hazard or serious defect, the manufacturer shall correct the imminent safety hazard or serious defect.</P>
              <P>(3) Each serious defect or imminent safety hazard corrected under this paragraph (b) must be brought into compliance with applicable construction and safety standards or, where those standards are not specific, with the manufacturer's approved design.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Inclusion in plan.</E> (1) In the plan required by § 3282.408, the manufacturer must provide for correction of those homes that are required to be corrected pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary or SAA orders a manufacturer to provide correction in accordance with the procedures in § 3282.413, the Secretary or SAA has the option of requiring a manufacturer to prepare and receive approval on a plan for correction.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Corrections by owners.</E> A manufacturer that is required to make corrections under paragraph (b) of this section, or that elects to make corrections in accordance with § 3282.407, must reimburse any owner of an affected manufactured home who choses to make the correction before the manufacturer did so, for the reasonable cost of correction.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Correction of appliances, components, or systems.</E> (1) If any appliance, component, or system in a manufactured home is covered by a product warranty, the manufacturer, retailer, or installer that is responsible under this section for correcting a noncompliance, defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard in the appliance, component, or system may seek the required correction directly from the producer. The SAA that approves <PRTPAGE P="184"/>any plan of notification required pursuant to § 3282.408 or the Secretary, as applicable, may establish reasonable time limits for the manufacturer of the home and the producer of the appliance, component, or system to agree on who is to make the correction and for completing the correction.</P>
              <P>(2) Nothing in this section shall prevent the manufacturer, retailer, or installer from seeking indemnification from the producer of the appliance, component, or system for correction work done on any appliance, component, or system.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Voluntary compliance with the notification and correction requirements under the Act.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A manufacturer that takes corrective action that complies with one of the following three alternatives to the requirement in § 3282.408 for preparing a plan will be deemed to have provided any notification required by § 3282.405:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Voluntary action—one home.</E> When a manufacturer has made a determination that only one manufactured home is involved, the manufacturer is not required to provide notification pursuant to § 3282.405 or to prepare or submit a plan if:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer has made a determination of defect; or</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer has made a determination of serious defect or imminent safety hazard and corrects the home within the 20-day period. The manufacturer must maintain, in the plant where the manufactured home was manufactured, a complete record of the correction. The record must describe briefly the facts of the case and any known cause of the serious defect or imminent safety hazard, state what corrective actions were taken, and be maintained in the service records in a form that will allow the Secretary or an SAA to review all such corrections.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Voluntary action—multiple homes.</E> Regardless of whether a plan has been submitted under § 3282.408, the manufacturer may act prior to obtaining approval of the plan. Such action is subject to review and disapproval by the SAA of the state where the home was manufactured or by the Secretary, unless the manufacturer obtains the written agreement of the SAA or the Secretary that the corrective action is adequate. If such an agreement is obtained, the correction must be accepted as adequate by all SAAs and the Secretary, if the manufacturer makes the correction as agreed to and any imminent safety hazard or serious defect is eliminated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> (1) A manufacturer may obtain a waiver of the notification requirements in § 3282.405 and the plan requirements in § 3282.408 either from the SAA of the state of manufacture, when all of the manufactured homes that would be covered by the plan were manufactured in that state, or from the Secretary. As of the date of a request for a waiver, the notification and plan requirements are deferred pending timely submission of any additional documentation as the SAA or the Secretary may require and final resolution of the waiver request. If a waiver request is not granted, the plan required by § 3282.408 must be submitted within 5 days after the expiration of the time frame established in § 3282.408, if the manufacturer is notified that the request was not granted.</P>
              <P>(2) The waiver may be approved if, not later than 20 days after making the determination that notification is required, the manufacturer presents evidence that it, in good faith, believes would show to the satisfaction of the SAA or the Secretary that:</P>
              <P>(i) The manufacturer has identified all homes that would be covered by the plan in accordance with § 3282.408;</P>
              <P>(ii) The manufacturer will correct, at its expense, all of the identified homes, either within 60 days of being informed that the request for waiver has been granted or within another time limit approved in the waiver;</P>
              <P>(iii) The proposed repairs are adequate to remove the defect, serious defect, or imminent safety hazard that gave rise to the determination that correction is required; and</P>

              <P>(3) The manufacturer must correct all affected manufactured homes within 60 days of being informed that the request for waiver has been granted or within the time limit approved in the waiver, as applicable. The manufacturer must record the known cause of the problem and the correction in the service records, in an approved form <PRTPAGE P="185"/>that will allow the Secretary or SAA to review the cause and correction.</P>

              <P>The actions of all primary inspection agencies accepted under subpart H shall be monitored by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent to determine whether the PIAs are fulfilling their <PRTPAGE P="194"/>responsibilities under these regulations. This monitoring shall be carried out primarily through joint monitoring teams made up of personnel supplied by SAAs and by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent. Monitoring parties shall make recommendations to the Secretary with respect to final acceptance of PIAs under §§ 3282.361(e) and 3282.362(e), continued acceptance, and disqualification or requalification under § 3282.356, and with respect to any changes which PIAs should make in their operations in order to continue to be approved. Based on this monitoring, the Secretary shall determine whether PIAs should continue to be approved under these regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Participation in monitoring.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Joint monitoring teams.</E> (1) The Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall develop and coordinate joint monitoring teams which shall be made up of qualified personnel provided by SAAs and by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent. The Secretary or the Secretary's agent shall determine whether personnel are qualified based on education or experience.</P>
              <P>(2) The joint monitoring teams will operate generally on a regional basis. To the extent possible, the teams shall be so scheduled that personnel provided by an SAA will be monitoring operations in manufactured home plants from which manufactured homes are shipped into their State.</P>
              <P>(3) Personnel from an SAA shall not participate on joint monitoring teams operating within their State.</P>
              <P>(4) States are encouraged but not required to participate on joint monitoring teams.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State monitoring.</E> A State may carry out monitoring of IPIA functions at plant facilities within the State if the State is not acting as an IPIA. Where a State wishes to carry out monitoring activities it shall do so in coordination with the Secretary and the Secretary's agent. To the extent that the State is performing adequate monitoring, the frequency of the joint team monitoring may be reduced to one visit per year consistent with the requirements of § 3282.453.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of staff capability.</E> The monitoring party shall review the capability of the PIA's staff to perform the functions it is required to perform.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review of interpretations.</E> The monitoring party shall review all records of interpretations of the standards made by the PIA to determine whether they are consistent and to determine whether there are any conflicts which should be referred to the Secretary for determination.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">DAPIA.</E> Monitoring parties shall review on a random basis at least 10 percent of the design and quality assurance manual approvals made by each DAPIA in each year.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">IPIA.</E> The monitoring parties shall assure that the IPIAs are carrying out all of the functions for which they have been accepted. In particular, they shall assure that the manufacturing process is as stated in the certification reports, that the IPIAs are carrying out the required number of inspections, that inspections are effective, and that the IPIAs are maintaining complete label control as required by § 3282.362. A monitoring team shall monitor the IPIA's office procedures, files, and label control and the monitoring team shall send copies of its report to the Secretary or the Secretary's agent, which shall send copies to all monitoring teams which monitor the operations of the subject IPIA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Remedial actions.</E> The monitoring parties shall review the remedial action records of the manufacturers and of the primary inspection agencies closely to determine whether the primary inspection agencies have been carrying out their responsibilities with respect to remedial actions.</P>

              <P>(a) The actions of all primary inspection agencies shall be monitored at a frequency adequate to assure that they are performing consistently and fulfilling their responsibilities under these regulations. Every aspect of the primary inspection agencies' performance shall be monitored.</P>

              <P>(b) Frequency of monitoring. The performance of each primary inspection agency shall be monitored during its period of provisional acceptance by a complete review of its records and, in <PRTPAGE P="195"/>the case of IPAs, by a complete inspection of the operations of at least one manufacturing plant which it has approved or in which it is operating. After the initial inspection, the performance of each primary inspection agency shall be monitored four times per year, except that the number of monitoring visits may be decreased to a minimum of one per year if the performance of the primary inspection agency is deemed by the Secretary or the Secretary's agent to be superior, and it may be increased as necessary if performance is suspect. There shall be a minimum of one review per year of the records of each primary inspection agency, and there shall be more reviews as needed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Construction qualifying for on-site completion.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The manufacturer, the manufacturer's DAPIA acting on behalf of HUD, and the manufacturer's IPIA acting on behalf of HUD may agree to permit certain aspects of construction of a manufactured home to be completed to the Construction and Safety Standards on-site in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. The aspects of construction that may be approved to be completed on-site are the partial completion of structural assemblies or systems (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> electrical, plumbing, heating, cooling, fuel burning, and fire safety systems) and components built as an integral part of the home, when the partial completion on-site is warranted because completion of the partial structural assembly or system during the manufacturing process in the factory would not be practicable (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> because of the home design or which could result in transportation damage <PRTPAGE P="197"/>or if precluded because of road restrictions). Examples of construction that may be completed on-site include:</P>
              <P>(1) Hinged roof and eave construction, unless exempted as installation by § 3285.801(f) of the Model Manufactured Home Installation Standards and completed and inspected in accordance with the Manufactured Home Installation Program;</P>
              <P>(2) Any work required by the home design that cannot be completed in the factory, or when the manufacturer authorizes the retailer to provide an add-on, not including an attached garage, to the home during installation, when that work would take the home out of conformance with the construction and safety standards and then bring it back into conformance;</P>
              <P>(3) Appliances provided by the manufacturer, installer, retailer, or purchaser, including fireplaces to be installed on site;</P>
              <P>(4) Components or parts that are shipped loose with the manufactured home and that will be installed on-site, unless exempted as installation by the installation standards;</P>
              <P>(5) Exterior applications such as brick siding, stucco, or tile roof systems; and</P>
              <P>(6) Other construction such as roof extensions (dormers), site-installed windows in roofs, removable or open floor sections for basement stairs, and sidewall bay windows.</P>
              <P>(b) The manufacturer or a licensed contractor or similarly qualified professional with prior authorization from the manufacturer may perform the on-site work in accordance with the DAPIA approvals and site completion instructions. However, the manufacturer is responsible for the adequacy of all on-site completion work regardless of who does the work, and must prepare and provide all site inspection reports, as well as the certification of completion, and must fulfill all of its responsibilities and maintain all records at the factory of origin as required by § 3282.609.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 3285.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Administration.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope.</E> These Model Installation Standards provide minimum requirements for the initial installation of new manufactured homes, in accordance with section 605 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5404). The Model Installation Standards are one component of the Manufactured Home Installation Program in Part 3286 of this chapter, upon effect, and serve as the basis for developing the manufacturers' installation instructions required by § 3285.2 of this subpart. The manufacturer's installation instructions, including specific methods for performing a specific operation or assembly, will be deemed to comply with these Model Installation Standards, provided they meet or exceed the minimum requirements of these Model Installation Standards and do not take the home out of compliance with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (24 CFR part 3280). Work necessary to join all sections of a multi-section home specifically identified in Subparts G, H, and I of this part, or work associated with connecting exterior lights, chain-hung light fixtures, or ceiling-suspended fans, as specifically identified in Subpart I, is not considered assembly or construction of the home, although the design of those elements of a manufactured home must comply with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (MHCSS). However, work associated with the completion of hinged roofs and eaves in § 3285.801 and other work done on-site and not specifically identified in this part as close-up is considered construction and assembly and is subject to the requirements of the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (24 CFR part 3280) and the Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282).</P>

              <P>(1) States that choose to operate an installation program for manufactured homes in lieu of the federal program must implement installation standards that provide protection to its residents that equals or exceeds the protection provided by these Model Installation Standards.<PRTPAGE P="205"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) In states that do not choose to operate their own installation program for manufactured homes, these Model Installation Standards serve as the minimum standards for manufactured home installations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The standards set forth herein have been established to accomplish certain basic objectives and are not to be construed as relieving manufacturers, retailers, installers, or other parties of responsibility for compliance with other applicable ordinances, codes, regulations, and laws. The manufactured homes covered by this standard must comply with requirements of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) MHCSS Program, as set forth in 24 CFR part 3280, Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, and 24 CFR part 3282, Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations, as well as with, upon effect, the Manufactured Home Installation Program, 24 CFR part 3286, and the Dispute Resolution Program, 24 CFR part 3288. The requirements of this part do not apply to homes installed on site-built permanent foundations when the manufacturer certifies the home in accordance with § 3282.12 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation with the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee.</E> The Secretary will seek input from the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC) when revising the installation standards in this part 3285. Before publication of a proposed rule to revise the installation standards, the Secretary will provide the MHCC with a 120-day opportunity to comment on such revision. The MHCC may send to the Secretary any of the MHCC's own recommendations to adopt new installation standards or to modify or repeal any of the installation standards in this part. Along with each recommendation, the MHCC must set forth pertinent data and arguments in support of the action sought. The Secretary will either:</P>
              <P>(1) Accept or modify the recommendation and publish it for public comment in accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), along with an explanation of the reasons for any such modification; or</P>
              <P>(2) Reject the recommendation entirely, and provide to the MHCC a written explanation of the reasons for the rejection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Manufacturer installation instructions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Instructions required.</E> A manufacturer must provide with each new manufactured home, installation designs and instructions that have been approved by the Secretary or DAPIA. The approved installation instructions must include all topics covered in the Model Installation Standards for the installation of manufactured homes. These installation instructions and any variations thereto that are prepared to comply with paragraph (c) of this section must provide protection to residents of the manufactured homes that equals or exceeds the protection provided by these Model Installation Standards and must not take the manufactured home out of compliance with the MHCSS. These instructions must insure that each home will be supported and anchored in a manner that is capable of meeting or exceeding the design loads required by the MHCSS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Professional engineer or registered architect certification.</E> A professional engineer or registered architect must prepare and certify that the manufacturer's installation instructions meet or exceed the Model Installation Standards for foundation support and anchoring whenever:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer's installation instructions do not conform in their entirety to the minimum requirements or tables or their conditions for foundation support and anchoring of this Standard; or</P>
              <P>(2) An alternative foundation system or anchoring system is employed, including designs for basements and perimeter support foundation systems, whether or not it is included in the installation instructions; or</P>
              <P>(3) Materials such as metal piers or alternatives to concrete footing materials are required by the installation instructions; or</P>

              <P>(4) Foundation support and anchoring systems are designed for use in areas subject to freezing or for use in areas subject to flood damage or high seismic risk; or<PRTPAGE P="206"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) Foundations support and anchoring systems are designed to be used in special snow load conditions or in severe wind design areas; or</P>
              <P>(6) Site conditions do not allow the use of the manufacturer's installation instructions; or</P>
              <P>(7) There are any other circumstances in which the manufacturer's installation instructions would not permit the home to be installed in conformance with the Installation Standards or the MHCSS.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Variations to installation instructions.</E> (1) Before an installer provides support or anchorage that are different than those methods specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions, or when the installer encounters site or other conditions (such as areas that are subject to flood damage or high seismic risk) that prevent the use of the instructions, the installer must:</P>
              <P>(i) First attempt to obtain DAPIA-approved designs and instructions prepared by the manufacturer; or</P>
              <P>(ii) If designs and instructions are not available from the manufacturer, obtain an alternate design prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer or registered architect for the support and anchorage of the manufactured home that is consistent with the manufactured home design, conforms to the requirements of the MHCSS, and has been approved by the manufacturer and the DAPIA.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer's installation instructions must include an explanation of the requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Installer certification.</E> In making the certification of the installation required under part 3286 of this chapter, upon effect, an installer must certify that it completed the installation in compliance with either the manufacturer's instructions or with an alternate installation design and instructions that have been prepared by the manufacturer or prepared in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Temporary storage.</E> The installation instructions must provide at least one method for temporarily supporting each transportable section of a manufactured home, to prevent structural and other damage to the structure, when those section(s) are temporarily sited at the manufacturer's facility, retailer's lot, or the home site.</P>

                <P>Torque Probe Method for determining soil classification: This kit contains a 5-foot long steel earth-probe rod, with a helix at the end. It resembles a wood-boring bit on a larger scale. The tip of the probe is inserted as deep as the bottom helix of the ground anchor assembly that is being considered for installation. The torque wrench is placed on the top of the probe. The torque wrench is used to rotate the probe steadily so one can read the scale on the wrench. If the torque wrench reads 551 inch-pounds or greater, then a Class 2 soil is present according to the Table to 24 CFR 3285.202(a)(3). A Class 3 soil is from 351 to 550 inch-pounds. A Class 4A soil is from 276 to 350 inch-pounds, and a Class 4B soil is from 175 to 275 inch-pounds. When the torque wrench reading is below 175 inch-pounds, a professional engineer should be consulted.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimum elements.</E> To be accepted as a fully qualifying installation program, a state installation program must include the following elements:</P>
              <P>(1) Installation standards that meet or exceed the requirements of § 3286.107(a) and that apply to every initial installation of a new manufactured home within the state;</P>
              <P>(2) The training of manufactured home installers;</P>
              <P>(3) The licensing of, or other method of certifying or approving, manufactured home installers to perform the initial installations of new manufactured homes in the state;</P>
              <P>(4) A method for inspecting the initial installations of new manufactured homes in the state that is implemented and used to hold installers responsible for the work they perform; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditional acceptance.</E> (1) A state installation program that meets the minimum requirements set forth under paragraphs (b)(1), (4), and (5) of this section may be conditionally accepted by the Secretary if the state provides assurances deemed adequate by the Secretary that the state is moving to meet all of the requirements for full acceptance. If the Secretary conditionally accepts a state's installation program, the Secretary will provide to the state an explanation of what is necessary to obtain full acceptance.</P>
              <P>(2) A conditionally accepted state will be permitted to implement its own installation program in lieu of the HUD-administered program for a period of not more than 3 years. The Secretary may for good cause grant an extension of conditional approval upon petition by the state.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limited exemptions from requirements.</E> A state installation program may be accepted by the Secretary as a qualifying installation program if the state can demonstrate that it lacks legal authority, as a matter of federal law, to impose the minimum requirements set forth under paragraph (b) of this section in certain geographic areas of the state, but that the minimum requirements do apply in all other geographic areas of the state.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission of certification.</E> (1) A state seeking identification as having a qualified installation program must submit a completed State Installation Program Certification form to the Secretary for review and acceptance and indicate if the installation program will be part of its approved state plan in accordance with part 3282 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) A state must include a qualified installation program as part of any state plan application submitted for approval under § 3282.302 of this chapter, if the state does not have a fully or conditionally approved state plan in effect at the time of submission of the state plan application. In all other cases, a qualified installation program is permitted, but is not required, to be <PRTPAGE P="275"/>submitted as a part of a state plan approved in accordance with § 3282.305 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD review and action.</E> (1) The Secretary will review the State Installation Program Certification form submitted by a state and may request that the state submit additional information as necessary. Unless the Secretary has contacted the state for additional information or has conditionally accepted or rejected the state installation program, the state installation program will be considered to have been accepted by the Secretary as a fully qualifying installation program as of the earlier of:</P>
              <P>(i) Ninety days after the Secretary receives the state's completed State Installation Program Certification form; or</P>

The state will be given 90 days from the date the Secretary provides such explanation to submit a revised State Installation Program Certification form.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Secretary decides that any revised State Installation Program Certification form is inadequate, or if the state fails to submit a revised form within the 90-day period or otherwise indicates that it does not intend to change its form, the Secretary will notify the state that its installation program is not accepted.</P>
              <P>(3) A state whose State Installation Program Certification form is rejected has a right to a presentation of views on the rejection using the procedures set forth under subpart D of part 3282 of this chapter. The state's request for a presentation of views must be submitted to the Secretary within 60 days after the Secretary has provided notification that the state's installation program has been rejected.</P>

              <P>(1) Every 5 years after the state's most recent certification as a qualified installation program; and</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever there is a change to the state's installation program or a change in the HUD requirements applicable to qualifying installation programs such that the state's installation program no longer complies with the minimum requirements set forth in § 3286.803(b), regardless of when the state's next regular recertification of its installation program would be due.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Due date of recertification.</E> (1) A state's recertification required in paragraph (a) of this section must be filed within 90 days of, as applicable:</P>

              <P>(ii) The effective date of the state or HUD action that makes a significant change to the state's installation program.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon petition by the state, the Secretary may for good cause grant an extension of the deadline for recertification.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to Recertify.</E> (1) A state whose certification of its installation program, when the installation program is not part of the approved state plan in accordance with part 3282 of this chapter, has been accepted by the Secretary is permitted to administer its installation program in lieu of the HUD-administered installation program until the effective date of a notification by the Secretary that the state's certification of its installation program is no longer approved.</P>

              <P>(2) A state whose recertification of its installation program is rejected by the Secretary has a right to a presentation of views on the rejection using the procedures set forth under subpart D of part 3282 of this chapter.

              <SECTNO>§ 3288.1</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Act is intended, in part, to protect the quality, safety, durability, and affordability of manufactured homes. Section 623(c)(12) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5422 (c)(12)) requires the implementation of “a dispute resolution program for the timely resolution of disputes between manufacturers, retailers, and installers of manufactured homes regarding responsibility, and for the issuance of appropriate orders, for the correction or repair of defects in manufactured homes that are reported during the 1-year period beginning on the date of installation.” The purpose of this part is to provide a dispute resolution program for the timely resolution of disputes among manufacturers, retailers, and installers regarding the responsibility for correction or repair of defects reported by the homeowner or others and reported in the 1-year period after the first installation of the manufactured home.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> In carrying out this purpose, it is presumed that if a manufactured home contains an alleged defect that is reported in the first year after installation and was not caused by the homeowner, then the manufacturer, retailer, or installer is responsible for the alleged defect and the dispute resolution process recognized in this part is an appropriate means for resolving disputes about responsibility for correction and repair of the alleged defect. For purposes of the dispute resolution process recognized in this part, only alleged defects reported in the first year after the first installation are covered by the process. The state where the home is sited determines whether the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program or a state program applies. Subpart A of this part establishes general provisions applicable to HUD's implementation of a dispute resolution program as required by the Act. Subpart B of this part establishes the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program that HUD will administer in any state that does not establish a program that complies with the Act and been accepted by HUD as provided in subpart D of this part. Subpart C of this part provides an Alternative Process for manufacturers, retailers, and installers who agree that a homeowner is not responsible for the alleged defect to resolve their disputes about responsibility for correction or repair outside of the HUD Mediation and Arbitration Process under subpart B. Subpart D of this part establishes the minimum requirements that must be met by a state applying to implement its own dispute resolution program that complies with the Act, and the procedure for determining whether the requirements for complying have been met. Subpart E of this part establishes special rulemaking procedures that apply to the issuance of new regulations that implement the dispute resolution requirements set forth in section 623 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5422).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Warranties not affected.</E> This part is not a warranty program and the requirements established in this part do not replace the manufacturer's or any other warranty program. Such warranty program may have its own requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reporting a defect.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Making a report.</E> To preserve the right to request dispute resolution through HUD, alleged defects must be reported to the manufacturer, retailer, installer, HUD, or a State Administrative Agency. An alleged defect may be reported by a homeowner, manufacturer, retailer, or installer.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of report.</E> It is recommended that alleged defects be reported in writing, including, but not limited to, e-mail, written letter, certified mail, or fax. The existence of an alleged defect may also be reported by telephone.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Content of report.</E> No particular form or format is required to report an alleged defect, but any such report must, at a minimum, include a description of the alleged defect, the name of homeowner, and the address of the home.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Record of report</E>—(1) <E T="03">To evidence timeliness.</E> To establish timely reporting, the report of an alleged defect that is made to the manufacturer, retailer, installer, or a State Administrative Agency of the manufactured home should be done in a manner that will create a dated record of the report that demonstrates that the report was made within 1 year after the date of installation; for example, by certified mail, fax, or email. Persons who report an alleged defect by telephone should make a contemporaneous note of the telephone call, including date, time, the name of the person who received the report, the name of the business contacted, and the telephone number called. If the matter goes to arbitration, the arbitrator and HUD will review whether there is sufficient evidence to believe the report was made on a timely basis.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Obligation to retain.</E> Each report of a defect, including logs of telephonic complaints, received by a manufacturer, retailer, a State Administrative Agency or installer, must be maintained for 3 years from the date of receipt.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reports made to a State Administrative Agency.</E> Reports of defects in the manufactured home that are made in the first year after its installation can be sent to the appropriate State Administrative Agency. Contact information about a State Administrative Agency is available at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov.</E> Contact the appropriate State Administrative Agency to determine the method for making the report.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reports made to HUD.</E> Reports of alleged defects in the manufactured home that are made in the first year after its installation can be sent to HUD. The report to HUD may be made using any of the following methods:</P>
              <P>(1) In writing at: HUD, Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing, Attn: Dispute Resolution, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-8000;</P>
              <P>(2) By telephone at: (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891;</P>

              </P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Effect of report.</E> The reporting of an alleged defect does not initiate the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program, but only establishes whether the requirement of timely reporting in accordance with § 3288.15(b) has been met. The HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Process is initiated when a request for dispute resolution is submitted to HUD in accordance with § 3288.25.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Initiation of dispute resolution.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preliminary effort.</E> HUD strongly encourages the homeowner or party reporting an alleged defect to seek to resolve the dispute directly with any manufacturer, retailer, or installer <PRTPAGE P="280"/>that the person reporting the defect believes to be responsible before initiating the HUD dispute resolution process.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for dispute resolution.</E> Any of the parties or the homeowner may initiate the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program at any time after an alleged defect has been reported, by requesting dispute resolution, as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) By mailing, e-mailing, or otherwise delivering a written request for dispute resolution to the dispute resolution provider at the address or e-mail address provided either at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov,</E> or by contacting HUD's Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891;</P>

              <P>(2) By faxing a request for dispute resolution to the fax number provided either at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov,</E> or by contacting HUD's Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891; or</P>

              <P>(3) By telephoning a request for dispute resolution to the number provided either at <E T="03">http://www.hud.gov,</E> or by contacting HUD's Office of Regulatory Affairs and Manufactured Housing at (202) 708-6423 or (800) 927-2891.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requested information.</E> The dispute resolution provider will request at least the following information when a person seeks to initiate dispute resolution under the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program:</P>
              <P>(1) The name, address, and contact information of the homeowner;</P>
              <P>(2) The name and contact information of the manufacturer, retailer, and installer of the manufactured home, to the extent available;</P>
              <P>(3) The date the report of the alleged defect was made;</P>
              <P>(4) The name and contact information of the recipient or recipients of the report of the alleged defect;</P>
              <P>(5) The date of installation of the manufactured home affected by the alleged defect; and</P>
              <P>(6) A description of the alleged defect.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Screening of dispute resolution request.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review for sufficiency.</E> When the request for dispute resolution has been received by the dispute resolution provider, a screening neutral will review the sufficiency of the information provided in the request for dispute resolution and determine if the dispute resolution process should proceed. If the screening neutral determines that a defect is properly alleged and timely reported, notice of the request will be forwarded, as provided in § 3288.33, to the manufacturer, retailer, and installer, as appropriate and to the extent the appropriate parties can be identified based on the information in the request.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Insufficient information.</E> If a request for dispute resolution is lacking any information necessary to determine if the dispute resolution process should proceed, the screening neutral will contact the requester or the parties about supplementing the initial request. If information necessary to qualify the matter for the HUD Manufactured Home Dispute Resolution Program is not received within a reasonable time established by the screening neutral, the request for dispute resolution will be considered withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of a dispute.</E> Denial by all of the parties that there is a dispute does not preclude the dispute resolution process from going forward to mediation. A screening neutral's determination that a defect is properly alleged is prima facie evidence of a dispute. If the defect has not been corrected or repaired, the matter will be referred to mediation.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determination of unreasonable risk.</E> If the screening neutral determines there is sufficient documentation of an alleged defect presenting an unreasonable risk of injury or death, he or she will send a copy of the request to HUD.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice of dispute resolution.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Once the screening neutral determines that a defect is properly alleged and timely reported, notice about the request will be forwarded to the parties by overnight delivery, commercial carrier, or fax.</P>
              <P>(b) If the parties have not initiated the Alternative Process in accordance with § 3288.105 of this part within 7 days of the screening neutral's notification, the screening neutral will refer the matter to mediation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mediation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Mediator.</E> The dispute resolution provider will provide for the selection of a mediator. The selected mediator will not be the person who screened the dispute resolution request. The selected mediator will mediate the dispute and attempt to facilitate a settlement. If a party identifies any other party that should be included in the mediation, the mediator will contact the other party and provide information about the scheduled mediation meetings.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Time</E>—(1) <E T="03">For reaching settlement.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the parties are allowed 30 days from the commencement of the mediation to reach a mediated settlement. In every case, the dispute resolution provider will notify the parties and the homeowner, in writing, of the date of the commencement of the mediation.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Alleged defects presenting an unreasonable risk of injury, death, or significant loss or damage to valuable personal property.</E> For mediations involving alleged defects that appear to present an unreasonable risk of injury, death, or significant loss or damage to valuable personal property as determined by the screening neutral, the parties have a maximum 10 days from the commencement of the mediation to reach a settlement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">For corrective repairs.</E> Unless a longer period is agreed to in writing by the parties to the mediated settlement and the homeowner, corrective repairs must be completed no later than 30 days after the date the settlement agreement is signed by the applicable parties.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Denial of dispute.</E> During mediation, denial of a dispute by all parties without acceptance of responsibility will result in the mediator referring the matter to arbitration for determination of the defect and responsibility for the defect.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Written settlement agreement.</E> (1) Upon reaching an agreement, the parties will sign a written settlement agreement. The dispute resolution provider will forward copies of the agreements with the original signatures of the parties to the parties, the homeowner, and to HUD.</P>

              <P>(1) The timely resolution of disputes among manufacturers, retailers, or installers regarding responsibility for correction and repair of defects in manufactured homes;<PRTPAGE P="284"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The issuance of appropriate orders for correction and repair of defects in such homes;</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability to programs in state plans.</E> (1) In order to include a dispute resolution program in a state plan that on February 8, 2008 is fully or conditionally approved under § 3282.302 of this chapter, a state must amend its state plan to provide for the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) After February 8, 2008, a state that submits a state plan for approval in accordance with § 3282.302 of this chapter must provide for the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section in its state plan.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 3288.210</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Acceptance and recertification process.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission of certification.</E> A state seeking HUD acceptance of its state dispute resolution program under this subpart must submit to HUD a completed Dispute Resolution Certification Form, which is available by contacting HUD by telephone at (202) 708-6423 or by e-mail at <E T="03">mhs@hud.gov.</E> The certification may be submitted as a part of, or independent of, a state plan under § 3282.302 of this chapter. If included as part of a state plan, the state does not have to separately certify that it meets the requirements of § 3288.205(a)(4).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD review and action.</E> (1) HUD will review the Dispute Resolution Certification Form submitted by a state and may contact the state to request additional clarification or information as necessary. Upon completing its review, HUD will provide the state with notice of acceptance, conditional acceptance, or rejection of its dispute resolution program.</P>
              <P>(2) A notice of acceptance will include the date of acceptance.</P>
              <P>(3) If HUD rejects a state's dispute resolution program, HUD will provide an explanation of what is necessary to obtain full acceptance. A revised Dispute Resolution Certification Form may be submitted within 30 days of receipt of such notification. If the revised Dispute Resolution Certification Form is inadequate or if the state fails to resubmit within the 30-day period or otherwise indicates that it does not intend to change its Dispute Resolution Certification Form, HUD will notify the state that its dispute resolution program is not accepted and that it has a right to a hearing on the rejection using the procedures set forth under subpart D of part 3282 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditional acceptance.</E> A state meeting three of the four minimum requirements set forth under § 3288.205(a)(1) through (4) will be conditionally accepted by HUD. If HUD conditionally accepts a state's dispute resolution program, HUD will provide an explanation of what is necessary to obtain full acceptance. A revised Dispute Resolution Certification Form may be submitted within 30 days of receipt of such notification. Any state conditionally accepted will be permitted to implement its own dispute resolution program for a period of not more than 3 years, absent extension of this period by HUD.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Revocation.</E> If HUD becomes aware at any time that a state no longer meets the minimum requirements set forth under § 3288.205, HUD may revoke acceptance of the state's certification after an opportunity for a hearing, using the procedures set forth under subpart D of part 3282.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recertification of a program not included in state plan.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (f), to maintain its accepted status, a state whose program is not included in an approved or conditionally approved state plan must submit a current Dispute Resolution Certification Form to HUD for review and acceptance as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Every 3 years within 90 days of the day and month of the most recent date of HUD's acceptance of the state's program or</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever there is a significant change to the program.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Inclusion in state plan.</E> If a state dispute resolution program is part of a state plan, it will be reviewed annually as part of the state plan and separate recertification of the state's dispute resolution program is not required.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Functions and activities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General statement.</E> The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (referred to in this part as <E T="03">the Corporation</E>) was established by Congress in the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act (title VI of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, Pub. L. 95-557, October 31, 1978). The Corporation is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(b) The Corporation is authorized to receive and expend Federal appropriations and other public and private revenues to conduct a variety of programs designed primarily to revitalize older urban neighborhoods by mobilizing public, private, and community resources at the neighborhood level. These programs include:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Neighborhood Housing Services.</E> The major effort of the Corporation is to assist local communities in the development, expansion and provision of technical services to local Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) programs. NHS programs are based upon partnerships of community residents, and representatives of local governments and financial institutions. Each local program is administered by an autonomous, private, non-profit corporation, and conducts a comprehensive revitalization effort in locally selected neighborhoods. Services to neighborhood residents include rehabilitation counseling, construction assistance, financial counseling, loan referrals and loans at flexible rates and terms to homeowners who do not meet private lending criteria. Programs and strategies to remove blighting influences, obtain improved public services and amenities, and improve the neighborhood's image and the functioning of its real estate market are also undertaken. To insure the continuing effectiveness of NHS programs, the Corporation provides grants, training, information and technical services to NHS programs.'</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Mutual Housing Associations.</E> The Corporation also supports the organizational development of, and provides technical assistance to, Mutual Housing Associations. Mutual Housing Associations are private, nonprofit organizations which own, manage and continually develop affordable housing. Mutual Housing residents are members of the Association which owns and manages their buildings; thus they enjoy the security of long-term housing tenure. Mutual Housing developments are capitalized through up-front grants and mortgages in a combination that ensures permanent affordability to low- and moderate-income families. Monthly housing charges to residents are kept at affordable levels on a continuing basis. A key element of Mutual Housing is the Association's commitment to use all resources in excess of operating and maintenance costs for the production of additional units. A Mutual Housing Association's board of directors includes current member-residents, potential residents, and representatives from the community, local government and business. Residents and community members make up the majority on the board. A highly qualified professional staff, employed by the Mutual Housing Association, carries out the day-to-day activities of the organization. In addition to creating new affordable housing opportunities, Mutual Housing Associations offer a creative alternative for subsidized rental housing developments whose subsidies are scheduled to expire.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Neighborhood preservation projects.</E> The Corporation identifies, monitors, evaluates and supports through demonstration grants and technical assistance other promising neighborhood preservation strategies based on local, public-private partnerships.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
            </P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Programmatic supplements.</E> Proven, replicable programmatic tools are offered as broadly as resources permit. Often, these selected strategies are supported by Neighborhood Reinvestment grants. The Corporation's major programmatic supplements include the following:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization strategies.</E> The Corporation's neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization strategies offer NHSs a variety of tools designed to stabilize and enhance the economic base of NHS neighborhoods. They complement NHSs' revitalization mission by focusing the energies and resources of the partnership on the economic issues underlying neighborhood decline. Neighborhood economic development and commercial revitalization assures a viable neighborhood economy by strengthening small businesses and improving the physical environment of the area, thus providing additional goods, services, and employment opportunities for the community.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Housing Development Strategies.</E> The Corporation's Housing Development Strategies program addresses the shortage of affordable, quality housing available to low to moderate income families in NHS neighborhoods, as well as the blighting effect of vacant lots and substandard properties. Home ownership opportunities are created through the planning and implementation of a variety of housing mechanisms by the NHS, which are intended to reverse negative real estate market trends, enhance new residential growth, and create renewed neighborhood pride. The mechanisms being used to achieve these goals include the following.</P>
            <P>(A) The Owner Built Housing program is a supervised housing construction process that helps moderate-income homeowners to collectively build their own homes. The NHS provides technical assistance while private lenders and public bodies providing financing.</P>
            <P>(B) The Owner Rehab Housing program assists low to moderate income families in collectively rehabilitating existing blighted and vacant structures.</P>
            <P>(C) The Infill Housing program provides a mechanism for assisting NHSs in building new units on vacant land to meet the needs of prospective lower income homeowners.</P>
            <P>(D) The Urban Subdivisions program focuses on providing low cost, new housing for low-to-moderate income families on tracts of land suitable for the construction of 20 or more units.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Problem properties strategies.</E> This program assists NHSs in addressing specific problem areas beyond the scope of basic NHS services and typical financial resources. Through the implementation of various problem properties strategies, NHS programs are able to assist tenants to purchase, improve the physical condition of target blocks, eliminate vacant neighborhood eyesores, develop housing and service facilities for special populations, and stimulate private reinvestment and new conventional mortgages in the NHS community.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Apartment Improvement Program.</E> The goal of the Apartment Improvement Program is to provide an effective, economical means of revitalizing and preserving neighborhoods with multi-family housing for the benefit of the current residents. The program is based upon a partnership of tenants and community representatives, property owners and managers, financial institutions and local government. The program assists in the development of an individually tailored improvement plan of activities from which each building may benefit, including tenant participation, tax assessment reviews, and increased investment or restructured mortgages to improve the economic viability of the buildings and to finance improvements.</P>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Neighborhood Housing Services of America.</E> The Corporation also supports Neighborhood Housing Services of America (NHSA), an independent, private, non-profit corporation which provides a variety of services to local NHS programs, including a secondary market for NHS revolving loan fund loans, and the strengthening of private sector resources available to the network of local NHSs.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General organization.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">The Board of Directors.</E> (1) The Corporation is under the direction of a Board of Directors composed of six members: the Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board or a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board designated by the Chairman; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated by the Chairman; the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the appointive member of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if so designated by the Chairman; the Comptroller of the Currency; and the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, or a member of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration designated by the Chairman. Members of the Board serve without additional compensation. The Board elects from among its members a Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The Bylaws of the Corporation provide for the creation of an Audit Committee, and such other committees as the Board may from time to time establish.</P>
            <P>(2) The Board holds an Annual Meeting each year during the month of May (or as the Bylaws or the Board may specify). The Board also holds regular meetings at least quarterly and special meetings as required. The meetings of the Board are conducted in accordance with provisions of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b), the Corporation's Bylaws, and when not inconsistent with the foregoing, with Robert's Rules of Order. Every portion of every meeting of the Board is open to public observation except as provided by the Government in the Sunshine Act. Interested members of the public may attend such meetings, but may not participate therein unless invited or permitted to do so by the Board.</P>
            <P>(3) The Secretary of the Corporation, in consultation with the Corporation's General Counsel, is responsible for taking such steps as are required to ensure the Corporation's compliance with the Government in the Sunshine Act, as that Act may be amended from time to time. Consistent with this responsibility, the Secretary of the Corporation provides to the Communications Department at the principal office of the Corporation such records as the Act requires to be made available to the public for access during regular office hours on regular business days.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">The Officers.</E> (1) The officers of the Corporation are the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive Director, the Secretary, the Treasurer, and such other officer positions as the Board may, in consultation with the Executive Director, create. The Board elects the officers of the Corporation annually.</P>
            <P>(2) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act provides that the Executive Director shall serve as the chief executive officer of the Corporation. Consistent with that authority, the Corporation's Bylaws provide that the Executive Director shall have the responsibility and authority for the day-to-day administration of the affairs of the Corporation under the general supervision of the Board. The Board periodically reviews the activities of the Executive Director and, from time to time, provides guidance and policy direction to the Executive Director in the exercise of his or her authority.</P>
            <P>(3) The responsibilities and authorities of the other officers of the Corporation are set forth in the Corporation's Bylaws, resolutions and policies adopted by the Board, duties and authorities delegated to each officer, other statutes and this statement. (See, for example, the Government in the Sunshine Act and paragraph (a)(3) of this section for specific duties of the Secretary and General Counsel.)</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Principal office.</E> The Corporation maintains its principal office in the District of Columbia. Currently, the principal office is maintained at 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005.</P>

            <P>The Corporation conducts its field activities from district and field offices around the country. District offices <PRTPAGE P="294"/>provide coordination of field activities in support of local programs within the geographic limits of each district. Field offices within each district provide assistance in the development and support of local programs. A current directory of all district and field offices can be obtained upon request from the Communications Department, Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Inquiries.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> All requests for information, forms, and records should be addressed to: Communications Department, Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, 1325 G Street NW., Suite 800, Washington, DC 20005.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Applications.</E> Applications for the Corporation's assistance in the development of NHS programs and complementary programs and strategies, or the support of other promising neighborhood strategies are accepted on an ongoing basis. Local governmental or nonprofit entities should submit completed applications (forms are available upon request), including supportive materials, to the Corporation at the address stated in paragraph (a) of this section. The Corporation reviews applications to determine their readiness for development or support. Promising applications are selected for field reviews. Subject to the availability of the Corporation's resources, the Corporation may enter into agreements with top ranking applicants to provide financial and technical assistance in the development or support of selected programs. The application form contains a list of the criteria used for determining the readiness and promise of applications.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Records.</E> (1) The Corporation maintains such records and information for public inspection and copying as are required by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), as that Act may be amended from time to time. Records are available for public inspection and copying during regular business hours on regular business days at the address stated in paragraph (a) of this section. Requests for records should be submitted in writing and state the full name and address of the person requesting the records and a description of the records or other information sought that is reasonably sufficient to permit their identification without undue difficulty. A request should be submitted sufficiently in advance of the date inspection or copying is desired, preferably by mail.</P>
            <P>(2) Although the Corporation finds that the publication of indexes of statements of policy and interpretations or administrative staff manuals and instructions would be unnecessary and impracticable, such information will be made available upon request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees for providing copies for records.</E> Fees shall be assessed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) in order to recover the full allowable direct costs of providing copies of records. For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">direct costs</E> means those expenditures which the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) request. Direct costs include, for example, the salaries of the employees performing the work (the basic rate of pay plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. The term <E T="03">search</E> includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. The term <E T="03">duplication</E> refers to the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The term <E T="03">review</E> refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of any document is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to exise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general <PRTPAGE P="295"/>legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. A schedule based on these principles is set forth in paragraph (d)(9) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Categories of requesters.</E> Fees will be assessed according to the category of the requester. There are four categories:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">commercial use request</E> refers to a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will look to the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. If the use is not clear from the request itself, or if there is reasonable cause to doubt the requester's stated use, the Corporation shall seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters.</E> For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">educational institution</E> refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. The term <E T="03">noncommercial scientific institution</E> refers to an institution that is not operated on a <E T="03">commercial</E> basis, as that term is used in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution, and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a noncommercial scientific institution) research.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">representative of the news media</E> refers to any person actively gathering information for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of <E T="03">news</E>) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. In the case of <E T="03">freelance</E> journalists, they may be regarded as working for a news organization if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look at the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria above, and his or her request must not be made for a commerical use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.</P>
            <P>(iv) All other requesters.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations on fees to be charged</E>—(i) <E T="03">Commercial use requesters.</E> Commercial use requesters shall be assessed the full direct costs for searching for, reviewing, and duplicating records, in accordance with the fee schedule at paragraph (d)(9) of this section. Commercial use requesters are not entitled to the free search time or free pages of duplication provided to other categories of requesters.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters.</E> Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for duplication of records in excess of the first 100 pages. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for search or review.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requesters who are representatives of the news media.</E> Requesters in this category may be assessed fees only for duplication of records in excess of the <PRTPAGE P="296"/>first 100 pages. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for research or review.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">All other requesters.</E> Requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above shall be assessed fees only for searching and duplicating records, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requesters in this category may not be assessed fees for review.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Review of records.</E> Charges will be assessed only for the initial review of the located documents and not for time spent at the administrative appeal level on an exemption applied at the initial determination level. However, where records or portions of records are withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply, and these records are reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, charges for review are properly assessable.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">Additional copies.</E> The Corporation will normally furnish only one copy of any record. The allowance of 100 free pages of duplication under paragraphs (d)(2) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not apply to additional copies furnished at the request of the record requester. Full duplication fees shall be assessed for each page of each such additional copy.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Charges for unsuccessful search.</E> Where applicable under paragraph (d)(2) of this section search fees may be assessed for time spent searching, even if the Corporation fails to locate the records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> Unless the person making the request states in his or her initial request that he or she will pay all costs regardless of amount, the Corporation will notify him or her as soon as possible if there is reason to believe that the cost for obtaining access to and/or copies of such records will exceed $25. If such notice is given, the time limitations contained in the Freedom of Information Act shall not commence until the person making the intitial request agrees in writing to pay such cost.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> The Communications Director is authorized to require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges whenever he or she determines that:</P>
            <P>(i) The allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250 and the requester has no history of payment and cannot provide satisfactory assurance that payment will be made; or</P>
            <P>(ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely manner.</P>
            <FP>If such a payment is required, the time limitations contained in the Freedom of Information Act shall not commence until payment is made.</FP>
            <P>(6) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> The Corporation will assess interest charges on any unpaid fees starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing for fees was sent to the requester. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing. Receipt of the fee by the Corporation, even if not processed, will stay the accrual of interest. Interest is not chargeable for unpaid advance payments under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>
            <P>(7) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of the document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.</P>
            <P>(8) <E T="03">Waiver or reduction of fee.</E> The Corporation will furnish documents without charge or at a reduced charge when it is determined that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Corporation and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making a request for a waiver or reduction of fees, a requester should include a clear statement of his or her interest in the requested documents: The <PRTPAGE P="297"/>proposed use for the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use; and a statement of how the public will benefit from such use. Determinations concerning waiver or reduction of fees shall be made by the Executive Director, or his or her designee.</P>
            <P>(9) <E T="03">Schedule of fees.</E> Fees for searching for, reviewing, duplicating, and providing records and information of the Corporation under this section will be assessed in accordance with the following schedule:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Manual search.</E> For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $3.37.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Computer search.</E> For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $3.37.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Review.</E> For each quarter hour or fraction thereof: $4.87.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Duplication.</E>
            </P>
            <P>(A) For a paper photocopy of an existing paper record, $.10 per page.</P>
            <P>(B) For duplication of records other than existing paper records (such as computer-stored information, audio or video tapes, microfiche or microfilm), the fee shall equal the actual direct cost of production and duplication of the records or information in a form that is reasonably usable by the requester.</P>
            <P>(10) <E T="03">Processing costs.</E> The Communications Director will waive payment in instances in which the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee.</P>
