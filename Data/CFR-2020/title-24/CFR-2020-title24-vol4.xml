      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2018), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The requirements of this part augment the requirements of section 802 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (approved November 28, 1990, Public Law 101-625) (42 U.S.C. 8011), (hereinafter, section 802), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), which authorizes the Congregate Housing Services Program (hereinafter, CHSP or Program).</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 700.105</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In addition to the definitions in section 802(k), the following definitions apply to CHSP:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Activity of Daily Living (ADL)</E> means an activity regularly necessary for personal care.</P>
            <P>(1) The minimum requirements of ADLs include:</P>
            <P>(i) Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self);</P>
            <P>(ii) Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);</P>
            <P>(iii) Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self);</P>
            <P>(iv) Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance);</P>
            <P>(v) Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and</P>
            <P>(vi) Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)</P>

            <P>(2) Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted in paragraph (1) of this definition includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified minimal level (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed himself or herself). The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive <E T="03">supportive services</E> paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy;</P>

            <SUBJECT>Professional assessment committee.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A professional assessment committee (PAC), as described in this section, shall recommend services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident. The PAC shall be either a voluntary committee appointed by the project management or an agency in the community which provides assessment services and conforms to section 802(e)(3)(A) and (B). PAC members are subject to the conflict of interest provisions in section 700.175(b).</P>

            <P>(2) The PAC shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process, and a right <PRTPAGE P="12"/>of appeal of the determination of eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records.</P>
            <P>(3) The dollar value of PAC members' time spent on regular assessments after initial approval of program participants may be counted as match. If a community agency discharges the duties of the PAC, staff time is counted as its imputed value, and if the members are volunteers, their time is counted as volunteer time, according to sections 700.145(c)(2) (ii) and (iv).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Duties of the PAC.</E> The PAC is required to:</P>

            <P>(1) Perform a formal assessment of each potential elderly program participant to determine if the individual is frail. To qualify as frail, the PAC must determine if the elderly person is deficient in at least three ADLs, as defined in section 700.105. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy of the informal support network (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual), and may include a more in-depth medical evaluation, if necessary;</P>
            <P>(2) Determine if non-elderly disabled individuals qualify under the definition of person with disabilities under section 700.105. If they do qualify, this is the acceptance criterion for them for CHSP. Persons with disabilities do not require an assessment by the PAC;</P>
            <P>(3) Perform a regular assessment and updating of the case plan of all participants;</P>
            <P>(4) Obtain and retain information in participant files, containing such information and maintained in such form, as HUD or RHS shall require;</P>
            <P>(5) Replace any members of the PAC within 30 days after a member resigns. A PAC shall not do formal assessments if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has not been replaced.</P>
            <P>(6) Notify the grantee or eligible owner and the program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures, and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period in which to review and comment, before adoption of a modification;</P>
            <P>(7) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in selection of CHSP participants, with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin, familial status or type of disability;</P>
            <P>(8) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974;</P>
            <P>(9) Provide all formal information and reports in writing.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibitions relating to the PAC.</E> (1) At least one PAC member shall not have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee.</P>
            <P>(2) No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing services under the grant.</P>
            <P>(3) Individuals or staff of third party organizations that act as PAC members may not be paid with CHSP grant funds.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligibility and admissions.</E> (1) Before selecting potential program participants, each grantee (with PAC assistance) shall develop a CHSP application form. The information in the individual's application is crucial to the PAC's ability to determine the need for further physical or psychological evaluation.</P>
            <P>(2) The PAC, upon completion of a potential program participant's initial assessment, must make a recommendation to the service coordinator for that individual's acceptance or denial into CHSP.</P>
            <P>(3) Once a program participant is accepted into CHSP, the PAC must provide a supportive services case plan for each participant. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into consideration the participant's needs and wants. The case plan must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain independence.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Transition-out procedures.</E> The grantee or PAC must develop procedures for providing for an individual's transition out of CHSP to another setting. Transition out is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by an individual to continue to live independently. If a program participant leaves the program, but wishes to retain supportive services, he or she may do so, as long as he or she continues to live in an eligible project, pays the full <PRTPAGE P="13"/>cost of services provided, and management agrees (section 802(e)(4) and (5)). A participant can be moved out of CHSP if he or she:</P>
            <P>(1) Gains physical and mental health and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time (in which case readmission, based upon reassessment to determine the degree of frailty or the disability, is acceptable);</P>
            <P>(2) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under CHSP; or</P>
            <P>(3) Fails to pay services fees.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Procedural rights of participants.</E> (1) The PAC must provide an informal process that recognizes the right to due process of individuals receiving assistance. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:</P>
            <P>(i) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;</P>
            <P>(ii) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.</P>
            <P>(2) Procedures must ensure that any potential or current program participant, at the time of initial or regular assessment, has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process.</P>
            <P>(3) In situations where an individual requests additional services, not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether the request is legitimately a needs-based service that can be covered under CHSP subsidy. Individuals can pay for services other than those recommended by the PAC as long as the additional services do not interfere with the efficient operation of the program.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Participatory agreement.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before actual acceptance into CHSP, potential participants must work with the PAC and the service coordinator in developing supportive services case plans. A participant has the option of accepting any of the services under the case plan.</P>
            <P>(b) Once the plan is approved by the PAC and the program participant, the participant must sign a participatory agreement governing the utilization of the plan's supportive services and the payment of supportive services fees. The grantee annually must renegotiate the agreement with the participant.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Grantees, the Secretary concerned, and participants shall all contribute to the cost of providing supportive services according to section 802(i)(A)(i). Grantees must contribute at least 50 percent of program cost, participants must contribute fees that in total are at least 10 percent of program cost, and the Secretary concerned will provide funds in an amount not to exceed 40 percent.</P>
            <P>(2) Section 802(i)(1)(B)(ii) creates a cost-sharing provision between grantee and the Secretary concerned if total participant fees collected over a year are less than 10 percent of total program cost. This provision is subject to availability of appropriated grant funds. If funds are not available, the grantee must assume the funding shortfall.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Prohibition on substitution of funds and maintenance of existing supportive services.</E> Grantees shall maintain existing funding for and provision of supportive services prior to the application date, as set forth in section 802(i)(1)(D). The grantee shall ensure that the activities provided to the project under a CHSP grant will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, these previously existing services. The value of these services do not qualify as matching funds. Such services must be maintained either for the time the participant remains in CHSP, or for the duration of CHSP grant. The grantee shall certify compliance with this paragraph to the Secretary concerned.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible matching funds.</E> (1) All sources of matching funds must be directly related to the types of supportive services prescribed by the PAC or used for administration of CHSP.</P>
            <P>(2) Matching funds may include:<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
            </P>
            <P>(i) Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available payments authorized under Medicaid for specific individuals in CHSP, Community Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants, Older American Act programs or excess residual funds with the approval of the Secretary concerned),</P>
            <P>(ii) The imputed dollar value of other agency or third party-provided direct services or staff who will work with or provide services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the new or expanded services of CHSP necessary to keep the program participants independent. If services are provided by the state, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, or local nonprofit housing sponsor, IHA, PHA, or for-profit or not-for-profit owner, any salary paid to staff from governmental sources to carry out the program of the grantee and any funds paid to residents employed by the Program (other than from amounts under a contract under section 700.155) is allowable match.</P>
            <P>(iii) In-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the current market value of donated common or office space, utility costs, furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in direct provision of services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed.</P>
            <P>(iv) The value of services performed by volunteers to CHSP, at the rate of $5.00 an hour.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> (1) The following are not eligible for use as matching funds:</P>

            <P>(iii) Section 8 funds other than excess residual receipts;</P>
            <P>(iv) Funds under section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, unless used for service coordination or case management; and</P>
            <P>(v) Comprehensive grant funds unless used for service coordination or case management;</P>
            <P>(2) Local government contributions are limited by section 802(i)(1)(E).</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Annual review of match.</E> The Secretary concerned will review the infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the program or budget review. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet program requirements at any point after grant start-up, or at any time during the term of the grant (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> if matching funds from sources other than program participant fees drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant share of supportive services funds accordingly.</P>

              <P>This part 761 contains the regulatory requirements for the Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Program (AHDEP) and the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP). The purposes of these programs are to:</P>
              <P>(a) Eliminate drug-related and violent crime and problems associated with it in and around the premises of Federally assisted low-income housing, and public and Indian housing developments;</P>
              <P>(b) Encourage owners of Federally assisted low-income housing, public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (collectively referred to as HAs), and resident management corporations to develop a plan that includes initiatives that can be sustained over a period of several years for addressing drug-related and violent crime and problems associated with it in and around the premises of housing proposed for funding under this part; and</P>
              <P>(c) Make available Federal grants to help owners of Federally assisted low-income housing, HAs, and RMCs carry out their plans.</P>

              <P>For the purposes of the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program, the elimination of drug-related and violent crime within public housing developments requires the active involvement and commitment of public housing residents and their organizations. To enhance the ability of PHAs to combat drug-related and violent crime within their developments, Resident Councils (RCs), Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), and Resident Organizations (ROs) will be permitted to undertake management functions specified in this part, notwithstanding the otherwise applicable requirements of part 964 of this title.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">PHDEP formula funding</E>—(1) <E T="03">Funding share formula</E>—(i) <E T="03">Per unit amount.</E> Subject to the availability of funding, the amount of funding made available each FFY to an applicant that qualifies for funding in accordance with § 761.15(a) is based upon the applicant's share of the total number of units of all applicants that qualify for funding, with a maximum award of $35 million and a minimum award of $25,000, except that qualified applicants with less than 50 units will not receive more than $500 per unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Calculation of number of units.</E> For purposes of determining the number of units counted for purposes of the PHDEP formula, HUD shall count as one unit each existing rental and Section 23 bond-financed unit under the ACC. Units that are added to a PHA's inventory will be added to the overall unit count so long as the units are under ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the date HUD establishes for the Federal Fiscal Year in which the PHDEP formula is being run (hereafter called the “reporting date”). Any such increase in units shall result in an adjustment upwards in the number of units under the PHDEP formula. New units reaching DOFA after this date will be counted for PHDEP formula purposes as of the following Federal Fiscal Year. Federalized units that are eligible for operating subsidy will be counted for PHDEP formula purposes based on the unit count reflected on the PHA's most recently approved Operating Budget (Form HUD-52564) and/or subsidy calculation (Form HUD-52723), or successor form submitted for that program. Units approved for demolition/disposition continue to be counted for PHDEP formula funding purposes until actual demolition/disposition of the unit.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Consortium funding.</E> The amount of funding made available to a consortium will be the total of the amounts that each individual member would otherwise qualify to receive under the PHDEP funding formula in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) An applicant must submit a PHDEP plan that meets the requirements of § 761.21, as required by § 761.15(a)(5), each FFY year to receive that FFY's funding. An applicant that does not submit a PHDEP plan for a FFY as required will not receive that FFY's funding.</P>
              <P>(ii) Ineligible activities, described at § 761.17(b), are not eligible for funding. Activities proposed for funding in an applicant's PHDEP plan that are determined to be ineligible will not be funded, and the applicant's funding for that FFY may be reduced accordingly.</P>
              <P>(iii) In accordance with § 761.15(a)(6), an applicant that does not meet the performance requirements of § 761.23 will be subject to the sanctions listed in § 761.30(f)(2).</P>
              <P>(iv) Both the amount of and continuing eligibility for funding is subject to the sanctions in § 761.30(f).</P>
              <P>(v) Any amounts that become available because of adjustments to an applicant's funding will be distributed to every other applicant that qualifies for funding in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">AHDEP funding.</E> Information concerning funding made available under AHDEP for a given FFY will be contained in Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs) published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <P>(i) A PHA;</P>
              <P>(ii) An RMC; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A consortium of PHAs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference PHAs.</E> A PHA that successfully competed for PHDEP funding under at least one of the PHDEP NOFAs for FFY 1996, FFY 1997 or FFY 1998 qualifies to receive PHDEP funding.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Needs qualification for funding.</E> An eligible applicant that does not qualify to receive PHDEP funding under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be in one of the following needs categories to qualify for funding:<PRTPAGE P="20"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The eligible applicant must be in the top 50% of the unit-weighted distribution of an index of a rolling average rate of violent crimes of the community, as computed for each Federal Fiscal Year (FFY). The crime rate used in this needs determination formula is the rate, from the most recent years feasible, of FBI violent crimes per 10,000 residents of the community (or communities). If this information is not available for a particular applicant's community, HUD will use the average of data from recipients of a comparable State and size category of PHA (less than 500 units, 500 to 1249 units, and more than 1250 units). If fewer than five PHAs have data for a given size category within a State, then the average of PHAs for a given size category within the census region will be used; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The eligible applicant must have qualified for PHDEP funding, by receiving an application score of 70 or more points under any one of the PHDEP NOFAs for FFY 1996, FFY 1997 or FFY 1998, but not have received an award because of the unavailability of funds.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Consortium of eligible applicants.</E> Eligible applicants may join together and form a consortium to apply for funding, whether or not each member would individually qualify for PHDEP funding under paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section. The act of two or more eligible applicants joining together to form a consortium, and identifying related crime problems and eligible activities to address those problems pursuant to a consortium PHDEP plan, qualifies the consortium for PHDEP funding of an amount as determined under § 761.13(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">PHDEP plan requirement.</E> (i) <E T="03">PHAs.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(ii), below, of this section, to receive PHDEP funding, a PHA that qualifies to receive PHDEP funding for Federal Fiscal Year 2000 and beyond must include a PHDEP plan that meets the requirements of § 761.21 with its PHA Plan submitted pursuant to part 903 of this title for each Federal Fiscal Year for which it qualifies for funding.</P>
              <P>(ii) To receive PHDEP funding, a PHA that qualifies to receive PHDEP funding and is operating under an executed Moving To Work (MTW) agreement with HUD must submit a PHDEP plan that meets the requirements of § 761.21 with its required MTW plan for each Federal Fiscal Year for which it qualifies for funding.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">RMCs.</E> To receive PHDEP funding, an RMC operating in an PHA that qualifies to receive PHDEP funding must submit a PHDEP plan for the units managed by the RMC that meets the requirements of § 761.21 to its PHA. Upon agreement between the RMC and PHA, the PHA must submit to HUD, with its PHA Plan submitted pursuant to part 903 of this title, the RMC's PHDEP plan. The RMC will implement its plan as a subrecipient of the PHA.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Consortia.</E> To receive PHDEP funding, the consortium members must prepare and submit a consortium PHDEP plan that meets the requirements of § 761.21, including the additional requirements that apply to consortia. Each member must submit the consortium plan with its PHA plan, submitted pursuant to part 903 of this title, or IHP, submitted pursuant to subpart C of part 1000 of this title, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(6) An otherwise qualified recipient PHA, RMC or consortium may not be funded if HUD determines, on a case-by-case basis, that it does not meet the performance requirements of § 761.23.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Qualifications for AHDEP funding.</E> Under AHDEP, eligible applicants are owners of federally assisted low-income housing, as the term <E T="03">Federally assisted low-income housing</E> is defined in § 761.10.

              <P>(i) If one or more investigators are to be employed for a service that is also provided by a local law enforcement agency, the applicant must undertake and retain a cost analysis that demonstrates the employment of investigators is more cost efficient than obtaining the service from the local law enforcement agency.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirement.</E> To receive funding under this part, each PHDEP qualified recipient or AHDEP applicant must submit to HUD, for Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2000 and each following FFY, a plan for addressing the problem of drug-related and violent crime in and around the housing covered by the plan. If the plan covers more than one development, it does not have to address each development separately if the same activities will apply to each development. The plan must address each development separately only where program activities will differ from one development to another. The plan must include a description of the planned activity or activities, a description of the role of plan partners and their contributions to carrying out the plan, a budget and timetable for implementation of the activities, and the funding source for each activity, identifying in particular all activities to be funded under this part. In addition, the plan must set measurable performance goals and interim milestones for the PHDEP-supported activities and describe the system for monitoring and evaluating these activities. Measurable goals must be established for each category of funded activities, including drug prevention, drug intervention, drug treatment, tenant patrols, and physical improvements. The plan under this section serves as the application for PHDEP funding, and an otherwise qualified recipient that does not <PRTPAGE P="24"/>submit a PHDEP plan as required will not be funded. For AHDEP funding, NOFAs published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> may provide additional information on plan requirements for purposes of this section. Plans must meet the requirements of this section before grant funds are distributed. HUD will review the submitted plans for a determination of whether they meet the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional requirements for consortia.</E> In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, to receive funding under this part, a consortium's plan must include a copy of the consortium agreement between the PHAs which are participating in the consortium, and a copy of the payment agreement between the consortium and HUD.</P>

              <P>In addition to the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart A, use of grant funds requires compliance with the following Federal requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Labor standards.</E> (1) When grant funds are used to undertake physical improvements to increase security under § 761.15(b)(3), the following labor standards apply:</P>
              <P>(i) The grantee and its contractors and subcontractors must pay the following prevailing wage rates, and must comply with all related rules, regulations and requirements:</P>

              <P>(A) For laborers and mechanics employed in the program, the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a <E T="03">et seq.</E>) to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trades;</P>

              <P>(B) For laborers and mechanics employed in carrying out nonroutine maintenance in the program, the HUD-determined prevailing wage rate. As used in paragraph (a) of this section, nonroutine maintenance means work items that ordinarily would be performed on a regular basis in the course of upkeep of a property, but have become substantial in scope because they have been put off, and that involve expenditures that would otherwise materially distort the level trend of maintenance expenses. Nonroutine maintenance may include replacement of equipment and materials rendered unsatisfactory because of normal wear <PRTPAGE P="29"/>and tear by items of substantially the same kind. Work that constitutes reconstruction, a substantial improvement in the quality or kind of original equipment and materials, or remodeling that alters the nature or type of housing units is not nonroutine maintenance.</P>
              <P>(ii) The employment of laborers and mechanics is subject to the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333).</P>
              <P>(2) The provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to labor contributed under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) Upon the request of any resident management corporation, HUD may, subject to applicable collective bargaining agreements, permit residents (for purposes of the Public Housing Program, residents of a program managed by the resident management corporation) to volunteer a portion of their labor.</P>
              <P>(ii) An individual may volunteer to perform services if:</P>
              <P>(A) The individual does not receive compensation for the voluntary services, or is paid expenses, reasonable benefits, or a nominal fee for voluntary services; and</P>
              <P>(B) Is not otherwise employed at any time in the work subject to paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) or (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Flood insurance.</E> Grants will not be awarded for proposed activities that involve acquisition, construction, reconstruction, repair or improvement of a building or mobile home located in an area that has been identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as having special flood hazards unless:</P>
              <P>(1) The community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program in accordance with 44 CFR parts 59 through 79; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of low-income housing needs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before budget authority is allocated, the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall determine the relative need for low-income housing assistance in each HUD field office jurisdiction. This determination shall be based upon data from the most recent, available decennial census and, where appropriate, upon more recent data from the Bureau of the Census or other Federal agencies, or from the American Housing Survey.</P>
              <P>(b) Except for paragraph (c) of this section, the factors used to determine the relative need for assistance shall be based upon the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Population.</E> The renter population;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Poverty.</E> The number of renter households with annual incomes at or below the poverty level, as defined by the Bureau of the Census;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Housing overcrowding.</E> The number of renter-occupied housing units with an occupancy ratio of 1.01 or more persons per room;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Housing vacancies.</E> The number of renter housing units that would be required to maintain vacancies at levels typical of balanced market conditions;</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Substandard housing.</E> The number of housing units built before 1940 and occupied by renter households with annual incomes at or below the poverty level, as defined by the Bureau of the Census; and</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Other objectively measurable conditions.</E> Data indicating potential need for rental housing assistance, such as the number of renter households with incomes below specified levels and paying a gross rent of more than 30 percent of household income.</P>
              <P>(c) For the section 202 elderly program, the data used shall reflect relevant characteristics of the elderly population. The data shall use the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) and (6) of this section, as modified to apply specifically to the needs of the elderly population.</P>
              <P>(d) Based on the criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall establish housing needs factors for each county and independent city in the field office jurisdiction, and shall aggregate the factors for such jurisdiction. The field office total for each factor is then divided by the respective national total for that factor. The resulting housing needs ratios under paragraph (b) of this section are then weighted to provide housing needs percentages for each field office, using the following weights: population—20 percent; poverty—20 percent; housing overcrowding—10 percent; housing vacancies—10 percent; substandard housing—20 percent; other objectively measurable conditions—20 percent. For the section 202 elderly program, the two criteria described in paragraph (c) of this section are weighted equally.</P>

              <P>(e) The Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall <PRTPAGE P="32"/>adjust the housing needs percentages derived in paragraph (d) of this section to reflect the relative cost of providing housing among the field office jurisdictions.</P>

              <P>(a) The total budget authority available for any fiscal year shall be determined by adding any available unreserved budget authority from prior fiscal years to any newly appropriated budget authority for each housing program.</P>
              <P>(b) Budget authority available for the fiscal year, except for that retained pursuant to § 791.407, shall be allocated to the field offices as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Budget authority shall be allocated as needed for uses that the Secretary determines are incapable of geographic allocation by formula, including—</P>
              <P>(i) Amendments of existing contracts, renewal of assistance contracts, assistance to families that would otherwise lose assistance due to the decision of the project owner to prepay the project mortgage or not to renew the assistance contract, assistance to prevent displacement or to provide replacement housing in connection with the demolition or disposition of public housing, assistance in support of the property disposition and loan management functions of the Secretary;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assistance which is—</P>
              <P>(A) The subject of a line item identification in the HUD appropriations law, or in the table customarily included in the Conference Report on the appropriation for the Fiscal Year in which the funds are to be allocated;</P>
              <P>(B) Reported in the Operating Plan submitted by HUD to the Committees on Appropriations; or</P>
              <P>(C) Included in an authorization statute where the nature of the assistance, such as a prescribed set-aside, is, in the determination of the Secretary, incapable of geographic allocation by formula,</P>
              <P>(iii) Assistance determined by the Secretary to be necessary in carrying out the following programs authorized by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act: the Homeownership and Opportunity Through HOPE Act under title IV and HOPE for Elderly Independence under section 803.</P>
              <P>(2) Budget authority remaining after carrying out allocation steps outlined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be allocated in accordance with the housing needs percentages calculated under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of § 791.402. HUD may allocate assistance under this paragraph in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in § 791.101(a) in each fiscal year. If the budget authority for a particular program is insufficient to fund feasible projects, or to promote meaningful competition, at the field office level, budget authority may be allocated among the ten geographic areas of the country. The funds so allocated will be assigned by Headquarters to the field office(s) with the highest ranked applications within the ten geographic areas.</P>

              <P>(c) At least annually HUD will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> informing the public of all allocations under § 791.403(b)(2).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General objective.</E> The allocation planning process should provide for the equitable distribution of available budget authority, consistent with the relative housing needs of each allocation area within the field office jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Establishing allocation areas.</E> Allocation areas, consisting of one or more counties or independent cities, shall be established by the field office in accordance with the following criteria:</P>

              <P>(1) Each allocation shall be to the smallest practicable area, but of sufficient size so that at least three eligible entities are viable competitors for funds in the allocation area, and so that all applicable statutory requirements can be met. (It is expected that in many instances individual MSAs will be established as metropolitan allocation areas.) For the section 202 program for the elderly, the allocation <PRTPAGE P="33"/>area must include sufficient units to promote a meaningful competition among disparate types of providers of such housing (e.g., local as well as national sponsors, minority as well as non-minority sponsors). The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.</P>
              <P>(2) Each allocation area shall also be of sufficient size, in terms of population and housing need, that the amount of budget authority being allocated to the area will support at least one feasible program or project.</P>
              <P>(3) In establishing allocation areas, counties and independent cities within MSAs should not be combined with counties that are not in MSAs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the amount of budget authority.</E> Where the field office establishes more than one allocation area, it shall determine the amount of budget authority to be allocated to each allocation area, based upon a housing needs percentage which represents the needs of that area relative to the field office jurisdiction. For each program, a composite housing needs percentage developed under § 791.402 for those counties and independent cities comprising the allocation area shall be aggregated into allocation area totals.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Planning for the allocation.</E> The field office should develop an allocation plan which reflects the amount of budget authority determined for each allocation area in paragraph (c). The plan should include a map or maps clearly showing the allocation areas within the field office jurisdiction. The relative share of budget authority by individual program type need not be the same for each allocation area, so long as the total amount of budget authority made available to the allocation area is not significantly reduced.</P>

              <P>(b) This part applies only to those instances when a tenant or owner committed fraud, and the fraud recoveries are obtained through litigation brought by the PHA (including settlement of the lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding, or an administrative repayment agreement with the family or owner as a result of a PHA administrative grievance procedure pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, § 982.555 of this title. This part does not apply to cases of owner fraud in PHA-<PRTPAGE P="35"/>owned or controlled units, or where incorrect payments were made or benefits received because of calculation errors instead of willful fraudulent activities.</P>
              <P>(c) This part applies to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries resulting from litigation brought by the PHA (including settlement of the lawsuit), or a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding obtained on or after October 8, 1986, and to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements signed on or after October 28, 1992.</P>

            <P>(a) In order for obligations to be tax-exempt under this subpart the obligations must be issued by a PHA in connection with a low-income housing project approved by HUD under the Act and the applicable Section 8 regulations.</P>
            <P>(1) Except as needed for a resident manager or similar requirement, all dwelling units in a low-income housing project that is to be financed with obligations issued pursuant to this subpart must be Section 8 contract units.</P>
            <P>(2) A low-income housing project that is to be financed with obligations issued pursuant to this subpart may include necessary appurtenances. Such appurtenances may include commerical space not to exceed 10% of the total net rentable area.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the parent entity PHA is not the owner of the project, the parent entity PHA or other PHA approvable under § 811.104 must agree to administer the contract pursuant to an ACC with HUD, and such a PHA must agree that in the event there is a default under the contract it will pursue all available remedies to achieve correction of the default, including operation and possession of the project, if called upon by HUD to do so. If the field office finds that the PHA does not have the capacity to perform these functions, the Assistant Secretary may approve alternative contractual arrangements for performing these functions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Refunding of obligations issued to finance Section 8 projects.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) This section states the terms and conditions under which HUD will approve refunding or defeasance of certain outstanding debt obligations which financed new construction or substantial rehabilitation of Section 8 projects, including fully and partially assisted projects.</P>
            <P>(b) In the case of bonds issued by State Agencies qualified under 24 CFR part 883 to refund bonds which financed projects assisted pursuant to 24 CFR part 883, HUD requires compliance with the prohibition on duplicative fees contained in 24 CFR part 883 and with paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section, as applicable to the projects to be refunded.</P>
            <P>(c) No agency shall issue obligations to refund outstanding 11(b) obligations until the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing sends the financing agency a Notification of Tax Exemption based on approval of the proposed refunding's terms and conditions as conforming to this part's requirements, including continued operation of the project as housing for low-income families, and where possible, reduction of Section 8 assistance payments through lower contract rents or an equivalent cash rebate to the U.S. Treasury (i.e. Trustee Sweep). The agency shall submit such documentation as HUD determines is necessary for review and approval of the refunding transaction. Upon conclusion of the closing of refunding bonds, written confirmation must be sent to the Office of Multifamily Housing by bond counsel, or other acceptable closing participant, including a schedule of the specific amount of savings in Section 8 assistance where applicable, CUSIP number information, and a final statement of Sources and Uses.</P>

            <P>(d)(1) HUD approval of the terms and conditions of a Section 8 refunding proposal requires evaluation by HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing of the reasonableness of the terms of the Agency's proposed financing plan, including projected reductions in project debt service where warranted by market conditions and bond yields. This evaluation shall determine that the proposed amount of refunding obligations is the amount needed to: pay off outstanding bonds; fund a debt service reserve to the extent required by credit enhancers or bond rating agencies, or bond underwriters in the case of unrated refunding bonds; pay credit enhancement fees acceptable to HUD; and <PRTPAGE P="44"/>pay transaction costs as approved by HUD according to a sliding scale ceiling based on par amount of refunding bond principal. Exceptions may be approved by HUD, if consistent with applicable statutes, in the event that an additional issue amount is required for project purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) The stated maturity of the refunding bonds may not exceed by more than one year the remaining term of the project mortgage, or in the case of an uninsured loan, the later of expiration date of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract (the “HAPC”) or final maturity of the refunded bonds.</P>
            <P>(3) The bond yield may not exceed by more than 75 basis points the 20 Bond General Obligation Index published by the Daily Bond Buyer for the week immediately preceding the sale of the bonds, except as otherwise approved by HUD. An amount not to exceed one-fourth of one percent annually of the bonds' outstanding principal balance may be allowed for servicing and trustee fees.</P>
            <P>(e) For projects for which the Agreement to enter into the HAPC was executed between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1984 (otherwise known as “McKinney Act Projects”), for which a State or local agency initiates a refunding, the Secretary shall make available to an eligible issuing agency 50 percent of the Section 8 savings of a refunding, as determined by HUD on a project-by-project basis, to be used by the agency in accordance with the terms of a Refunding Agreement executed by the Agency and HUD which incorporates the Agency's Housing Plan for use of savings to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for very low-income households. In determining the amount of savings recaptured on a project-by-project basis, as authorized by section 1012(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD will take into account the physical condition of the projects participating in the refunding which generate the McKinney Act savings and, if necessary, HUD will finance in refunding bond debt service correction of existing deficiencies which cannot be funded completely by existing project replacement reserves or by a portion of reserves released from the refunded bond's indenture. For McKinney Act refundings of projects which did not receive a Financing Adjustment Factor (“FAF”), HUD will allow up to 50 percent of debt service savings to be allocated to the project account; in which case, the remainder will be shared equally by the Agency and the U.S. Treasury.</P>

            <P>(f) For refundings of Section 8 projects other than McKinney Act Projects, and for all transactions which substitute collateral for, but do not redeem, outstanding obligations, and for which a HUD approval is needed (such as assignment of a HAPC or insured mortgage note), the Office of Multifamily Housing in consultation with HUD Field Office Counsel will review the HAPC, the Trust Indenture for the outstanding obligations, applicable HUD regulations, and reasonableness of proposed financing terms. In particular, HUD review should be obtained for the release of reserves from the trust indenture of the outstanding 11(b) bonds that are being refunded, defeased, or pre-paid. A proposal to distribute to a non-Federal entity the benefits of a refinancing, such as debt service savings and/or balances in reserves held under the original Trust Indenture, should be referred to the Office of Multifamily Housing for further review. In proposals submitted for HUD approval, HUD will consent to release reserves, as provided by the Trust Indenture, in an amount remaining after correction of project physical deficiencies and/or replenishment of replacement reserves, where needed. In the case of a refunding of 11(b) bonds by a public agency issuer which is the owner of the project and is entitled to reserves held under the Trust Indenture, HUD requires execution by the project owner of a use agreement, and amendment of a regulatory agreement, if applicable, to extend low-income tenant occupancy for ten years after expiration of the original HAPC term. In the case of HAP contracts with renewable 5-year terms, the Use Agreement shall extend for 10 years after the project owners first opt-out date. The Use Agreement may also be required of private entity owners, unless the refunding is incidental to a transfer of project ownership or a transaction which provides a substantial public <PRTPAGE P="45"/>benefit, as determined by the Office of Multifamily Housing. Proposed use of benefits shall be consistent with applicable appropriations law, the HAPC, and other requirements applicable to the original project financing, and the proposed financing terms must be reasonable in relation to bond market yields and transaction fees, as approved by the HUD Office of Multifamily Housing.</P>
            <P>(g) Agencies shall have wide latitude in the design of specific delivery vehicles for use of McKinney Act savings, subject to HUD audit of each Agency's performance in serving the targeted income eligible population. Savings may be used for shelter costs of providing housing, rental, or owner-occupied, to very low-income households through new construction, rehabilitation, repairs, and acquisition with or without rehab, including assistance to very low-income units in mixed-income developments. These include programs designed to assist in obtaining shelter, such as rent or homeownership subsidies. Self-sufficiency services in support of very low-income housing are also eligible, and may include, but are not limited to, homeownership counseling, additional security measures in high-crime areas, construction job training for residents' repair of housing units occupied by very low-income families, and empowerment activities designed to support formation and growth of resident entities. Except for the cost of providing third-party program audit reports to HUD, eligible costs exclude consultant fees or reimbursement of Agency staff expenses, but may include fees for professional services required in the Agency's McKinney Act programs of assistance to very low-income families. Unless otherwise specified by HUD in a McKinney Agreement, savings shall be subject to the above use requirements for 10 years from the date of receipt of the savings.</P>
            <P>(h) Refunding bonds, including interest thereon, approved under this Section shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, and the notification of approval of tax exemption shall not be subject to revocation by HUD. Whether refunding bonds approved under this section meet the requirements of Section 103 or any other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code is not within the responsibilities of HUD to determine. Such bonds shall be prepaid during the HAPC term only under such conditions as HUD shall require.</P>

The Program authorized the Secretary to make housing development grants to support the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of real property to be used primarily for residential rental purposes. Section 289(b)(1) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12839) repealed section 17 effective October 1, 1991.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Tenant selection.</E> The owner shall determine the eligibility of applicants for lower income units in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR parts 812 and 813, including the provisions of these parts concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status and income limits, and certain assistance to mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status.). The owner shall not, during the 20-year period from the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy, discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of their receipt of, or eligibility for, housing assistance under any Federal, State, or local housing assistance program or, except for an elderly housing project, on the basis that they have a minor child or children who will be living with them.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Restriction on leasing assisted units.</E> The owner shall assure that the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement is occupied, or is available for occupancy, by low-income households during the period beginning on the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy through 20 years from the date on which 50 percent of the units are occupied. The owner may lease a low-income unit only to a tenant that is a low-income household at the time of its initial occupancy. An owner may continue to lease a low-income unit to a tenant that ceases to qualify as a low-income household only as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Low-income unit rent.</E> (1) Section 17(d)(8)(A) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 prohibits the rents for low-income units from exceeding “30 per centum of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families.” This paragraph describes how these maximum rent determinations are made.</P>

              <P>(2) The maximum rents that may be charged for low-income units are based on the size of the unit by number of bedrooms, and are calculated in accordance with the following procedure. For each unit size, HUD will provide the Section 8 very low-income limits. HUD will also provide income adjustments for each unit size, consistent with 24 CFR part 813. An adjusted income amount for each unit size is calculated by the owner or grantee by subtracting the income adjustment from the Section 8 limit. The adjusted income amount is multiplied by 30 percent and divided by 12 to obtain the maximum monthly gross rent for each low-income unit. A monthly allowance for the utilities and services (excluding telephone) to be paid by the tenant is subtracted from the maximum monthly gross rent to obtain the maximum <PRTPAGE P="47"/>monthly rent that may be charged for low-income units. Information to be provided by HUD will be available from the responsible HUD Field Office.</P>
              <P>(3) The initial monthly allowance for utilities and services to be paid by the tenant must be approved by HUD. Subsequent calculations of this allowance must be approved by the grantee in connection with its review and approval of rent schedules under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The maximum monthly rent must be recalculated annually, and may change as changes in the Section 8 very low-income limit, the income adjustments, or the monthly allowance for utilities and services warrant.</P>
              <P>(4) The grantee must review and approve any schedule of rents proposed by the owner for low-income units. Any schedule submitted by an owner within the permissible maximum will be deemed approved, unless the grantee informs the owner, within 60 days after receiving the schedule, that it is disapproved.</P>
              <P>(5) Any increase in rents for low-income units is subject to the provisions of outstanding leases, in any event, the owner must provide tenants of those units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementing any increase in rents.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reexamination of tenant income and composition.</E> (1) The owner shall reexamine the income of each tenant household living in low-income units at least once a year. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995 the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(2) If this reexamination indicates that the tenant no longer qualifies as a low-income household, the owner must take one of the following actions, as appropriate: (i) If the unit occupied by the tenant must be leased to a low- income household to maintain the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement, the owner must notify the tenant that it must move when the current lease expires or six months after the date of the notification, whichever is later; (ii) If the owner can meet this percentage without the unit occupied by the tenant (for example, by designating another comparable unit as a low-income unit), the owner may continue to lease to that tenant, but is free to renegotiate the rent at the expiration of the current lease.</P>
              <P>(3) For provisions related to termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR 812.9, and also 24 CFR 812.10 for provisions related to certain assistance to mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions related to deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Affirmative fair housing marketing.</E> Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, Form HUD-935.2, and all fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the Plan and the requirements is to provide for affirmative marketing through the provision of information regarding the availability of units in projects assisted. Affirmative marketing steps consist of good faith efforts to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons from all racial, ethnic and gender groups in the housing market area to the available housing.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Management and maintenance functions.</E> The owner must perform all management and maintenance functions in compliance with equal opportunity requirements. These functions include selection of tenants, reexamination of family income, evictions and other terminations of tenancy, and all ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and repairs, including replacement of capital items.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Residency preferences.</E> Local residency requirements are prohibited. Local residency preferences may be applied in selecting tenants only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with affirmative fair housing marketing objectives and the owner's HUD-<PRTPAGE P="48"/>approved AFHM Plan. With respect to any residency preference, persons expected to reside in the community as a result of current or planned employment will be treated as residents.</P>

The amount to be repaid shall be reduced by 10 percent for each full year in excess of 10 years that intervened between the beginning of the term of the owner-grantee agreement and the violation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on distributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.</P>
              <P>(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation following the effective date of the Contract after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until cost certification, where applicable, is completed. Distributions may not exceed the following maximum returns:</P>

              <P>(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) For projects for non-elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by HUD at cost certification (see § 880.405) unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution by cost certification documentation in accordance with HUD mortgage insurance procedures.</P>
              <P>(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.</P>

              <P>(e) If HUD determines at any time that project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted <PRTPAGE P="52"/>distribution, HUD may require the excess to be placed in an account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess funds must be remitted to HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) Owners of small projects or partially-assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this section will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance program provisions.</P>
              <P>(h) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus cash, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.</P>
              <P>(i) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (i) is preempted to the extent provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.</P>

For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 880.601(a); (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to the contract administrator. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of the contract administrator in accordance with HUD guidelines. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects, HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC or the Contract, as appropriate, to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and for 24 CFR part 883 projects, HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC and the Agency <PRTPAGE P="56"/>may agree to an amendment to the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, if:</P>
              <P>(1) HUD determines (for 24 CFR part 883 projects, HUD and the Agency determine) that the restoration is justified by demand,</P>
              <P>(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his obligations under the Contract, and</P>
              <P>(3) Contract and budget authority is available.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all Contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of assistance for failure to submit evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status.</E> If an owner who is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with 24 CFR part 5 because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in 24 CFR part 5, the owner shall comply with the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</E> The regulations of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), apply to this section.</P>

For private-owner/HUD and PHA-owner/HUD projects, HUD is responsible for administration of the Contract. The PHA or HUD may contract with another entity for the performance of some or all of its contract administration functions.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Rights of Owner if PHA defaults under Agreement or Contract.</E> The ACC, the Agreement and the Contract will provide that, in the event of failure of the PHA to comply with the Agreement or Contract with the owner, the owner will have the right, if he is not in default, to demand that HUD investigate. HUD will first give the PHA a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action. If HUD determines that a substantial default exists, HUD will assume the PHA's rights and obligations under the Agreement or Contract and meet the obligations of the PHA under the Agreement or Contract including the obligations to enter into the Contract.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rights of HUD if PHA defaults under ACC.</E> The ACC will provide that, if the PHA fails to comply with any of its obligations, HUD may determine that there is a substantial default and require the PHA to assign to HUD all of its rights and interests under the Contract; however, HUD will continue to pay annual contributions in accordance with the terms of the ACC and the Contract. Before determining that a PHA is in substantial default, HUD will give the PHA a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rights of PHA and HUD if Owner defaults under Contract.</E> (1) The Contract will provide that if the PHA determines that the owner is in default under the Contract, the PHA will notify the owner and lender, with a copy to HUD, (i) of the actions required to be taken to cure the default, (ii) of the remedies to be applied by the PHA including specific performance under the Contract, abatement of housing assistance payments and recovery of overpayments, where appropriate, and (iii) that if he fails to cure the default, the PHA has the right to terminate the Contract or to take other corrective action, in its discretion or as directed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(2) If the PHA is the lender, the Contract will also provide that HUD has an independent right to determine whether the owner is in default and to take corrective action and apply appropriate remedies, except that HUD will not have the right to terminate the Contract without proceeding in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) The Contract will provide that the owner will notify each assisted family, at least 90 days before the end of the Contract term, of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent which may occur as a result of its expiration. If the Contract is to be renewed but with a reduction in the number of units covered by it, this notice shall be given to each family who will no longer be assisted under the Contract.</P>
              <P>(b) The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address; and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family shall be the date on which the owner mails the first class letter provided for in this paragraph, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.</P>

              <P>(c) The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the Contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the owner will be free (to the extent the project is not otherwise regulated by HUD) to alter the rent without HUD approval, but subject to any applicable requirements or restrictions under the lease or under State or local law. The notice shall also state: <PRTPAGE P="58"/>(1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent which will be charged following the expiration of the Contract; (2) the difference between the rent and the Total Tenant Payment toward rent under the Contract; and (3) the date the Contract will expire.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section with an example of the text of the notice attached.</P>
              <P>(e) This section applies to all Contracts entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed on or after October 1, 1981, or entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed before October 1, 1981, but renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketing.</E> (1) The owner must commence diligent marketing activities in accordance with the Agreement not later than 90 days prior to the anticipated date of availability for occupancy of the first unit of the project.</P>
              <P>(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan and all Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity requirements. The purpose of the Plan and requirements is to assure that eligible families of similar income in the same housing market area have an equal opportunity to apply and be selected for a unit in projects assisted under this part regardless of their race, color, creed, religion, sex or national origin.</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to non-elderly family units, the owner must undertake marketing activities in advance of marketing to other prospective tenants in order to provide opportunities to reside in the project to non-elderly families who are least likely to apply, as determined in the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, and to non-elderly families expected to reside in the community by reason of current or planned employment.</P>
              <P>(4) At the time of Contract execution, the owner must submit a list of leased and unleased units, with justification for the unleased units, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Management and maintenance.</E> The owner is responsible for all management functions, including determining eligibility of applicants, selection of tenants, reexamination and verification of family income and composition, determination of family rent (total tenant payment, tenant rent and utility reimbursement), collection of rent, termination of tenancy and eviction, and performance of all repair and maintenance functions (including ordinary and extraordinary maintenance), and replacement of capital items. (See part 5 of this title.) All functions must be performed in accordance with applicable equal opportunity requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting for services.</E> (1) For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects, with HUD approval, the owner may contract with a private or public entity (except the contract administrator) for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) For 24 CFR part 883 projects, with approval of the Agency, the owner may contract with a private or public entity (but not with the Agency unless temporarily necessary for the Agency to protect its financial interest and to uphold its program responsibilities where no alternative management agent is immediately available) for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) However, such an arrangement does not relieve the owner of responsibility for these services and duties.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of financial and operating statements.</E> After execution of the Contract, the owner must submit to the contract adminstrator:</P>
              <P>(1) Financial information in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart H; and</P>
              <P>(2) Other statements as to project operation, financial conditions and occupancy as HUD may require pertinent to administration of the Contract and monitoring of project operations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of project funds.</E> (1) Project funds must be used for the benefit of the project, to make required deposits to the replacement reserve in accordance with § 880.602 and to provide distributions to the owner as provided in <PRTPAGE P="59"/>§ 880.205, § 881.205 of this chapter, or § 883.306 of this chapter, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects:</P>
              <P>(i) Any remaining project funds must be deposited with the mortgagee or other HUD-approved depository in an interest-bearing residual receipts account. Withdrawals from this account will be made only for project purposes and with the approval of HUD.</P>
              <P>(ii) Partially-assisted projects are exempt from the provisions of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this paragraph (e) will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) For 24 CFR part 883 projects:</P>
              <P>(i) Any remaining project funds must be deposited with the Agency, other mortgagee or other Agency-approved depository in an interest-bearing account. Withdrawals from this account may be made only for project purposes and with the approval of the Agency.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this paragraph will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance provisions, except in the case of partially-assisted projects which are subject to the applicable mortgage insurance provisions.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Selection and admission of assisted tenants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Application.</E> The owner must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Both the owner (or designee) and the applicant must complete and sign the application. For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects, on request, the owner must furnish copies of all applications to HUD and the PHA, if applicable. For 24 CFR part 883 projects, on request, the owner must furnish to the Agency or HUD copies of all applications received.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.</E> The owner is responsible for obtaining and verifying information related to income eligibility in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and evidence related to citizenship and eligible immigration status in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, to determine whether the applicant is eligible for assistance in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, and to select families for admission to the program, which includes giving selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.</P>
              <P>(1) If the owner determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the owner will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit is available, the owner will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications are being accepted for that reason, provided the owner complies with the procedures for informing applicants about admission preferences as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.</P>
              <P>(2) If the owner determines that an applicant is ineligible on the basis of income or family composition, or because of failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or because of failure by an applicant to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR parts 5 and 813), or that the owner is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the owner will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination and its reasons, and that the applicant has the right to meet with the owner or managing agent in accordance with HUD requirements. Where the owner is a PHA, the applicant may request an informal hearing. If the PHA determines that the applicant is not eligible, the PHA will notify the applicant and inform the applicant that he or she has the right to request HUD review of the PHA's determination. The applicant may also exercise other rights if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin. See 24 CFR part 5 for the informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal preference or the failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status and for notice requirements where assistance is terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced based on wage and claim information obtained by HUD from a State Wage Information Collection Agency.</P>

              <P>(3) Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, <PRTPAGE P="61"/>must be maintained and retained for three years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reexamination of family income and composition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least every 12 months. After consultation with the family and upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and must carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose the verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 and verify the immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See 24 CFR part 5 for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995, when a new family member has been added, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of the citizenship or eligible immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Continuation of housing assistance payments.</E> A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments continues until the Total Tenant Payment equals the contract rent plus any utility allowance. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. See 24 CFR part 5 for provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status and also for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination.</E> An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The provisions of this section apply to all decisions by an owner to terminate the tenancy of a family residing in a unit under Contract during or at the end of the family's lease term.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Entitlement of Families to occupancy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Grounds.</E> The owner may not terminate any tenancy except upon the following grounds:</P>
              <P>(i) Material noncompliance with the lease;</P>
              <P>(ii) Material failure to carry out obligations under any State landlord and tenant act;</P>
              <P>(iii) Criminal activity by a covered person in accordance with sections 5.858 and 5.859, or alcohol abuse by a covered person in accordance with section 5.860. If necessary, criminal records can be obtained for lease enforcement purposes under section 5.903(d)(3).</P>
              <P>(iv) Other good cause, which may include the refusal of a family to accept an approved modified lease form (see paragraph (d) of this section). No termination by an owner will be valid to the extent it is based upon a lease or a provisions of State law permitting termination of a tenancy solely because of expiration of an initial or subsequent renewal term. All terminations must also be in accordance with the provisions of any State and local landlord tenant law and paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of good cause.</E> The conduct of a tenant cannot be deemed “other good cause” under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section unless the owner has given the family prior notice that the grounds constitute a basis for termination of tenancy. The notice must be served on the family in the same manner as that provided for termination notices under paragraph (c) of this section and State and local law.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Material noncompliance.</E> (i) Material noncompliance with the lease includes:</P>
              <P>(A) One or more substantial violations of the lease; or</P>
              <P>(B) Repeated minor violations of the lease that disrupt the livability of the building; adversely affect the health or safety of any person or the right of any tenant to the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and related facilities; interfere with the management of the building or have an adverse financial effect on the building.</P>
              <P>(ii) Failure of the family to timely submit all required information on family income and composition, including failure to submit required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), failure to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), failure to sign and submit consent forms (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or knowingly providing incomplete or inaccurate information, shall constitute a substantial violation of the lease.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination notice.</E> (1) The owner must give the family a written notice of any proposed termination of tenancy, stating the grounds and that the tenancy is terminated on a specified date and advising the family that it has an opportunity to respond to the owner.</P>

              <P>(2) When a termination notice is issued for other good cause (paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section), the notice will be effective, and it will so state, at the end of a term and in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease, but in no case earlier than 30 days after receipt by the family of the <PRTPAGE P="64"/>notice. Where the termination notice is based on material noncompliance with the lease or material failure to carry out obligations under a State landlord and tenant act pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the time of service must be in accord with the lease and State law.</P>
              <P>(3) In any judicial action instituted to evict the family, the owner may not rely on any grounds which are different from the reasons set forth in the notice.</P>
              <P>(4) See 24 CFR part 5 for provisions related to termination of assistance because of failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, including informal hearing procedures and also for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(5) In actions or potential actions to terminate tenancy, the owner shall follow 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Modification of Lease form.</E> The owner, with the prior approval of HUD or, for a 24 CFR part 883 project, the Agency, may modify the terms and conditions of the lease form effective at the end of the initial term or a successive term, by serving an appropriate notice on the family, together with the offer of a revised lease or an addendum revising the existing lease. This notice and offer must be received by the family at least 30 days prior to the last date on which the family has the right to terminate the tenancy without being bound by the modified terms and conditions. The family may accept the modified terms and conditions by executing the offered revised lease or addendum, or may reject the modified terms and conditions by giving the owner written notice in accordance with the lease that the family intends to terminate the tenancy. Any increase in rent must in all cases be governed by § 880.609 and other applicable HUD regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Security deposits.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) At the time of the initial execution of the lease, the owner will require each family to pay a security deposit in an amount equal to one month's Total Tenant Payment or $50, whichever is greater. The family is expected to pay the security deposit from its own resources and/or other public sources. The owner may collect the security deposit on an installment basis.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner must place the security deposits in a segregated, interest-bearing account. The balance of this account must at all times be equal to the total amount collected from the families then in occupancy, plus any accrued interest. The owner must comply with any applicable State and local laws concerning interest payments on security deposits.</P>
              <P>(c) In order to be considered for the return of the security deposit, a family which vacates its unit will provide the owner with its forwarding address or arrange to pick up the refund.</P>
              <P>(d) The owner, subject to State and local law and the requirements of this paragraph, may use the security deposit, plus any accrued interest, as reimbursement for any unpaid family contribution or other amount which the family owes under the lease. Within 30 days (or shorter time if required by State, or local law) after receiving notification of the family's forwarding address, the owner must:</P>
              <P>(1) Refund to a family owing no rent or other amount under the lease the full amount of the security deposit, plus accrued interest;</P>

              <P>(2) Provide to a family owing rent or other amount under the lease a list itemizing any unpaid rent, damages to the unit, and estimated costs for repair, along with a statement of the <PRTPAGE P="65"/>family's rights under State and local law. If the amount which the owner claims is owed by the family is less than the amount of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, the owner must refund the unused balance to the family. If the owner fails to provide the list, the family will be entitled to the refund of the full amount of the security deposit plus accrued interest.</P>
              <P>(e) In the event a disagreement arises concerning reimbursement of the security deposit, the family will have the right to present objections to the owner in an informal meeting. The owner must keep a record of any disagreements and meetings in a tenant file for inspection by the contract administrator. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the family from exercising its rights under State and local law.</P>
              <P>(f) If the security deposit, including any accrued interest, is insufficient to reimburse the owner for any unpaid tenant rent or other amount which the family owes under the lease, and the owner has provided the family with the list required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner may claim reimbursement from the contract administrator, as appropriate, for an amount not to exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount owed the owner, or</P>
              <P>(2) One month's contract rent, minus the amount of the security deposit plus accrued interest. Any reimbursement under this section will be applied first toward any unpaid tenant rent due under the lease. No reimbursement may be claimed for unpaid rent for the period after termination of the tenancy.</P>

The owner must submit to the contract administrator required supporting data, financial statements and certifications.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Overall limitation.</E> Any adjustments of contract rents for a unit after Contract execution or cost certification, where applicable, must not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and comparable unassisted units except to the extent that the differences existed with respect to the contract rents set at Contract execution or cost certification, where applicable.</P>

Whenever a Utility Allowance for a unit is adjusted, the owner will promptly notify affected families and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant rent and the amount of the housing assistance payment for the unit.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Election by owners of eligible projects.</E> (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:</P>
              <P>(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or</P>
              <P>(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list on the basis of having made the election.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">HUD approval of election not required.</E> (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evidence supporting project eligibility.</E> Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary sources.</E> Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Secondary sources.</E> Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households <PRTPAGE P="68"/>where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sources in conflict.</E> If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide <E T="03">clear evidence</E> of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of—</P>
              <P>(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and</P>

              <P>(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Secondary preferences.</E> An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference <PRTPAGE P="69"/>for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Availability of units to families without regard to preference.</E> An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or</P>
              <P>(2) The owner has <E T="03">not</E> adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.</E> To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:</P>
              <P>(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 880.601(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prohibition of evictions.</E> An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).</P>

              <P>(a) Covered housing providers must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan that meets the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e).</P>
              <P>(b) In order to facilitate emergency transfers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, covered housing providers have discretion to adopt new, and modify any existing, admission preferences or transfer waitlist priorities.</P>
              <P>(c) In addition to following requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), when a safe unit is not immediately available for a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who qualifies for an emergency transfer, covered housing providers must:</P>
              <P>(1) Review the covered housing provider's existing inventory of units and determine when the next vacant unit may be available; and</P>
              <P>(2) Provide a listing of nearby HUD subsidized rental properties, with or without preference for persons of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and contact information for the local HUD field office.</P>
              <P>(d) Each year, covered housing providers must submit to HUD data on all emergency transfers requested under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including data on the outcomes of such requests.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on distributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.</P>
              <P>(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation following the effective date of the Contract after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until cost certification, where applicable, is completed. Distributions may not exceed the following maximum returns:</P>

              <P>(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) For projects for non-elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is <PRTPAGE P="73"/>deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by HUD at cost certification (see § 881.405), unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution by cost certification documentation in accordance with HUD mortgage insurance procedures.</P>
              <P>(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.</P>
              <P>(e) If HUD determines at any time that project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted distribution, HUD may require the excess to be placed in an account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess funds must be remitted to HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) Owners of small projects or partially-assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this section will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance program provisions.</P>
              <P>(h) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus cash, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.</P>
              <P>(i) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (i) is preempted to the extent provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.</P>

              <P>(2) Subject to the rights of families under existing leases, PHAs may continue to lease units to families under Section 23 only on a month-to-month basis.</P>
              <P>(3) PHAs shall conduct annual inspections of all units to determine whether the units are decent, safe and sanitary.</P>

If an owner's units are not decent, safe and sanitary.</P>

              <P>(i) Where the owner is responsible under the terms of the lease for correcting the deficiencies, the PHA shall send the owner written notification requiring the owner to take specified corrective action within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the owner fails to comply, rent payments will be suspended. If the owner fails to comply with the first notification, he shall be notified by the PHA of the noncompliance and rent payments shall be suspended immediately. In the <PRTPAGE P="79"/>event of such suspension of rent payments, the PHA shall requisition a correspondingly lower ACC payment.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the PHA is responsible under the terms of the lease for correcting the deficiencies, the Field Office shall send written notification requiring the PHA to take specified corrective action within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the PHA fails to comply, HUD will make reduced payments to the PHA only in the amount of the rent due the owner. If the PHA fails to comply with the first notification, the PHA shall be notified of the noncompliance, and the PHA shall not receive any fees for performing management functions until the PHA has complied with the Field Office request and has corrected the noted deficiencies.</P>

              <P>(h) <E T="03">Request for rent increases.</E> An owner may submit to the PHA a request for rent increase because of increases in operating cost, when the rents to the owner, after adjustments based on provisions in the lease, are insufficient to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing. Such a request shall be supported by an audited financial statement, and the data shall clearly show that failure to obtain additional revenue will result in deterioriation of units and loss of decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families. The PHA shall inspect the units to determine whether the units are decent, safe and sanitary. Where the need for an adjustment under this paragraph is shown:</P>
              <P>(1) Subject to available contract authority and prior approval by the HUD Field Office, the PHA may grant an adjustment to the extent documented and justified for those items of expenses (excluding debt service) for which the owner is responsible under the lease.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount of the adjustment must be reasonable when compared with similar items under the Section 8 Existing Housing program.</P>

              <P>(3) The adjusted amount for expenses shall not exceed the result of applying the appropriate Section 8 Existing Housing Annual Adjustment Factor (24 CFR part 888) most recently published by HUD in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to the appropriate expense base in effect under the lease prior to this adjustment.</P>
              <P>(4) The adjustment shall not be retroactive to pay for costs that the owner had previously incurred.</P>

Existing structures of various types may be appropriate for this program, including single-family houses, multi-family structures and group homes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Ineligible properties.</E> (1) Nursing homes, units within the grounds of penal, reformatory, medical, mental and similar public or private institutions, and facilities providing continual psychiatric, medical or nursing services are not eligible for assistance under the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.<PRTPAGE P="80"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Housing owned by a State or unit of general local government is not eligible for assistance under this program.</P>

              <P>(4) Single room occupancy (SRO) housing may not be utilized unless:</P>
              <P>(i) The property is located in an area in which there is a significant demand for such units as determined by the HUD Field Office; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA and the unit of general local government in which the property is located approve of such units being utilized for such purpose.</P>
              <P>(5) No Section 8 assistance may be provided with respect to any unit occupied by an Owner; however, cooperatives will be considered as rental housing for purposes of the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.</P>

The fee for the costs of PHA administration is payable out of the annual contribution.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Project account.</E> (1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will contain the sum of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out for the project under the ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account when needed to cover increases in Contract Rents or decreases in Gross Family Contributions for (i) housing assistance (including vacancy) payments, (ii) the amount of the fee for PHA costs of administration, and (iii) other costs specifically approved by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Fair Market Rent limitation.</E> The Fair Market Rent Schedule for Moderate Rehabilitation is 120 percent of the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule, except that the Fair Market Rent limitation applicable to single room occupancy housing is 75 percent of the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent for a 0-bedroom unit. The initial Gross Rent for any Moderate Rehabilitation unit must not exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed except by up to 10 percent as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Additionally, to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the PHA may approve changes in the Contract Rent subsequent to execution of the Agreement which result in an initial Gross Rent which exceeds the Moderate <PRTPAGE P="82"/>Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit by up to 20 percent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception rents.</E> With HUD Field Office approval, the PHA may approve initial Gross Rents which exceed the applicable Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rents by up to 10 percent for all units of a given size in specified areas where HUD has determined that the rents for standard units suitable for the Existing Housing Program are more than 10 percent higher than the Existing Housing Fair Market Rents. The PHA must submit documentation demonstrating the necessity for such exception rents in the area to the HUD Field Office. In areas where HUD has approved the use of exception rents for 0-bedroom units, the single room occupancy housing exception rent will be 75 percent of the exception rent applicable to Moderate Rehabilitation 0-bedroom units.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination Initial Contract Rents.</E> (1) The initial Contract Rent and base rent for each unit must be computed in accordance with HUD requirements. These amounts may be determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), or in accordance with an alternative method prescribed by HUD. However, the initial Contract Rent may in no event be more than—</P>
              <P>(i) The Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed, minus</P>
              <P>(ii) Any applicable allowance for utilities and other services attributable to the unit.</P>
              <P>(2) When the initial Contract Rent is computed under this paragraph, the rent will be equal to the base rent plus the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan (but not more than the maximum stated in paragraph (c)(1)). The base rent must be calculated using the rent charged for the unit or the estimated costs to the Owner of owning, managing and maintaining the rehabilitated unit. The monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan must be calculated using:</P>
              <P>(i) The actual interest rate on the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner,</P>
              <P>(ii) The HUD-FHA maximum interest rate for multifamily housing (or another rate prescribed by HUD) for rehabilitation costs paid by the Owner out of nonborrowed funds, and</P>
              <P>(iii) At least a 15 year loan term, except that if the total amount of rehabilitation is less than $15,000, the actual loan term will be used for the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner. (HUD Field Offices may authorize loan terms which differ from the above in accordance with HUD requirements.)</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Changes in Initial Contract Rents during rehabilitation.</E> (1) The initial Contract Rents established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract except under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) When, during rehabilitation, work items (including substantial and necessary design changes) which (A) could not reasonably have been anticipated or are necessitated by a change in local codes or ordinances, and (B) were not listed in the work write-up prepared or approved by the PHA, are subsequently required and approved by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the actual cost of the rehabilitation performed is less than that estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement or the actual, certified costs are more than estimated due to unforeseen factors beyond the owner's control (e.g., strikes, weather delays or unexpected delays caused by local governments).</P>
              <P>(iii) When the PHA (or HUD) approves changes in financing.</P>
              <P>(iv) When the actual relocation payments made by the Owner to temporarily relocated Families varies from the cost estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement.</P>
              <P>(v) When necessary to correct errors in computation of the base and Contract Rents to comply with the HUD requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) Should changes occur as specified in paragraph (d)(1) (either an increase or decrease), the PHA will approve any necessary change in work and amendment of the work write-up and cost estimate, recalculate the initial Contract Rents in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and amend the Contract or Agreement, as appropriate, to reflect the revised rents.</P>

              <P>(3) In establishing the revised Contract Rents, the PHA must determine <PRTPAGE P="83"/>that the resulting Gross Rents do not exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or the exception rent in effect at the time of execution of the Agreement. The Fair Market Rent or exception rent, as appropriate, may only be exceeded when the PHA determines in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section that it will be necessary for the revised Gross Rent to exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent. Should this determination be made, the PHA may not execute a revised Agreement or Contract for Gross Rents exceeding the Fair Market Rents by more than 10 percent until it receives HUD Field Office approval. The HUD Field Office may approve revised Gross Rents which exceed the Fair Market Rents by up to 20 percent for reasons specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon proper justification by the PHA of the necessity for the increase.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Annual and special adjustments.</E> Contract Rents will be adjusted as provided in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section upon submittal to the PHA by the Owner of a revised schedule of Contract Rents, provided that the unit is in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and that the Owner is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Lease and Contract. Subject to the foregoing, adjustments of Contract Rents will be as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The Annual Adjustment Factors which are published annually by HUD (see Schedule C, 24 CFR part 888) will be utilized. On or after each annual anniversary date of the Contract, the Contract Rents may be adjusted in accordance with HUD procedures, effective for the month following the submittal by the Owner of a revised schedule of Contract Rents. The changes in rent as a result of the adjustment cannot exceed the amount established by multiplying the Annual Adjustment Factor by the base rents. However, if the amounts borrowed to finance the rehabilitation costs or to finance purchase of the property are subject to a variable rate or are otherwise renegotiable, Contract Rents may be adjusted in accordance with other procedures as prescribed by HUD, and specified in the Contract, provided that the adjusted Contract Rents cannot exceed the rents established by multiplying the Annual Adjustment Factor by the Contract Rents. Adjusted Contract Rents must then be examined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and may be adjusted accordingly. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward, as may be appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Special Adjustments.</E> (i) A special adjustment, to the extent determined by HUD to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the unit which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates and utilities not covered by regulated rates, may be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD. Subject to appropriations, a special adjustment may also be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD when HUD determines that a project is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent, and not specific to a particular project, and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity. HUD may, on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the current gross rents for each unit size under a <PRTPAGE P="84"/>Housing Assistance Payments Contract, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs and reserves required for the Owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to HUD for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Prior to approval of a special adjustment to cover the cost of physical improvements, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4.</P>
              <P>(ii) The aforementioned special rent adjustments will only be approved if and to the extent the Owner clearly demonstrates that these general increases have caused increases in the owners operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Owner must submit financial information to the PHA which clearly supports the increase. For Contracts of more than twenty units, the Owner must submit audited financial information.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overall limitation.</E> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, adjustments as provided in this section must not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by the PHA (and approved by HUD in the case of adjustments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section). However, unless the rents have been adjusted in accordance with § 882.409, this limitation should not be construed to prohibit differences in rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent that differences existed with respect to the initial Contract Rents.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Vacancies from execution of Contract to initial occupancy.</E> If a Contract unit which has been rehabilitated in accordance with this Program is not leased within 15 days of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner will be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract, provided that the Owner (1) has complied with §§ 882.506(d) and 882.508(c); (2) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to the PHA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Vacancies after initial occupancy.</E> (1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner may receive the housing assistance payments due under the Contract for so much of the month in which the Family vacates the unit as the unit remains vacant. Should the unit continue to remain vacant, the Owner may receive from the PHA a housing assistance payment in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding an additional month. However, if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period, the payment must be reduced to an amount which, when added to the Family's payment, does not exceed 80 percent of the Contract Rent. Any such excess must be reimbursed by the Owner to the PHA. The Owner will not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the Owner:</P>
              <P>(i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified the PHA of the vacancy or prospective vacancy, and</P>
              <P>(ii) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, the Owner will not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the PHA determines that the Owner complied with all requirements of the Contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.</E> The Owner will not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section if the Owner is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the <PRTPAGE P="85"/>HCD Act of 1974 or payments for unpaid rent under § 882.414 (Security and Utility Deposits)).</P>

              <P>(b) If a Family vacates the unit, the Owner, subject to State and local law, may use the security deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid Tenant Rent or other amount which the Family owes under the Lease.

              <P>(iii) The unit(s) has been rehabilitated in accordance with the applicable zoning, building, housing and other codes, ordinances or regulations, as modified by any waivers obtained from the appropriate officials;</P>
              <P>(iv) The unit(s) are in compliance with part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R of this title.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any unit(s) built prior to 1973 are in compliance with § 882.404(c)(3) and § 882.404(c)(4).</P>
              <P>(v) If applicable, the Owner has complied with the provisions of the Agreement relating to the payment of not less than prevailing wage rates and that to the best of the Owner's knowledge and belief there are no claims of underpayment concerning alleged violations of said provisions of the Agreement. In the event there are any such pending claims to the knowledge of the Owner, PHA or HUD, the Owner will be required to place sufficient amount in escrow, as determined by the PHA or HUD, to assure such payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Actual cost and rehabilitation loan certifications.</E> The Owner must provide the PHA with a certification of the costs incurred for the rehabilitation and any temporary relocation as well as the interest rate and term of any rehabilitation loan. The Owner must certify that these are the actual costs, interest rate, and term.</P>
              <FP>The PHA must review for completeness and accuracy and accept these certifications subject to the right of post audit. The PHA must then establish the Contract Rents as provided in § 882.408 which will be subject to reduction based on a post audit.</FP>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review and inspections.</E> The PHA must review the evidence of completion for compliance with paragraph (b) of this section. The PHA also must inspect the unit(s) to be assisted to determine that the unit(s) has been completed in accordance with the Agreement and meets the Housing Quality Standards or other standards approved by HUD for the Program. If the inspection discloses defects or deficiencies, the inspector must report these in detail.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Acceptance.</E> (1) If the PHA determines from the review and inspection that the unit(s) has been completed in accordance with the Agreement, the unit(s) will be accepted.</P>

              <P>(2) If there are any items of delayed completion which are minor items or which are incomplete because of weather conditions, and in any case which do not preclude or affect occupancy, and all other requirements of the Agreement have been met, the unit(s) must be accepted. An escrow fund determined by the PHA to be sufficient to assure completion for items of delayed completion must be required, as well as a written agreement between the PHA and the Owner, to be included as an exhibit to the Contract, specifying the schedule for completion. If the items are not completed within the agreed time period, the PHA may <PRTPAGE P="87"/>terminate the Contract or exercise other rights under the Contract.</P>
              <P>(3) If other deficiencies exist, the PHA must determine whether and to what extent the deficiencies are correctable, and whether the Contract Rents should be reduced. The Owner must be notified of the PHA's decision. If the corrections required by the PHA are possible, the PHA and the Owner must enter into an agreement for the correction of the deficiencies within a specified time. If the deficiencies are corrected within the agreed period of time, the PHA must accept the unit(s).</P>
              <P>(4) Otherwise, the unit(s) may not be accepted, and the Owner must be notified with a statement of the reasons for nonacceptance.</P>

If the PHA determines that an adjustment should be made in its Schedule of Allowances or if it establishes a separate schedule for a building which will change the allowance, the PHA must then determine the amounts of adjustments to be made in the amount of rent to be paid by affected Families and the amount of housing assistance payments and must notify the Owners and Families accordingly. Any adjustment to the Allowance must be implemented no later than at the Family's next reexamination or at lease renewal, whichever is earlier.</P>

              <P>(2) The notice of termination must:</P>
              <P>(i) State the reasons for such termination with enough specificity to enable the Family to prepare a defense.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitation on leasing to ineligible Families.</E> Owners must lease all assisted units under Contract to Eligible Families. Leasing of vacant, assisted units to ineligible tenants is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including suspension or debarment from HUD programs and reduction of the number of units under the Contract, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Once the PHA has determined that a violation exists, the PHA must notify HUD of its determination and the suggested remedies. At the direction of HUD, the PHA must take the appropriate action.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction for failure to lease to Eligible Families.</E> If, at any time beginning six months after the effective date of the Contract, the Owner fails for a period of six continuous months to have at least 90 percent of the assisted units leased or available for leasing by Eligible Families (because families initially eligible have become ineligible), the PHA may, on at least 30 days' notice, reduce the number of units covered by the Contract. The PHA may reduce the number of units to the number of units actually leased or available for leasing by Eligible Families plus 10 percent (rounded up).

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial determination of family eligibility.</E> (1) The PHA is responsible for receipt and review of applications, and determination of family eligibility for participation in accordance with HUD regulations (see 24 CFR parts 5, 750 and 760). The PHA is responsible for verifying the sources and amount of the family's income and other information necessary for determining income eligibility and the amount of the assistance payments.</P>
              <P>(2) PHA records on applicants and Families selected to participate must be maintained so as to provide HUD with racial, gender, and ethnic data.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection of Families for participation.</E> When vacancies occur, the PHA will refer to the Owner one or more appropriate size Families on its waiting list. The PHA must select Families for participation in accordance with the provisions of the Program and in accordance with the PHA's application, including any PHA requirement or preferences as approved by HUD. The PHA must select Families eligible for housing assistance payments currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation under the Program without requiring that these Families be placed on the waiting list. Notwithstanding the fact that the PHA may not be accepting additional applications for participation because of the length of the waiting list, the PHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for partcipation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, unless the PHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions under this part, that—</P>
              <P>(1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference and</P>
              <P>(2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for assistance before other applicants on the waiting list.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Owner selection of Families.</E> All vacant units under Contract must be rented to Eligible Families referred by the PHA from its waiting list. However, if the PHA is unable to refer a sufficient number of interested applicants on the waiting list to the Owner within 30 days of the Owner's notification to the PHA of a vacancy, the Owner may advertise or solicit applications from Low-Income Families and refer such Families to the PHA to determine eligibility. Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection, the Owner may refuse any family, provided that the Owner does not unlawfully discriminate.However, the owner must not deny program assistance or admission to an applicant based on the fact that the applicant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the applicant otherwise qualifies for assistance or admission. Should the Owner reject a Family, and should the Family believe that the Owner's rejection was <PRTPAGE P="90"/>the result of unlawful discrimination, the Family may request the assistance of the PHA in resolving the issue. If the issue cannot be resolved promptly, the Family may file a complaint with HUD, and the PHA may refer the Family to the next available Moderate Rehabilitation unit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Briefing of Families.</E> (1) When a Family is initially determined to be eligible for housing assistance payments or is selected for participation in accordance with this section, the PHA must provide the Family with information as to the Tenant Rent and the PHA's schedule of Utility Allowances. Each Family must also, either in group or individual sessions, be provided with a full explanation of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Family and Owner responsibilities under the Lease and Contract;</P>
              <P>(ii) Significant aspects of the applicable State and local laws;</P>
              <P>(iii) Significant aspects of Federal, State and local fair housing laws;</P>
              <P>(iv) The fact that the subsidy is tied to the unit and the Family must occupy a unit rehabilitated under the Program;</P>
              <P>(v) The Family's options under the Program should the Family be required to move due to an increase or decrease in Family size; and</P>
              <P>(vi) The advisability and availability of blood lead level screening for children under 6 years of age and HUD's lead-based paint requirements in part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R of this title.</P>
              <P>(2) For all Families to be temporarily relocated, the briefing must include a discussion of the relocation policies.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Continued participation of Family when Contract is terminated.</E> If an Owner evicts an assisted family in violation of the Contract or otherwise breaches the Contract, and the Contract for the unit is terminated, and if the Family was not at fault and is eligible for continued assistance, the Family may continue to receive housing assistance through the conversion of the Moderate Rehabilitation assistance to ten-
              </P>
              <FP>ant-based assistance under the Section 8 certificate or voucher program. The Family must then be issued a certificate or voucher, and treated as any participant in the tenant-based programs under 24 CFR part 982, and must be assisted by the PHA in finding a suitable unit. All requirements of 24 CFR part 982 will be applicable except that the term of any housing assistance payments contract may not extend beyond the term of the initial Moderate Rehabilitation Contract. If the Family is determined ineligible for continued assistance, the certificate or voucher may be offered to the next Family on the PHA's waiting list. The unit will remain under the Moderate Rehabilitation ACC which provides for such a conversion of the units; therefore no amendment to the ACC will be necessary to convert to the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs.</FP>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Families determined by the PHA to be ineligible.</E> If a Family is determined to be ineligible in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved application, either at the application stage or after assistance has been provided on behalf of the Family, the PHA shall promptly notify the Family by letter of the determination and the reasons for it and the letter shall state that the Family has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing. If, after conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the Family is ineligible, it shall notify the Family in writing. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the Family from exercising its other rights if it believes it is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, familial status, or national origin. The informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal selection preference under § 882.517 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section. The informal hearing requirements for denial and termination of assistance on <PRTPAGE P="91"/>the basis of ineligible immigration status are contained in 24 CFR part 5.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The PHA must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once every 12 months. After consultation with the family and upon verification of the information, the PHA must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate (see § 882.213). The PHA must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the PHA must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the PHA shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the PHA shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning verification of immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> If the PHA receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the PHA must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent, and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See part 5, subpart B, of this title for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995 when there is a new family member, the PHA shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Obligation to supply information.</E> The family must supply such certification, release, information or documentation as the PHA or HUD determine to be necessary, including submission of required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status, submission of social security numbers and verifying documentation, submission of signed consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, and submissions required for an annual or interim reexamination of family income and composition. See 24 CFR part 5.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuation of housing assistance payments.</E> A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments shall continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Gross Rent. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as <PRTPAGE P="92"/>provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance when the PHA determines that a family member is not a U.S. citizen or does not have eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR parts 5 and 982 for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement to deny admission</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of drug criminals.</E> (i) The PHA must prohibit admission to the program of an applicant for three years from the date of termination of tenancy if any household member's federally assisted housing tenancy has been terminated for drug-<PRTPAGE P="93"/>related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:</P>
              <P>(A) The household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity and whose tenancy was terminated has successfully completed an approved supervised drug rehabilitation program, or</P>
              <P>(B) The circumstances leading to the termination of tenancy no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must establish standards that permanently prohibit admission to the program if any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission of a household to the program if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug or that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's pattern of illegal use of a drug, as defined in § 5.100 of this title, may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of sex offenders.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In this screening of applicants, the PHA must perform criminal history background checks necessary to determine whether any household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement in the State where the housing is located and in other States where household members are known to have resided.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to deny admission</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of other criminals.</E> The PHA may prohibit admission of a household to the program under standards established by the PHA if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaged in or has engaged in during a reasonable time before the admission decision:</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Sufficient evidence.</E> If the PHA has denied admission to an applicant because a member of the household engaged in criminal activity in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the PHA may reconsider the applicant if the PHA has sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in criminal activity during a reasonable period, as determined by the PHA, before the admission decision.</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA would have “<E T="03">sufficient evidence</E>” if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which the PHA verified.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of alcohol abusers.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Terminating assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Terminating assistance for drug criminals.</E> (i) <PRTPAGE P="94"/>The PHA may terminate assistance for drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control. In addition, the PHA may terminate assistance if the PHA determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the PHA determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must immediately terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Terminating assistance for other criminals.</E> (i) The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance for a family if the PHA determines that any household member is engaged in criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right of peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may terminate assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a member of the household is:</P>
              <P>(A) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">ACC Execution.</E> (1) Before execution of the annual contributions contract (ACC), the HA must submit to the appropriate HUD field office the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Estimates of Required Annual Contributions, Forms HUD-52672 and HUD-52673;</P>
              <P>(ii) Administrative Plan, which should include:</P>

              <P>(v) The fire and building code applicable to each structure.</P>
              <P>(2) After HUD has approved the HA's application, the review and comment requirements of 24 CFR part 791 have been complied with, and the HA has submitted (and HUD has approved) the items required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, HUD and the HA must execute the ACC in the form prescribed by HUD. The initial term of the ACC must be 11 years. This term allows one year to rehabilitate the units and place them under a 10-year HAP contract. The ACC must give HUD the option to renew the ACC for an additional 10 years.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 882.403(a) (Maximum Total ACC Commitments) applies to this program.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 882.403(b) (Project account) applies to this program.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) If an owner is proposing to accomplish at least $3000 per unit of rehabilitation by including work to make the unit(s) accessible to a person with disabilities occupying the unit(s) or expected to occupy the unit(s), the PHA may approve such units not to exceed 5 percent of the units under its Program, provided that accessible units are necessary to meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 8, which implements section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The rehabilitation must make the unit(s), and access and egress to the unit(s), barrier-free with respect to the disability of the individual in residence or expected to be in residence.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must take the applications and determine the eligibility of all tenants residing in the approved units who wish to apply for the Program. After eligibility of all the tenants has been determined, the Owner must be informed of any adjustment in the number of units to be assisted. In order to make the most efficient use of housing assistance funds, an Agreement may not be entered into covering any unit occupied by a family which is not eligible to receive housing assistance payments. Therefore, the number of units approved by the PHA for a particular proposal must be adjusted to exclude any unit(s) determined by the PHA to be occupied by a family not eligible to receive housing assistance payments. Eligible Families must also be briefed at this stage as to their rights and responsibilities under the Program.</P>

              <P>(3) Should the Owner agree with the assessment of the PHA as to the work that must be accomplished, the preliminary feasibility of the proposal, and the number of units to be assisted, the Owner, with the assistance of the PHA where necessary, must prepare detailed work write-ups including specifications and plans (where necessary) so that a cost estimate may be prepared. The work write-up will describe how the deficiencies eligible for amortization through the Contract Rents are to be corrected including minimum <PRTPAGE P="98"/>acceptable levels of workmanship and materials. From this work write-up, the Owner, with the assistance of the PHA, must prepare a cost estimate for the accomplishment of all specified items.</P>
              <P>(4) The owner is responsible for selecting a competent contractor to undertake the rehabilitation. The PHA must propose opportunities for minority contractors to participate in the program.</P>
              <P>(5) The PHA must discuss with the Owner the various financing options available. The terms of the financing must be approved by the PHA in accordance with standards prescribed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(6) Before execution of the Agreement, the HA must:</P>
              <P>(i)(A) Inspect the structure to determine the specific work items that need to be accomplished to bring the units to be assisted up to the Housing Quality Standards (see § 882.803(b)) or other standards approved by HUD;</P>
              <P>(B) Conduct a feasibility analysis, and determine whether cost-effective energy conserving improvements can be added;</P>
              <P>(C) Ensure that the owner prepares the work write-ups and cost estimates required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section;</P>
              <P>(D) Determine initial base rents and contract rents;</P>
              <P>(ii) Assure that the owner has selected a contractor in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) After the financing and a contractor are obtained, determine whether the costs can be covered by initial contract rents, computed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and, if a structure contains more than 50 units to be assisted, submit the base rent and contract rent calculations to the appropriate HUD field office for review and approval in sufficient time for execution of the Agreement in a timely manner;</P>
              <P>(iv) Obtain firm commitments to provide necessary supportive services;</P>
              <P>(v) Obtain firm commitments for other resources to be provided;</P>
              <P>(vi) Determine that the $3,000 minimum amount of work requirement and other requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met;</P>
              <P>(vii) Determine eligibility of current tenants, and select the units to be assisted, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;</P>
              <P>(viii) Comply with the financing requirements in paragraph (c)(5) of this section;</P>
              <P>(ix) Assure compliance with all other applicable requirements of this subpart; and</P>
              <P>(x) If the HA determines that any structure proposed in its application is infeasible, or the HA proposes to select a different structure for any other reason, the HA must submit information for the proposed alternative structure to HUD for review and approval. HUD will rate the proposed structure in accordance with procedures in the applicable notice of funding availability. The HA may not proceed with processing for the proposed structure or execute an Agreement until HUD notifies the HA that HUD has approved the proposed alternative structure and that all requirements have been met.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Initial contract rents.</E> Section 882.408 (Initial contract rents), including the establishment of fair market rents for SRO units at 75 percent of the O-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent, applies to this program, except as follows:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) In determining the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan, in accordance with § 882.408(c)(2), a loan term of a least 10 years (instead of 15 years) may be used. The exception in § 882.408(c)(2)(iii) for using the actual loan term if the total amount of the rehabilitation is less than $15,000 continues to apply. In addition, the cost of the rehabilitation that may be included for the purpose of calculating the amount of the initial contract rent for any unit must not exceed the lower of:</P>
              <P>(A) The projected cost of rehabilitation; or</P>

              <P>(B) The per unit cost limitation that is established by <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, plus the cost of the fire and safety improvements required by 24 CFR 982.605(b)(4). HUD may, however, increase the limitation in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section by an amount HUD determines is reasonable and necessary to accommodate special local conditions, including high construction <PRTPAGE P="99"/>costs or stringent fire or building codes. HUD will publish future cost limitation changes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in the Notice of Funding Availability issued each year.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) believes that high construction costs warrant an increase in the per unit cost limitation in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the HA must demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that a higher average per unit amount is necessary to conduct this program, and that every appropriate step has been taken to contain the amount of the rehabilitation within the published per unit cost limitation established at that time, plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements. These higher amounts will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) HUD may approve a higher per unit amount up to, but not to exceed, an amount computed by multiplying the HUD-approved High Cost Percentage for Base Cities (used for computing FHA high cost area adjustments) for the area, by the current published cost limitation plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.</P>
              <P>(B) HUD may, on a structure-by-structure basis, increase the level approved in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to up to an amount computed by multiplying 2.4 by the current published cost limitation plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.</P>
              <P>(2) In approving changes to initial contract rents during rehabilitation in accordance with § 882.408(d), the revised initial contract rents may not reflect an average per unit rehabilitation cost that exceeds the limitation specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) If the structure contains four or fewer SRO units, the Fair Market Rent for that size structure (the Fair Market Rent for a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-bedroom unit, as applicable) must be used to determine the Fair Market Rent limitation instead of using the separate Fair Market Rent for each SRO unit. To determine the Fair Market Rent limitation for each SRO unit, the Fair Market Rent for the structure must be apportioned equally to each SRO unit.</P>
              <P>(4) Contract rents must not include the costs of providing supportive services, transportation, furniture, or other nonhousing costs, as determined by HUD. SRO program assistance may be used for efficiency units selected for rehabilitation under this program, but the gross rent (contract rent plus any Utility Allowance) for these units will be no higher than for SRO units (i.e., 75 percent of the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Minimizing displacement.</E> (1) Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, owners must assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under this part. To the extent feasible, residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the project upon its completion.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever a building/complex is rehabilitated, and some but not all of the rehabilitated units will be assisted upon completion of the rehabilitation, the relocation requirements described in this section apply to the occupants of each rehabilitated unit, whether or not Section 8 assistance will be provided for the unit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</P>
              <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation;</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the project upon completion; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The assistance required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A “displaced person” (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations in 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19) and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and <PRTPAGE P="103"/>sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the HA's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the HA. A person who is dissatisfied with the HA's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility of HA.</E> (1) The HA must certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations in 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the HA to comply with these provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs may be paid for with local public funds or funds available from other sources. The cost of HA advisory services for temporary relocation of tenants to be assisted under the program also may be paid from preliminary administrative funds.</P>
              <P>(3) The HA must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The HA must maintain data on the racial, ethnic, gender, and disability status of displaced persons.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. The term <E T="03">displaced person</E> includes, but may not be limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) A person who moves permanently from the real property after receiving notice requiring such move, if the move occurs on or after the date the owner submits to the HA the owner proposal that is later approved;</P>
              <P>(ii) A person, including a person who moves from the property before the date the owner submits the proposal to the HA, if the HA or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or</P>
              <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the Agreement between the owner and the HA (or, for projects assisted under subpart H of this part, after the “initiation of negotiations” (see paragraph (h) of this section)), if the move occurs before the tenant is provided a written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon its completion. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>

              <P>(a) Part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, applies to projects for which the initial application was submitted on or after the February 29, 1980, effective date. (See 24 CFR part 883, revised as of April 1, 1980.) Projects for which applications or proposals were submitted before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883 have been processed under the part 883 regulations and procedures in effect at the date of submission. If, however, the agency notified HUD within 60 calendar days of the February 29, 1980, effective date of the part 883 regulations that they chose to have the provisions of part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, apply to a specific case, it must have promptly modified the application(s) and proposal(s) to comply.</P>
              <P>(b) Subpart F of this part, dealing with the HAP contract and subpart G of this part, dealing with management, apply to all projects for which an Agreement was not executed before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883. In cases where an Agreement has been executed:</P>
              <P>(1) The Agency, owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart F of this part applicable and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract;</P>
              <P>(2) The Agency, Owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart G of this part applicable (with or without the limitation on distributions) and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract.</P>
              <P>(c) Section 883.708, Termination of Tenancy and Modifications of Leases, applies to new families who begin occupancy or execute a lease on or after 30 days following the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883. This section also applies to families not covered by the preceding sentence, including families currently under lease, who have a lease in which a renewal becomes effective on or after the 60th day following the February 29, 1980 effective date of part 883. A lease is considered renewed when both the landlord and the family fail to terminate a tenancy under a lease permitting either to terminate.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 (concerning preferences for selection of applicants) apply to all projects, regardless of when am Agreement was executed.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">General responsibilities and relationships.</E> Subject to audit and review by HUD to assure compliance with Federal requirements and objectives, Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) shall assume responsibility for project development and for supervision of the development, management and maintenance functions of owners.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certifications and HUD monitoring.</E> (1) Generally, when reviewing any of the certifications of an HFA required by this part, HUD shall accept the certification as correct. If HUD has substantial reason to question the correctness of any element in a certification, HUD shall promptly bring the matter to the attention of the HFA and ask it to provide documentation supporting the certifications. When the HFA provides such evidence, HUD will act in accordance with the HFA's judgment or evaluation unless HUD determines that the certification is clearly not supported by the documentation.</P>

              <P>(2) HUD will periodically monitor the activities of HFA's participating under this part only with respect to Section 8 <PRTPAGE P="106"/>or other HUD programs. This monitoring is intended primarily to ensure that certifications submitted and projects operated under this part reflect appropriate compliance with Federal law and requirements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on distributions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.</P>
              <P>(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation following the effective date of the Contract and after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until the HFA certification of project costs, (See § 883.411), where applicable, has been submitted to HUD. The HFA must certify that distributions will not exceed the following maximum returns:</P>

              <P>(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value, in subsequent years, as determined in accordance with HUD guidelines, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The HFA may approve a lesser increase or no increase in subsequent years' distributions.</P>

              <P>(2) For projects for non-elderly families the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value, in subsequent years, as determined in accordance with HUD guidelines, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with a Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The HFA may approve a lesser increase or no increase in subsequent years' distributions.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by the HFA at cost certification (See § 883.411), or as specified in the Proposal where cost certification is not required, unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution through cost certification documentation accepted by the HFA.</P>
              <P>(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.</P>
              <P>(e) If the HFA determines at any time that surplus project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted distributions, the HFA may require the excess to be placed in a separate account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess project funds must be remitted to HUD.</P>

              <P>(f) Owners of small projects or partially assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions <PRTPAGE P="110"/>contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.</P>
              <P>(h) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (h) is preempted as provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Types of financing.</E> A State Agency that used the Fast Track Procedures formerly in this part must provide permanent financing for any new construction or substantial rehabilitation project without Federal mortgage insurance, except coinsurance under section 244 under the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq). Obligations issued by the HFA for this purpose may be taxable under section 802 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1440) or tax-exempt under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 103), 24 CFR part 811 or other Federal Law.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD approval.</E> (1) A State Agency, prior to receiving HUD approval of its first New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation Proposal using contract authority under this part, must submit copies of the documents relating to the method of financing Section 8 projects to HUD for review. These documents shall include bond resolutions or indentures, loan agreements, regulatory agreements, notes, mortgages or deeds of trust and other related documents, if any, but does not need to include the “official statement” or copies of the prospectus for individual bond issues. HUD review will be limited to making certain that the documents are not inconsistent with or in violation of these regulations and the administrative procedures used to implement them. After review, HUD must notify the Agency that the documents are acceptable or, if unacceptable, will request clarification or changes. This review and approval will meet the requirements of 24 CFR 811.107(a).</P>
              <P>(2) When an Agency which has received HUD approval of its financing documents proposes substantive changes in them which affect the Section 8 program, the revised documents must be submitted for review. HUD review will be limited to the areas indicated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and must be carried out promptly. HUD will notify the Agency that the revised documents are acceptable, or, if unacceptable, will request clarification or changes.</P>
              <P>(3) The review and approval of financing documents required under 24 CFR part 811 will constitute HUD approval under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) The Agency must retain in its files, and make available for HUD inspection, the documentation relating to its financing of Section 8 projects, including any relating to the certifications of compliance with applicable Department of Treasury or HUD regulations (24 CFR part 811) regarding tax-exempt financing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Pledge of Contracts.</E> The HFA or owner may pledge, or offer as security for any loan or obligation, an Agreement, Contract, or ACC entered into pursuant this part provided that such security is in connection with a project constructed pursuant to this part. Any pledge of the Agreement, Contract, or ACC, or payments thereunder will be limited to the amounts payable under the Contract or ACC in accordance with its terms. If the pledge or other document provides that all payments will be paid directly to the HFA, other mortgagee or the trustee for bondholders, the HFA, other mortgagee or trustee may make all payments or deposits required under the mortgage or trust indenture and remit any excess to the owner.<PRTPAGE P="111"/>

              <P>(1) The Agreement, the Contract and the ACC will continue in effect, and</P>
              <P>(2) Housing assistance payments will continue in accordance with the terms of the Contract, unless approval to amend or terminate the Agreement, the Contract or the ACC has been obtained from the Assistant Secretary.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Certifications of projected financing terms.</E> When an HFA, under this part, provides permanent financing for a project through the issuance of obligations and these are not sold until after the contract rents for a project have been set, the HFA must submit, with the Proposal, a certification of:</P>
              <P>(1) Its projected rate of borrowing (net interest cost), based on a reasonable evaluation of market conditions, on obligations issued to provide interim and permanent financing for the project,</P>
              <P>(2) The projected cost of borrowing to the owner on interim financing for the project,</P>
              <P>(3) The projected loan amount for the project,</P>
              <P>(4) The projected cost of borrowing and the term of the permanent financing to be provided to the owner for the project,</P>
              <P>(5) The projected annual debt service for the permanent financing on which the Contract Rents are based, and</P>
              <P>(6) The override, if any.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Revised certifications.</E> If, at any time prior to the execution of the Agreement, the terms and conditions of financing change, other than the HFA's projected cost of borrowing, the HFA must submit revised certifications based upon the new terms.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Certifications of actual financing terms.</E> After a project has been permanently financed, the HFA must submit a certification which specifies the actual financing terms. The items that must be included in this certification include:</P>
              <P>(1) The HFA's actual cost of borrowing (net interest cost) on obligations from which funds were used to permanently finance the project,</P>
              <P>(2) The override, if any, added to the actual cost of borrowing on obligations in setting the rate of lending to the owner,</P>
              <P>(3) The annual debt service to the owner for the permanent financing on which contract rents are based; and,</P>
              <P>(4) The actual loan amount and the term on which the annual debt service is based.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reduction of Contract Rents.</E> If the actual debt service to the owner under the permanent financing is lower than the anticipated debt service on which the Contract Rents were based, the initial Contract Rents, or the Contract Rents currently in effect, must be reduced commensurately, and the amount of the savings credited to the project account.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Increase of Contract Rents.</E> This paragraph (e) applies only if the HFA is using its set-aside for the project and it is processed under subpart D. If the actual debt service to the owner under the permanent financing is higher than the anticipated debt service on which the Contract Rents are based, the initial Contract Rents or the Contract Rents currently in effect may, if sufficient contract and budget authority is available, be increased commensurately based on the certification submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of this increase may not exceed the amount of the Financing Cost Contingency (FCC) authorized but not reserved for the project at the time the proposal is approved. The adjustment must not exceed the amount necessary to reflect an increase in debt <PRTPAGE P="112"/>service (based on the difference between the projected and actual terms of the permanent financing) resulting from an increase over the projected interest rate of not more than:</P>
              <P>(1) One and one-half percent if the projected override was three-fourths of one percent or less, or</P>
              <P>(2) One percent if such projected override was more than three-fourths of one percent but not more than one percent, or</P>
              <P>(3) One-half of one percent if such projected override was more than one percent.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Recoupment of savings in financing costs.</E> In the event that interim financing is continued after the first year of the term of the Contract and the debt service of the interim financing for any period of three months after such first year is less than the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing on which the Contract Rents were based, an appropriate amount reflecting the savings in financing cost will be credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments payable to the owner. If during the course of the same year there is any period of three months in which the debt service is greater than the anticipated debt service under the projected permanent financing, an adjustment will be made so that only the net amount of savings in debt service for the year is credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments to the owner. No increased payments will be made to the owner on account of any net excess for the year of actual interim debt service over the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed as requiring a permanent reduction in the Contract Rents or precluding adjustments of Contract Rents in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance with other regulations.</E> The HFA must also submit a certification specifying:</P>
              <P>(1) That the terms of financing, the amount of the obligations issued with respect to the project and the use of the funds will be in compliance with any regulation governing the issuance of the obligations, e.g., Department of the Treasury regulations regarding arbitrage or HUD regulations regarding Tax Exemption of Obligations of Public Housing Agencies (24 CFR part 811), and</P>
              <P>(2) That the override, if any, on the permanent financing for the project will not be greater than the projected override nor greater than the override allowed for the borrowing as a whole under applicable regulations, e.g., the Department of Treasury regulations regarding arbitrage. The certifications required under 24 CFR 811.107(a)(2) will be sufficient to meet the certification requirements of this paragraph (g).</P>

              <FP>The housing assistance payments are made monthly by the State Agency upon proper requisition by the owner, except payments for vacancies of more than 60 days, which are made semi-annually by the Agency upon proper requisition by the owner.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount of Housing Assistance Payments to the Owner.</E> (1) The amount of the housing assistance payments made to the owner of a unit being leased by an eligible family is the difference between the contract rent for the unit and the tenant rent payable by the family.</P>

              <P>(2) A housing assistance payment will be made to the owner for a vacant assisted unit in an amount equal to 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy, subject to the conditions in § 880.611 of this chapter. If the owner collects any tenant rent or <PRTPAGE P="114"/>other amount for this period which, when added to this vacancy payment, exceeds the contract rent, the excess must be repaid as the Agency directs in accordance with HUD guidelines.</P>
              <P>(3) For a vacancy that exceeds 60 days, a housing assistance payment for the vacant unit will be made, subject to the conditions in § 880.611 of this chapter, in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of utility reimbursement.</E> Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of the Agency. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.</P>

(See § 883.606)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Project Account.</E> (1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account for housing assistance payments (and fees for Agency admininstration, if appropriate) when needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant rents and for other costs specifically approved by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required payments under the ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the 1937 Act, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the ACC will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant rents.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of the contract administrator. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the utility reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company. No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an Owner; however, cooperatives are considered rental housing, rather than Owner-occupied housing, for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Vacancies during rent-up.</E> If a Contract Unit is not leased as of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner shall be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract, in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 884.213(b): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the Owner: (1) Commenced marketing and otherwise complied with § 884.211(e), (2) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy, including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD or the PHA, as the case may be.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Vacancies after rent-up.</E> (1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days; provided, however, That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period in an amount which, when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 884.115). The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (c)(1) unless he: (i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (ii) has taken and continues to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, he shall not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that: (i) He gave such Family a written notice of the proposed eviction, stating the grounds and advising the Family that it had 10 days within which to present its objections to the Owner in writing or in person and (ii) the proposed eviction was not in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(2) Additional payments under this paragraph (d) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The unit was in decent, safe and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) and (c)(2) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner has demonstrated, in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance wih the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the owner and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of the amount needed to make up the deficiency.</P>
              <P>(iv) The owner has submitted to HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that, based on the owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.</E> The Owner shall not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section to the extent he is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act or payments under § 884.115).</P>

If, after conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines that the applicant shall not be admitted, the PHA shall so notify the applicant in writing and such notice shall inform the applicant that he has the right to request a review by HUD of the PHA's determination. The procedures of this subparagraph do not preclude the applicant from exercising his other rights if he believes he is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.

              <P>(a) The owner is responsible for termination of tenancies, including evictions. However, conditions for payment of housing assistance payments for any resulting vacancies must be as set forth in § 884.106(c)(1). Failure of the family to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, shall be grounds for termination of tenancy. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, including the applicable informal requirements, see 24 CFR part 5 and also <PRTPAGE P="130"/>for provisions concerning assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(b) Termination of tenancy for criminal activity by a covered person is subject to 24 CFR 5.858 and 5.859, and termination of tenancy for alcohol abuse by a covered person is subject to 24 CFR 5.860.</P>
              <P>(c) In actions or potential actions to terminate tenancy, the owner shall follow 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maintenance and operation.</E> The Owner shall maintain and operate the project so as to provide Decent, Safe, and Sanitary housing and he shall provide all the services, maintenance and utilities which he agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if he fails to meet these obligations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection prior to occupancy.</E> Prior to occupancy of any unit by a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit and both shall certify, on forms prescribed by HUD, that they have inspected the unit and have determined it to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary in accordance with the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these reports shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least three years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Periodic inspections.</E> HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) will inspect or cause to be inspected each Contract unit and related facilities at least annually and at such other times (including prior to initial occupancy and rerenting of any unit) as HUD (or the PHA) may determine to be necessary to assure that the Owner is meeting his obligation to maintain the units in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition and to provide the agreed upon utilities and other services. HUD (or the PHA) will take into account complaints by occupants and any other information coming to its attention in scheduling inspections and shall notify the Owner and the Family of its determination.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Units not decent, safe, and sanitary.</E> If HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) notifies the Owner that he has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition and the Owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice, HUD (or the PHA) may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments, even if the Family continues to occupy the unit. If, however, the Family wishes to be rehoused in another dwelling unit with Section 8 assistance and HUD (or the PHA) does not have other Section 8 funds for such purposes, HUD (or the PHA) may use the abated housing assistance payments for the purpose of rehousing the Family in another dwelling unit. Where this is done, the Owner shall be notified that he will be entitled to resumption of housing assistance payments for the vacated dwelling unit if:</P>
              <P>(1) The unit is restored to Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition;</P>
              <P>(2) The Family is willing to and does move back to the restored dwelling unit; and</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reexamination of family income and composition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once each year. Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination <PRTPAGE P="131"/>of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The family must comply with provisions of its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See 24 CFR 750.10(d)(2)(i) for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995 when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Continuation of housing assistance payments.</E> A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments continues until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Contract Rent plus any utility allowance, or until the family loses eligibility for continued occupancy under Farmer's Home Administration regulations. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR part 5 and also for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination ofassistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>

In the case of an overcrowded unit, if the Owner does not have any suitable units or if no vacancy of a suitable unit occurs within a reasonable time, HUD (or the PHA) will assist the Family in finding a suitable dwelling unit and require the Family to move to such a unit as soon as possible.

Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the project owner must advise the Secretary and request approval of new Utility Allowances. Whenever a Utility Allowance for a unit is adjusted, the owner will promptly notify affected families and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant rent and the amount of the housing assistance payment for the unit.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.</E> During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 884.214; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD (or the PHA in accordance with HUD guidelines and at the direction of HUD, as appropriate). If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD (or the PHA in accordance with HUD guidelines and at the direction of HUD, as appropriate). Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.</E> HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate), after consultation with the Farmers Home Administration, may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>

              <P>(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) determines that <PRTPAGE P="133"/>the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC or the Contract, as appropriate, to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;</P>
              <P>(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and</P>
              <P>(3) Contract and budget authority are available.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.</E> If an owner subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with 24 CFR part 5 because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in 24 CFR part 5, the owner shall comply with the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Election by owners of eligible projects.</E> (i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:</P>
              <P>(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or</P>
              <P>(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">HUD approval of election not required.</E> (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD <PRTPAGE P="134"/>before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evidence supporting project eligibility.</E> Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary sources.</E> Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Secondary sources.</E> Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sources in conflict.</E> If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide <E T="03">clear evidence</E> of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where sources documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:<PRTPAGE P="135"/>

              <P>(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and</P>

              <P>(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Secondary preferences.</E> An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Availability of units to families without regard to preference.</E> An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or</P>
              <P>(2) The owner has <E T="03">not</E> adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.</E> To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:</P>
              <P>(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 884.214(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prohibition of evictions.</E> An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).</P>

              <P>(a) The policies and procedures of this subpart apply to Housing Assistance Payments under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 on behalf of Eligible Families in Eligible Projects (see definitions in § 886.102).</P>
              <P>(b) The primary goal of the Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside Program is to reduce claims on the Department's insurance fund by aiding those FHA-insured or Secretary-Held projects with immediately or potentially serious financial difficulties. A first priority should be given to projects with presently serious financial problems, which are likely to result in a claim on the insurance fund in the near future. To the extent resources remain available, assistance also may be provided to projects with potentially serious financial problems which, on the basis of financial and/or management analysis, appear to have a high probability of producing a claim on the insurance fund within approximately the next five years.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Approval of applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>HUD shall approve applications, after considering all pertinent information including comments (if any) received during the comment period from the unit of general local government, based on the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(a) The Owner's Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is approvable.</P>
              <P>(b) The HUD-approved unit rents are approvable within the Fair Market Rent limitations contained in § 886.110.</P>
              <P>(c) The residential units meet the housing quality standards set forth in § 886.113, except for such variations as HUD may approve. Local climatic or geological conditions or local codes are examples which may justify such variations.</P>
              <P>(d) A significant number of residents, or potential residents, in the case of projects having a vacancy rate over 10 percent, are eligible for and in need of Section 8 assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) The infusion of Section 8 assistance into the subject project should not affect other HUD-related multifamily housing within the same neighborhood in a substantially adverse manner. Examples of such adverse effects are (1) substantial move-outs from nearby HUD-related projects precipitated by much lower rents in the subject project, or (2) substantial diversion of prospective applicants from such projects to the subject project.</P>
              <P>(f) A first priority is given to HUD-Insured or Secretary-Held projects with presently serious financial problems, which are likely to result in a claim on the insurance fund in the near future. To the extent resources remain available, assistance also may be provided to projects with potentially serious financial problems which, on the basis of financial and/or management analysis, appear to have a high probability of producing a claim on the insurance funds within approximately the next five years.</P>

              <P>(g) The infusion of Section 8 assistance into the subject project solves an identifiable problem, e.g., high vacancies and/or turnover, and provides a <PRTPAGE P="140"/>reasonable assurance of long-term project viability. A determination of long-term viability shall be based upon the following considerations:</P>
              <P>(1) The project is not subject to any serious problems that are non-economic in nature. Examples of such problems are poor location, structural deficiencies or disinterested ownership.</P>
              <P>(2) The Owner is in substantial compliance with the Regulatory Agreement. Owners are not diverting project funds for personal use. No dividends are being paid during any period of financial difficulty.</P>
              <P>(3) The management agent is in substantial compliance with the management agreement. The current management agreement has been approved by HUD. Financial records are adequately kept. Occupancy requirements are being met. Marketing and maintenance programs are being carried out in an adequate manner, based upon available financial resources.</P>
              <P>(4) The project's problems are primarily the result of factors beyond the control of the present ownership and management.</P>
              <P>(5) The major problems are traceable to an inadequate cash flow.</P>
              <P>(6) The infusion of Section 8 assistance will solve the cash flow problem by:</P>
              <P>(i) Making it possible to grant needed rent increases;</P>
              <P>(ii) Reducing turnover, vacancies and collection losses.</P>
              <P>(7) The Owner's plan for remedying any deferred maintenance, financial problems, or other problems is realistic and achievable. There is positive evidence that the Owner will carry out the plan. Examples of such evidence are the Owner's past performance in correcting problems and, in the case of profit-motivated Owners, any cash contributions made to correct project problems.</P>
              <P>(h) Any plan submitted pursuant to § 886.105(d) is found by HUD to be adequate.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Number of units assisted.</E> Based on analysis of housing assistance needs of families residing or expected to reside in the project, HUD shall determine the number of units to be assisted up to 100 percent of the units in the project. All units currently assisted under section 23 or section 8 shall be converted and included under the Contract pursuant to this subpart, unless the parties to the Lease or Contract object to such conversion. Units assisted under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 or under section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act shall not be included under the Contract pursuant to this subpart unless the Owner proposes and HUD approves such conversion.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum annual Contract commitment.</E> The maximum annual housing assistance payments that may be committed under the Contract shall be that amount which, when paid annually over the term of the Contract, is determined by HUD to be sufficient to provide for all housing assistance payments and fees under the Contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Project Account.</E> In order to assure that housing assistance payments will be increased on a timely basis to cover increases in Contract Rents or decreases in Family Incomes:</P>
              <P>(1) A Project Account shall be established and maintained, in an amount as determined by the Secretary consistent with his responsibilities under section 8(c)(6) of the Act, out of amounts by which the maximum annual Contract commitment per year exceeds amounts paid under the Contract for any year. This account shall be established and maintained by HUD for each project as a specifically identified and segregated account, and payment shall be made therefrom only for the purposes of (i) housing assistance payments, and (ii) other costs specifically authorized or approved by the Secretary.</P>

              <P>(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required housing assistance payments for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual Contract commitment, and would cause the amount in the Project Account to be less than an amount equal to 40 percent of such maximum annual Contract commitment, HUD shall, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the Act as may be necessary to carry out this assurance, including (as provided in that section of the Act) “the <PRTPAGE P="141"/>allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts.”</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.</P>
              <P>(b) No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an Owner; cooperatives are considered rental housing.</P>

              <P>(c) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period, or applies security deposits for unpaid rent, in amounts which when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 886.116.) The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he:</P>
              <P>(1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and</P>
              <P>(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list (if any), and advising them of the availability of the unit, and</P>
              <P>(3) Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause.</P>

              <P>This section applies to adjustments of the dollar amount stated in the Contract as the Maximum Unit Rent. It does not apply to adjustments in rents payable to Owners as required by HUD in connection with its mortgage insurance and/or lending functions.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Annual adjustments.</E> The contract rents may be adjusted annually, or more frequently, at HUD's option, either (1) on the basis of a written request for a rent increase submitted by the owner and properly supported by substantiating evidence, or (2) by applying, on each anniversary date of the contract, the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor most recently published by HUD in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in accordance with 24 CFR part 888, subpart B. Published Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors will be reduced appropriately by HUD where utilities are paid directly by Families. If HUD requires that the owner submit a written request, HUD, within a reasonable time, shall approve a rental <PRTPAGE P="143"/>schedule that is necessary to compensate for any increase in taxes (other than income taxes) and operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control, or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor. Increases in taxes and maintenance and operating costs shall be measured against levels of such expenses in comparable assisted and unassisted housing in the area to ensure that adjustments in the Contract Rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted rents be less than the contract rents on the effective date of the contract.</P>

Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See part 5, subpart B, of this title for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995, when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.</P>

The termination of eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with program requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure <PRTPAGE P="147"/>and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title.

For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 886.121; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.</E> HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> HUD will agree to an amendment of the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;</P>

              <P>(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and<PRTPAGE P="149"/>

              <P>(3) Contract and budget authority are available.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to Contracts executed on or after October 3, 1984.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.</E> If an owner subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with part 5, subpart E, of this title because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in part 5, subpart E, of this title, the owner shall comply with the provisions of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A “displaced person” (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), <PRTPAGE P="150"/>and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the Owner's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is found to be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the owner. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the owner's determination on such appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility of owner.</E> (1) The owner shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that he or she will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The owner is responsible for such compliance notwithstanding and third party's contractual obligation to the owner to comply with these provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of providing required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost to the same extent and in the same manner as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid for with funds available from other sources.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The owner shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) for purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
              <P>(i) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after the date of the submission of the application to HUD;</P>
              <P>(ii) Before submission of the application to HUD, if HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or</P>
              <P>(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs;</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant moves after execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract and estimated average monthly utility costs; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The total tenant payment, as determined under part 5 of this title, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income;</P>
              <P>(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
              <P>(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>

              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced <PRTPAGE P="151"/>person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
              <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>
              <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
              <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
              <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the owner's execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible Families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">No assistance for owners.</E> No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an owner. However, cooperatives are considered rental housing rather than owner-occupied housing under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payments for vacancies from execution of contract to initial occupancy.</E> If a Contract unit which is decent, safe and sanitary and has been accepted by HUD as available as of the effective date of the Contract is not leased within 15 days of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner will be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract provided that the Owner (1) has submitted a list of units leased as of the effective date and a list of the units not so leased; (2) 60 days prior to the completion of the rehabilitation or the date the agreement was executed, whichever is later, had notified the PHA of any units which the owner anticipated would be vacant on the anticipated effective date of the contract; (3) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy including, but not limited to: contracting applicants on the Owner's waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the units in a manner specifically designed to reach low-income families; and (4) has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to HUD.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payments for vacancies after initial occupancy.</E> If an eligible family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the owner may receive housing assistance payments for so <PRTPAGE P="156"/>much of the month in which the Family vacates the unit as the unit remains vacant. Should the unit remain vacant, the Owner may receive from HUD a housing assistance payment in the amount of 80 percent of Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding an additional month. However, if the owner collects any of the family's share of the rent for this period, the payment must be reduced to an amount which, when added to the family's payments, does not exceed 80 percent of the Contract Rent. Any such excess shall be reimbursed by the Owner to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 886.315.) The owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he or she: (1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (2) has made and continues to make a good faith effort to fill the vacancy, including but not limited to, contacting applicants on the waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Payments for units where family is evicted.</E> If the owner evicts a family, the owner shall not be entitled to any payments pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that the provisions of § 886.327 and part 247 of this title have been followed.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prohibition for double compensation for vacancies.</E> The owner shall not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section to the extent he or she is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act or payments under § 886.315).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Debt service payments.</E> (1) If a contract unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Owner may submit a claim and receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to such a vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether such vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.</P>
              <P>(2) Additional payments under this paragraph (g) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:</P>
              <P>(i) The unit is not in a project insured under the National Housing Act except pursuant to section 244 of that Act.</P>
              <P>(ii) The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.</P>
              <P>(iii) The owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(iv) The Owner has demonstrated in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance with the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the Owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the Owner, and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of that portion of the deficiency which is attributable to the vacant units for the period of the vacancies.</P>
              <P>(v) The Owner has submitted, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.</P>

              <P>(3) HUD may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that based on the Owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can <PRTPAGE P="157"/>achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</P>

Service shall not be considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished.

Increases in taxes and maintenance and operating costs shall be measured against levels of such expenses in comparable assisted and unassisted housing in the area to ensure that adjustments in the contract rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Amount of deposits.</E> If at the time of the initial execution of the Lease the Owner wishes to collect a security deposit, the maximum amount shall be the greater of one month's Gross Family Contribution or $50. However, this amount shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under State or local law. For units leased in place, security deposits collected prior to the execution of a Contract which are in excess of this maximum amount do not have to be refunded until the Family is expected to pay security deposits and utility deposits from its resources and/or other public or private sources.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When a Family vacates.</E> If a Family vacates the unit, the Owner, subject to State and local law, may use the security deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid Family Contribution or other amount which the Family owes under the Lease. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease consistent with State or local law or if such amount is less than the amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused balance to the Family.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interest payable on deposits.</E> In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of interest payable. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security deposits.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Insufficient deposits.</E> If the security deposit is insufficient to reimburse the Owner for the unpaid Family Contribution or other amounts which the Family owes under the Lease, or if the Owner did not collect a security deposit, the Owner may claim reimbursement from HUD for an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1) The amount owed the Owner, (2) two months' Contract Rent, minus, in either case, the greater of the security deposit actually collected or the amount of security deposit the owner could have collected under the program (pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section). Any reimbursement under this section must be applied first toward any unpaid Family Contribution due under the Lease and then to any other amounts owed. No reimbursement shall be claimed for unpaid rent for the period after the family vacates.</P>

When contract termination is under consideration by HUD, HUD shall give eligible families an opportunity to submit written and other comments.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketing in accordance with HUD-Approved Plan.</E> Marketing of units and selection of families by the owner shall be in accordance with the owner's HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, HUD-approved tenant selection factors and with all regulations relating to fair housing advertising including use of the equal opportunity logotype, statement, and slogan in all advertising. Projects shall be managed and operated without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) HUD will determine the eligibility of assistance of families in occupancy before sales closing. After the sale, the owner shall be responsible for taking applications, selecting families, and all related determinations, in accordance with part 5 of this title. (See especially, 24 CFR part 5, subpart F).</P>
              <P>(2) For every family that applies for admission, the owner and the applicant must complete and sign the form of application prescribed by HUD. When the owner decides no longer to accept applications, the owner must publish a notice to that effect in a publication likely to be read by potential applicants. The notice must state the reasons for the owner's refusal to accept additional applications. When the owner agrees to accept applications again, a notice to this effect must also be published. The owner must retain copies of all completed applications together with any related correspondence for three years. For each family selected for admission, the owner must submit one copy of the completed and signed application to HUD. Housing assistance payments will not be made on behalf of an admitted family until after this copy has been received by HUD.</P>
              <P>(3) If the owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable but the owner does not have a suitable unit to offer, the owner shall place such family on the waiting list and so advise the family indicating approximately when a unit may be available.</P>
              <P>(4) If the owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable in accordance with the HUD approved tenant selection factors and if the owner has a suitable unit, the owner and the family shall enter into a lease. The lease shall be on a form approved by HUD and shall otherwise be in conformity with the provisions of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(5) Records on applicant families and approved families shall be maintained by the owner so as to provide HUD with racial, ethnic, and gender data and shall be retained by the owner for 3 years.</P>
              <P>(6) If the owner determines that an applicant is not eligible, or, if eligible, not selected, the owner must notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons upon which the determination is made, and inform the applicant that the applicant has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing if the applicant believes that the owner's determination is based on erroneous information. The procedures of this paragraph (b)(6) do not preclude an applicant from exercising his or her other rights if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. The owner must retain for three years a copy of the application, the letter, the applicant's response, if any, the record of any informal hearing, and a statement of final disposition. The informal review provisions for the denial of a tenant selection preference under § 886.337 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section.</P>

              <P>(7) For the informal hearing provisions related to denial of assistance based upon failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5 of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed <PRTPAGE P="162"/>families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of denial of assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial occupancy.</E> (1) Where rehabilitation is involved, sixty days prior to the completion of the rehabilitation, or when the rehabilitation is begun, whichever is later, the Owner shall determine whether the tenant population of the project generally reflects the racial/ethnic makeup of the housing market area. Based on this determination, the Owner shall then conduct appropriate marketing activities in accordance with a HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan. Such activities may include special outreach to those groups identified as not ordinarily expected to apply for these units without special outreach; notification to PHA's in the housing market area of any anticipated vacancies; and formulation of waiting lists based on the Owner's HUD-approved tenant selection factors.</P>
              <P>(2) Where a PHA is notified, the PHA shall notify an appropriate size family (families) on its waiting list of the availability of the unit and refer the family (families) to the owner. (Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection, the owner is not required to lease to a PHA selected family, but the owner must comply with § 886.321(b)(6).)</P>

Failure to do so shall be considered a material default under the contract and Regulatory Agreement, if any.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Reexamination of family income and composition.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once each year. Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust <PRTPAGE P="163"/>Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See part 5, subpart B, of this title for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995 when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Continuation of housing assistance payments.</E> A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments will continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Contact Rent plus any applicable Utility Allowance. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5, subpart E, of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.</P>

The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and concerning deferral of termination of assistance, also shall apply.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Leasing to eligible families.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.</E> During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 886.321; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.</E> HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> HUD will agree to an amendment of the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;</P>
              <P>(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and</P>
              <P>(3) Contract and budget authority are available.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts involving substantial rehabilitation. These paragraphs apply to all other Contracts executed on or after October, 3, 1984. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the Borrower must make the unit available for occupancy <PRTPAGE P="166"/>by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.</E> If an owner who is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with part 5, subpart E, of this title because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in part 5, subpart E, of this title, the owner shall comply with the provisions of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.</P>
              <P>(f) The regulations of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preferences for occupancy by elderly families.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Election by owners of eligible projects.</E> (i) An owner of a project involving substantial rehabilitation and assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.</P>
              <P>(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:</P>
              <P>(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or</P>
              <P>(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">HUD approval of election not required.</E> (i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 <PRTPAGE P="167"/>U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evidence supporting project eligibility.</E> Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i), or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Primary sources.</E> Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Secondary sources.</E> Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Sources in conflict.</E> If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide <E T="03">clear evidence</E> of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of—</P>
              <P>(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and</P>

              <P>(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992; <E T="03">or</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.</E> The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families <PRTPAGE P="168"/>will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Secondary preferences.</E> An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.</E> If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Availability of units to families without regard to preference.</E> An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:</P>
              <P>(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or</P>
              <P>(2) The owner has <E T="03">not</E> adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.</E> To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:</P>
              <P>(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 886.321(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and</P>
              <P>(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Prohibition of evictions.</E> An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Time of execution.</E> Upon acceptance of the unit(s) by HUD pursuant to § 886.333(f), the contract will be executed first by the Owner and then by HUD. The effective date must be no earlier than the HUD inspection which provides the basis for unconditional acceptance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes in initial contract rents during rehabilitation.</E> (1) The Contract Rents established pursuant to § 886.310 and 24 CFR part 290 will be the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract except under the following circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) When, during rehabilitation, work items are discovered which could not reasonably have been anticipated by HUD or are necessitated by an unforeseen change in local codes or ordinances; were not listed in the work write-up prepared by HUD but are deemed by HUD, in writing, to be necessary work; and will require additional expenditures which would make the rehabilitations infeasible at the Contract Rents established in the Agreement. Under these circumstances, HUD will:</P>
              <P>(A) Approve a change order to the rehabilitation contract, or amend the work write-up if there is no rehabilitation contract, specifying the additional work to be accomplished and the additional cost for this work,</P>
              <P>(B) Recompute the Contract Rents, within the limits specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, based upon the revised cost estimate, and</P>
              <P>(C) Prepare and execute an amendment to the Agreement stating the additional work required and the revised Contract Rents.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the actual cost of the rehabilitation performed is less than that estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement.</P>
              <P>(iii) When, due to unforeseen factors, the actual certified relocation payments made by the Owner to temporarily relocated Families varies from the cost estimated by HUD.</P>
              <P>(2) Should changes occur as specified in paragraph (b)(1) (ii) or (iii) (either an increase or decrease), HUD may recalculate the Contract Rents and amend the Contract or Agreement, as appropriate, to reflect the revised rents. The rents shall not be recalculated based on increased costs to maintain rents at the Section 8 level during the rehabilitation period.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD must review and approve the Owner's certification that the rehabilitation costs and relocation costs are the actual costs incurred.</P>
              <P>(4) In establishing the revised Contract Rents, HUD must determine that the resulting Contract Rents plus an applicable Utility Allowances do not exceed the Fair Market Rent or the exception rent provided in § 886.310 in effect at the time of execution of the Agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Unleased unit(s).</E> At the time the contract is executed, HUD will provide a list of dwelling unit(s) leased as of the effective date of the Contract and a list of the unit(s) not so leased, if any, and shall determine whether or not the owner has met the obligations with respect to any unleased unit(s) and for which of those unit(s) vacancy payments will be made by HUD. The owner <PRTPAGE P="172"/>must indicate in writing either concurrence with this determination or disagreement reserving all rights to claim vacancy payments for the unleased unit(s) pursuant to the contract, without prejudice by reason of the owner's signing the contract.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</P>
              <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs; and</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the rehabilitation; and</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A “displaced person” (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Real property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the owner's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is found to be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination <PRTPAGE P="173"/>with the owner. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the owner's determination on such appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility of owner.</E> (1) The owner shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that he or she will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The owner is responsible for such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the owner to comply with these provisions.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of providing required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost to the same extent and in the same manner as other project costs. Such costs may also be paid for with funds available from other sources.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The owner shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
              <P>(i) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after the date of the submission of the application to HUD;</P>
              <P>(ii) Before submission of the application to HUD, if HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or</P>
              <P>(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant moves after the execution of the contract to provide Housing Assistance Payments, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract and estimated average monthly utility costs; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The total tenant payment, as determined under part 5 of this title, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or</P>
              <P>(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
              <P>(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
              <P>(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;</P>

              <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as <PRTPAGE P="174"/>a “displaced person” (or for assistance under this section) as a result of the project;</P>
              <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
              <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the owner's execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fair market rents for existing housing: Applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The fair market rents (FMRs) for existing housing are determined by HUD and are used in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (HCV program) (part 982 of this title), Section 8 project-based assistance programs and other programs requiring their use. In the HCV program, the FMRs are used to determine payment standard schedules. In the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, the FMRs are used to determine the maximum initial rent (at the beginning of the term of a housing assistance payments contract).</P>
              <P>(b) Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities (except telephone), as established by HUD, pursuant to this subpart, for units of varying sizes (by number of bedrooms), that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe and sanitary rental housing of modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fair market rents for existing housing: Methodology.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basis for setting fair market rents.</E> Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are estimates of rent plus the cost of utilities, except telephone. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates of rents that provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution of standard quality rental housing units in the FMR area. FMRs are set at the 40th percentile rent, the dollar amount below which the rent for 40 percent of standard quality rental housing units fall within the FMR area. The 40th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units within the FMR area that are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built units and substandard units.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Setting FMRs at the 40th percentile rent.</E> Generally, HUD will set the FMRs at the 40th percentile rent, but no lower than 90 percent of the previous year's FMR for the FMR area.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Setting Small Area FMRs.</E> (1) HUD will set Small Area FMRs for certain metropolitan FMR areas for use in the administration of tenant-based assistance under the HCV program. HUD will establish the selection values used to determine those metropolitan areas <PRTPAGE P="176"/>through a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice on November 16, 2016 and may update the selection values through a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice, subject to public comment. The selection criteria used to determine those metropolitan areas are:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of vouchers under lease in the metropolitan FMR area;</P>
              <P>(ii) The percentage of the standard quality rental stock, within the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR area;</P>
              <P>(iii) The percentage of voucher families living in concentrated low income areas;</P>
              <P>(iv) The percentage of voucher families living in concentrated low income areas relative to the percentage of all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan area; and</P>
              <P>(v) The vacancy rate for the metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of determining applicability of Small Area FMRs to a metropolitan area, the term “concentrated low-income areas” means:</P>
              <P>(i) Those census tracts in the metropolitan FMR area with a poverty rate of 25 percent or more; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Any tract in the metropolitan FMR area where at least 50 percent of the households earn less than 60 percent of the area median income and are designated by HUD as Qualified Census Tracts in accordance with section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 42).</P>
              <P>(3) If a metropolitan area meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Small Area FMRs will apply to the metropolitan area and all PHAs administering HCV programs in that area will be required to use Small Area FMRs. A PHA administering an HCV program in a metropolitan area not subject to the application of Small Area FMRs may opt to use Small Area FMRs by seeking approval from HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) through written request to PIH.</P>
              <P>(4) HUD will designate Small Area FMR areas at the beginning of a Federal fiscal year, such designations will be permanent, and will make new area designations every 5 years thereafter as new data becomes available. HUD may suspend a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan area, or may temporarily exempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area from use of the Small Area FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination that such action is warranted. Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs are:</P>
              <P>(i) A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing units;</P>
              <P>(ii) A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Other events as determined by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(5) Small Area FMRs only apply to tenant-based assistance under the HCV program. However, a PHA may elect to apply Small Area FMRs to project-based voucher (PBV) units at 24 CFR part 983 as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">FMR areas.</E> FMR areas comprise metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties and Small Area FMR areas as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Generally, FMR areas are metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties. With several exceptions, the most current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metropolitan area definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) are used because of their generally close correspondence with housing market area definitions. HUD may make exceptions to OMB definitions if the MSAs encompass areas that are larger than housing market areas. The counties deleted from the HUD-defined FMR areas in those cases are established as separate metropolitan county FMR areas. FMRs are established for all areas in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Insular Areas of the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) Small Area FMR areas are the U.S. Postal Service ZIP code areas within a designated metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Data sources.</E> (1) HUD uses the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates and may add other data sources as they are discovered and determined to be statistically valid. The following sources of survey data are used to develop the base-year FMR estimates:<PRTPAGE P="177"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) The most recent American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides statistically reliable rent data.</P>
              <P>(ii) Locally collected survey data acquired through Address-Based Mail surveys or Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone survey data, based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select statistically random samples of rental housing.</P>
              <P>(iii) Statistically valid information, as determined by HUD, presented to HUD during the public comment and review period.</P>
              <P>(2) Base-year recent mover adjusted FMRs are updated and trended to the midpoint of the program year they are to be effective using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents and for utilities.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Unit size adjustments.</E> (1) For most areas the ratios developed incorporating the most recent American Community Survey data are applied to the two-bedroom FMR estimates to derive FMRs for other bedroom sizes. Exceptions to this procedure may be made for areas with local bedroom intervals below an acceptable range. To help the largest most difficult-to-house families find units, higher ratios than the actual market ratios may be used for three-bedroom and larger-size units.</P>
              <P>(2) The FMR for single room occupancy housing is 75 percent of the FMR for a zero bedroom unit.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Manufactured home space rental.</E> The FMR for a manufactured home space rental (for the HCV program under 24 CFR part 982) is 40 percent of the FMR for a two-bedroom unit for the metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county, as applicable. Small Area FMRs under paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to manufactured home space rentals.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Small Area FMRs and Project-based vouchers.</E> Small Area FMRs do not apply to Project-based vouchers regardless of whether HUD designates the metropolitan area or approves the PHA for Small Area FMRs under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The following exceptions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Where the PHA notice of owner selection under 24 CFR 983.51(d) was made on or before the effective dates of both the Small Area FMR designation and the PHA administrative policy, the PHA and owner may mutually agree to apply the Small Area FMR. The application of the Small Area FMRs must be prospective and consistent with the PHA administrative plan. The owner and PHA may not subsequently choose to revert back to the use of the metropolitan-wide FMRs for the PBV project. If the rent to owner will increase as a result of the mutual agreement to apply the Small Area FMRs to the PBV project, the rent increase shall not be effective until the first annual anniversary of the HAP contract in accordance with 24 CFR 983.302(b).</P>
              <P>(2) Where the PHA notice of owner selection under 24 CFR 983.51(d) was made after the effective dates of both the Small Area FMR designation and the PHA administrative policy, the Small Area FMRs shall apply to the PBV project if the PHA administrative plan provides that Small Area FMRs are used for all future PBV projects. If the PHA chooses to implement this administrative policy, the policy must apply to all future PBV projects and the PHA's entire jurisdiction. An owner and the PHA may not subsequently choose to apply the metropolitan area FMR to the project, regardless of whether the PHA subsequently changes its administrative plan to revert to the use of metropolitan-wide FMR for future PBV projects.</P>
              <P>(3) For purposes of this section, the term “effective date of the Small Area FMR designation” means:</P>
              <P>(i) The date that HUD designated a metropolitan area as a Small Area FMR area; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The date that HUD approved a PHA request to voluntarily opt to use Small Area FMRs for its HCV program, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) For purposes of this section, the term “effective date of the PHA administrative policy” means the date the administrative policy was formally adopted as part of the PHA administrative plan by the PHA Board of Commissioners or other authorized PHA officials in accordance with § 982.54(a).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Transition of metropolitan areas previously subject to 50th percentile FMRs.</E> (1) A metropolitan area designated as 50th percentile FMR areas for which <PRTPAGE P="178"/>the 3-year period has not expired prior to January 17, 2017 shall transition out of 50th percentile FMRs as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) A 50th percentile FMR area that is designated for Small Area FMRs in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section will transition to the Small Area FMRs upon the effective date of the Small Area FMR designation;</P>
              <P>(ii) A 50th percentile metropolitan FMR area not designated as a Small Area FMRs in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will remain a 50th percentile FMR until the expiration of the three-year period, at which time the metropolitan area will revert to the standard FMR based on the 40th percentile rent for the metropolitan area.</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA with jurisdiction in a 50th percentile FMR area that reverts to the standard 40th percentile FMR may request HUD approval of payment standard amounts based on the 50th percentile rent in accordance with 24 CFR 982.503(f).</P>
              <P>(3) HUD will calculate the 50th percentile rents for certain metropolitan areas for purposes of this transition and to approve success rate payment standard amounts in accordance with 24 CFR 982.503(e). As is the case for determining 40th percentile rent, the 50th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units that are occupied by recent movers and adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built units and substandard units.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and for one-time Contract Rent determinations for such eligible project owners.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart applies to all project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts under New Construction (Part 880); Substantial Rehabilitation (Part 881); State Finance Agencies (Part 883); and Section 515 Farmers Home Administration (Part 884). It also applies to those projects under Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped (Part 885) and Special Allocations (Part 886, Subparts A and C) whose Contract Rents are adjusted by use of the Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs), as described in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible project owners.</E> Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991:</P>

              <P>(1) The use of a comparability study by HUD (or the Contract Administrator), which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, <PRTPAGE P="180"/>resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or</P>
              <P>(2) The HAP contract required a project owner to request annual rent adjustments, and the project owner certifies that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Amount of the retroactive Housing Assistance Payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recalculating the total rent adjustment.</E> To establish the amount of the retroactive HAP payment for which a project owner meeting the criteria in § 888.301(c) is eligible, the total rent adjustment will be recalculated for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991. For purposes of establishing the amount of the retroactive payment only, the total rent adjustment will be an amount equal to the Contract Rent, minus the amount of the Contract Rent attributable to debt service, multiplied by the applicable AAF, for each year.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculating the retroactive payment.</E> HUD (or the Contract Administrator) will pay, as a retroactive Housing Assistance Payment, the amount, if any, by which the total rent adjustment, calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, exceeds the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period, except that in no event will any payment be an amount less than 30 percent of the aggregate of the full Contract Rent multiplied by the applicable AAF, minus the sum of the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period, adjusted by the average occupancy rate.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Occupancy rates.</E> (1) Retroactive payments will be made only for units that were occupied, based on average occupancy rate, including units qualifying for vacancy payments under 24 CFR 880.611, 881.611, 883.712, 884.106, 885.985, 886.109, or 886.309, during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991.</P>
              <P>(2) When requesting retroactive payment, a project owner must, if the information is available, submit documentation of occupancy rates, on either an annual or monthly basis, for the same time period. The average occupancy rate will be based on these records. If records are unavailable for the full time period, HUD (or the Contract Administrator) will establish an average occupancy rate, to be used for the entire period, from the occupancy rate for the three years immediately preceding May 31, 1991.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Revised AAFs.</E> For any year during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, where a HUD field office published a revised Annual Adjustment Factor that replaced the applicable AAF for a specific locality under 24 CFR 888.204, the revised Annual Adjustment Factor, which applied to all projects in that area, will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustment under paragraph (a) of this section, and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special adjustments.</E> When calculating the total rent adjustments and establishing the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any special adjustments granted under 24 CFR 880.609(b), 881,609(b), 883.710(b), 884.109(c), 886.112(c), or 886.312(c) during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, to reflect substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, utilities not covered by regulated rates, or for special adjustments for any other purpose authorized by a waiver of the regulations, will be deducted from the Contract Rent before applying the AAF.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">AAFs less than 1.0.</E> For any area where an AAF of less than 1.0 was published, a factor of 1.0 will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustments and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Debt service.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, debt service includes principal, interest, and the mortgage insurance premium, if any.</P>

              <P>(2) The monthly debt service set forth in the original mortgage documents for a project will be used to compute the debt service portion of the contract rent. The debt service will be <PRTPAGE P="181"/>compared to the spread of unit sizes included in the original HAP contract, and the amount used in the calculation will be based on the percentage of total rent potential of the various unit types.</P>
              <P>(3) If, in some cases, HUD or the Contract Administrator cannot determine the debt service for a project, the project owner will be asked to provide documentation of the debt service. The project owner will be notified by the HUD Field Office or the Contract Administrator of the need for documentation of the debt service, and allowed 30 days to respond, or for such longer period as approved by HUD or the Contract Administrator on a case-by-case basis. Where the debt service is not available to HUD or the Contract Administrator and the owner is unable to provide the necessary information, retroactive payments cannot be made.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Applicable AAF.</E> The applicable AAF is the factor in effect on the anniversary date of the contract and appropriate for the area, for the size of the unit, and for the treatment of utilities; except where, for any year when AAFs were published after November 8 and made retroactive to November 8, a project owner was given the option to choose the factor in effect on the anniversary date or the retroactive factor, the applicable AAF is the factor chosen by the project owner in that year.</P>

Eligible project owners must make a request for payment and a request for a one-time contract determination within 60 days from the date of the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for payment.</E> (1) Owners eligible for retroactive payments under § 888.301(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in § 888.301 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979, to May 31, 1991, if available.</P>
              <P>(2) Owners whose HAP contract requires a request to be made for annual rent adjustments must certify that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction in the Contract Rents as a result of a comparability study. The certification must contain the year or years upon which the request for payment is based and a statement of the basis for the belief that rents would have been reduced.</P>

              <P>(3) Retroactive payments will be made to owners over a three-year period as funds are appropriated for that purpose. When funds are available for payment, HUD will publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice containing procedures for claiming payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for one-time contract rent determination.</E> When making a request for payment, eligible owners may also request a one-time contract rent determination, as described in § 888.320. Eligible owners may request a one-time contract rent determination even if they choose not to request retroactive payments, provided they are eligible for retroactive payments.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer of ownership since October 1, 1979.</E> Eligible owners who request retroactive payments must certify that they are entitled to the entire amount of the payment. Any owner who is unable to certify must present documentation of an agreement between the current and former owners of the proportionate share of the payment for which each is eligible.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Determining the amount of the new Contract Rent.</E> Project owners eligible for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.301(c), may request a one-time Contract Rent determination, to be effective as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The request for a one-time rent determination must be made when submitting a request for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.315. If no claim for retroactive payments is made, an owner may submit only the request for a one-time rent determination, provided the owner is eligible for retroactive payments. The new Contract Rent under this provision will be the greater of:</P>
              <P>(1) The Contract Rent currently approved by HUD (or the Contract Administrator); or</P>
              <P>(2) An amount equal to the applicable AAF multipled by the Contract Rent minus debt service, calculated for each year from October 1, 1979, to May 31, 1991.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Currently approved rent.</E> The Contract Rent currently approved by HUD (or the Contract Administrator) is the Contract Rent stated in the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract signed by both HUD (or the Contract Administrator) and the owner, or as shown on HUD Form 92458 (Rental Schedule) if the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract cannot be located.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effective date of new Contract Rent.</E> The new Contract Rent, determined under paragraph (a) of this section, will be effective on May 31, 1991.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and a one-time Contract Rent determination for such eligible project owners.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart applies to all Moderate Rehabilitation projects under 24 CFR part 882, subparts D, E, and H.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible project owners.</E> Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of a comparability study by the Public Housing Agency (PHA) as contract administrator, which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or</P>
              <P>(2) The project owner certifies that a request for an annual rent adjustment was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 888.405</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Amount of the retroactive Housing Assistance Payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Recalculating the total rent adjustment.</E> To establish the amount of the retroactive HAP payment for which a project owner meeting the criteria in § 888.401(c) is eligible, the total rent adjustment will be recalculated for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991. Rents for that period will be recalculated, under the procedures set out in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), by applying the AAF for any affected year, and recalculating the rents for the remainder of the period as necessary. For each year thereafter, all rent adjustments made at the request of the owner at the time will be recalculated, under the procedures in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), to account for the new adjustments.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Calculating the retroactive payment.</E> HUD will pay, through the PHA, as a retroactive Housing Assistance Payment the amount, if any, by which the total rent adjustment, calculated under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Occupancy rate.</E> (1) Retroactive payments will be made only for units that were occupied, based on average occupancy rate, including units qualifying for vacancy payments under 24 CFR 882.411, during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991.</P>
              <P>(2) When requesting a retroactive payment, a project owner must, if the information is available, submit documentation of occupancy rates, on either an annual or monthly basis, for the same time period. The average occupancy rate will be based on these records. If records are unavailable for the full time period, the PHA will establish an average occupancy rate, to be used for the entire period, from the occupancy rate for the three years immediately preceding May 31, 1991.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Revised AAFs.</E> For any year during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, where a HUD field office published a revised Annual Adjustment Factor that replaced the applicable AAF for a specific locality under 24 CFR 888.204, the revised Annual Adjustment Factor, which applied to all projects in that area, will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustment under paragraph (a) of this section, and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Special adjustments.</E> When calculating the total rent adjustments and establishing the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any special adjustments granted under 24 CFR 882.410(a)(2) during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, to reflect substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, utilities not covered by regulated rates, or for special adjustments for any other purpose authorized by a waiver of the regulations, will be deducted from the base rent before applying the AAF.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">AAFs less than 1.0.</E> For any area where an AAF of less than 1.0 was published, a factor of 1.0 will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustments and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice of eligibility requirements for retroactive payments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of eligibility requirements.</E> PHAs will give written notice to all current owners of projects, for which they are the Contract Administrators, of the eligibility requirements for retroactive payments. Eligible project owners must make a request for payment or a request for a one-time contract determination within 60 days from the date of the notice.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Request for payment.</E> (1) Owners eligible for retroactive payments under § 888.401(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in § 888.401 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, if available.</P>

              <P>(2) Owners claiming eligibility under § 888.401(c)(2) must certify that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction in the Contract Rents as a result of a comparability study. The certification must contain <PRTPAGE P="184"/>the year or years upon which the request for payment is based and a statement of the basis for the belief that rents would have been reduced.</P>

              <P>(3) Retroactive payments will be made to owners over a three-year period as funds are appropriated for that purpose. When funds are available for payment, HUD will publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> Notice containing procedures for claiming payments.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Request for one-time contract rent determination.</E> When making a request for payment, eligible owners may also request a one-time contract rent determination, as described in § 888.420. Eligible owners may request a one-time contract rent determination even if they choose to forgo receiving retroactive payments, provided they are eligible for retroactive payments.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer of ownership since October 1, 1979.</E> Eligible owners requesting retroactive payments must certify that they are entitled to the entire amount of the payment. Any owner who is unable to certify must present documentation of an agreement between the current and former owners of the proportionate share of the payment for which each is eligible.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Review of initial rents.</E> Before calculating the amount of any retroactive payment, the PHA, if directed by HUD, will review whether rents were excessive when initially set.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Physical condition of projects.</E> If the most recent physical inspection report by the PHA shows significant deficiencies that have not been addressed to the satisfaction of the PHA by the date the retroactive payment is deposited into the project account, the payment will not be made available until the deficiencies are resolved or a plan for their resolution has been approved by the PHA.</P>

Section 202 projects shall provide a range of services that are tailored to the needs of the residents. Owners of Section 811 projects shall ensure that the residents are provided with any necessary supportive services that address their individual needs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General policy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Supportive Housing for the Elderly.</E> A capital advance and contract for project rental assistance provided under this program shall be used for the purposes described in Section 202 (12 U.S.C. 1701q(b)).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities.</E> A capital advance and contract for project rental assistance provided under this program shall be used for the purposes described in Section 811 (42 U.S.C. 8013(b)).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of capital advance funds.</E> No part of the funds reserved may be transferred by the Sponsor, except to the Owner caused to be formed by the Sponsor. This action must be accomplished prior to issuance of a commitment for capital advance funding.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Amendments.</E> Subject to the availability of funds, HUD may amend the amount of an approved capital advance only after initial closing has occurred.</P>

                <E T="03">Affiliated entities</E> means entities that the field office determines to be related to each other in such a manner that it is appropriate to treat them as a single entity.

In the case of an individual residing in an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled that is assisted under title XIX of the Social Security Act and this part, the annual income of the individual shall exclude protected <PRTPAGE P="187"/>personal income as provided under that Act.

For the Loans for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program, see § 891.505.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Low-income families</E> shall have the same meaning provided in section 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a).</P>

Rehabilitation may also include renovation, alteration, or remodeling for the conversion or adaptation of structurally sound property to the design and condition required for use under this part, or the repair or replacement of major building systems or components in danger of failure. Improvement of an existing structure requires 15 percent or more of the estimated development cost to <PRTPAGE P="188"/>rehabilitate the project for a useful life of 40 years. The useful life period commences upon execution of a capital advance agreement.</P>
              <P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Tenant payment to Owner</E> equals total tenant payment less utility allowance, if any.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Project design and cost standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In addition to the special project standards described in §§ 891.210 and 891.310, as applicable, the following standards apply:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Property standards.</E> Projects under this part must comply with HUD Minimum Property Standards as set forth in 24 CFR part 200, subpart S.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Accessibility requirements.</E> Projects under this part must comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (See 24 CFR 40.7 for availability), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's implementing regulations (24 CFR part 8), and for new construction multifamily housing projects, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100. For the Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, see additional accessibility requirements in § 891.310(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Restrictions on amenities.</E> Projects must be modest in design. Amenities not eligible for HUD funding include atriums, bowling alleys, swimming pools, saunas, and jacuzzis. Sponsors may include certain excess amenities, but they must pay for them from sources other than the Section 202 or 811 capital advance. They must also <PRTPAGE P="189"/>pay for the continuing operating costs associated with any excess amenities from sources other than the Section 202 or 811 project rental assistance contract.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Smoke detectors.</E> Smoke detectors and alarm devices must be installed in accordance with standards and criteria acceptable to HUD for the protection of occupants in any dwelling or facility bedroom or other primary sleeping area.</P>
              <P>(e) Projects under this part may have on their sites commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and of the community in which the project is located, so long as the commercial facilities are not subsidized with funding under the supportive housing programs for the elderly or persons with disabilities. Such commercial facilities are considered public accommodations under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and must be accessible under the requirements of that Act.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Broadband infrastructure.</E> Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined by 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:</P>
              <P>(1) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or</P>
              <P>(3) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.</P>

              <P>All sites must meet the following site and neighborhood requirements:</P>
              <P>(a) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities (water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets must be available to service the site.</P>
              <P>(b) The site and neighborhood must be suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527, 3 CFR, 1958-1963 Comp., p. 652); as amended by Executive Order 12259, (46 FR 1253, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 307)); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and implementing HUD regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) New construction sites must meet the following site and neighborhood requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) The site must not be located in an area of minority concentration (or minority elderly concentration under the Section 202 Program) except as permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and must not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to nonminority residents (or minority elderly to nonminority elderly residents, under the Section 202 Program) in the area.</P>
              <P>(2) A project may be located in an area of minority concentration (or minority elderly concentration, under the Section 202 Program) only if:</P>
              <P>(i) Sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority elderly households or minority disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), in the income range to be served by the proposed project, outside areas of minority concentration (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for further guidance on this criterion); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot be met in that housing market area (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for further guidance on this criterion).</P>
              <P>(3)(i) <E T="03">Sufficient</E> does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and <PRTPAGE P="190"/>outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year which over a period of several years will approach an appropriate balance of housing opportunities within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for very low-income minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or low-income minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.</P>
              <P>(ii) Units may be considered to be <E T="03">comparable opportunities</E> if they have the same household type (elderly or disabled, as applicable) and tenure type (owner/renter); require approximately the same total tenant payment; serve the same income group; are located in the same housing market; and are in standard condition.</P>
              <P>(iii) Application of this sufficient, comparable opportunities standard involves assessing the overall impact of HUD-assisted housing on the availability of housing choices for very low-income minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or low-income minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), in and outside areas of minority concentration, and must take into account the extent to which the following factors are present, along with any other factor relevant to housing choice:</P>
              <P>(A) A significant number of assisted housing units are available outside areas of minority concentration.</P>
              <P>(B) There is significant integration of assisted housing projects constructed or rehabilitated in the past ten years, relative to the racial mix of the eligible population.</P>
              <P>(C) There are racially integrated neighborhoods in the locality.</P>
              <P>(D) Programs are operated by the locality to assist minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), that wish to find housing outside areas of minority concentration.</P>
              <P>(E) Minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), have benefitted from local activities (e.g., acquisition and write-down of sites, tax relief programs for homeowners, acquisitions of units for use as assisted housing units) undertaken to expand choice for minority households (or families) outside of areas of minority concentration.</P>
              <P>(F) A significant proportion of minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority households, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), have been successful in finding units in nonminority areas under the Section 8 Certificate and Housing Voucher programs.</P>
              <P>(G) Comparable housing opportunities have been made available outside areas of minority concentration through other programs.</P>
              <P>(4) Application of the <E T="03">overriding housing needs</E> criterion, for example, permits approval of sites that are an integral part of an overall local strategy for the preservation or restoration of the immediate neighborhood and of sites in a neighborhood experiencing significant private investment that is demonstrably changing the economic character of the area (a “revitalizing area”). An <E T="03">overriding housing need,</E> however, may not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable if the only reason the need cannot otherwise be feasibly met is that discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, or national origin renders sites outside areas of minority concentration unavailable, or if the use of this standard in recent years has had the effect of circumventing the obligation to provide housing choice.</P>
              <P>(d) The neighborhood must not be one that is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other undesirable conditions predominate, unless there is actively in progress a concerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions.</P>

              <P>(e) The housing must be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services, and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods <PRTPAGE P="191"/>consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.</P>
              <P>(f) For the Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, the additional site and neighborhood requirements in § 891.320 apply.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Conflicts of interest.</E> (1) Officers and Board members of either the Sponsor or the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) may not have any financial interest in any contract with the Owner or in any firm which has a contract with the Owner. This restriction applies so long as the individual is serving on the Board and for a period of three years following resignation or final closing, whichever occurs later.</P>
              <P>(2) The following contracts between the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) and the Sponsor or the Sponsor's nonprofit affiliate will not constitute a conflict of interest if no more than two persons salaried by the Sponsor or management affiliate serve as nonvoting directors on the Owner's board of directors:</P>
              <P>(i) Management contracts (including associated management fees);</P>

              <P>The Department finds that it is necessary and desirable to assist project owners to preserve the continued viability of each project assisted under this part (except subpart E) as a housing resource for very low-income elderly persons or persons with disabilities.

Part 246 of this title applies to projects covered by subpart E of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of owner.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketing.</E> (1) The Owner must commence and continue diligent marketing activities not later than 90 days <PRTPAGE P="199"/>before the anticipated date of availability of the first unit or occupancy of the group home. Market activities shall include the provision of notices of the availability of housing under the program to operators of temporary housing for the homeless in the same housing market.</P>
              <P>(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with a HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan and all Federal, State or local fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the plan and requirements is to achieve a condition in which eligible households of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of discriminatory considerations such as their race, color, creed, religion, familial status, disability, sex or national origin.</P>
              <P>(3) At the time of PRAC execution, the Owner must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units (or in the case of a group home, leased and unleased residential spaces) with a justification for the unleased units or residential spaces, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units or residential spaces.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Management and maintenance.</E> The Owner is responsible for all management functions. These functions include selection and admission of tenants, required reexaminations of incomes for households occupying assisted units or residential spaces, collection of tenant payments, termination of tenancy and eviction, and all repair and maintenance functions (including ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and replacement of capital items). All functions must be performed in compliance with equal opportunity requirements.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting for services.</E> (1) With HUD approval, the Owner may contract with a private or public entity for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, such an arrangement does not relieve the Owner of responsibility for these services and duties. All such contracts are subject to the restrictions governing prohibited contractual relationships described in § 891.130. (These prohibitions do not extend to management contracts entered into by the Owner with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate.)</P>
              <P>(2) Consistent with the objectives of Executive Order No. 11625 (36 FR 19967, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616; as amended by Executive Order No. 12007 (42 FR 42839, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 139)); Executive Order No. 12432 (48 FR 32551, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198); and Executive Order No. 12138 (44 FR 29637, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393; as amended by Executive Order No. 12608 (52 FR 34617, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 245)), the Owner will promote awareness and participation of minority and women's business enterprises in contracting and procurement activities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of financial and operating statements.</E> The Owner must submit to HUD:</P>
              <P>(1) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of project operations, financial statements for the project audited by an independent public accountant and in the form required by HUD; and</P>
              <P>(2) Other statements regarding project operation, financial conditions and occupancy as HUD may require to administer the PRAC and to monitor project operations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of project funds.</E> The Owner shall maintain a separate interest bearing project fund account in a depository or depositories which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and shall deposit all tenant payments, charges, income and revenues arising from project operation or ownership to this account. All project funds are to be deposited in Federally insured accounts. All balances shall be fully insured at all times, to the maximum extent possible. Project funds must be used for the operation of the project (including required insurance coverage), and to make required deposits to the replacement reserve under § 891.405, in accordance with HUD-approved budget. Any remaining project funds in the project funds account (including earned interest) following the expiration of the fiscal year shall be deposited in a Federally-insured residual receipts account within 60 days following the end of the <PRTPAGE P="200"/>fiscal year. Withdrawals from this account may be made only for project purposes and with the approval of HUD. If there are funds remaining in the residual receipts account when the mortgage is satisfied, such funds shall be returned to HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Reports.</E> The Owner shall submit such reports as HUD may prescribe to demonstrate compliance with applicable civil rights and equal opportunity requirements. See § 891.410(a).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of reserve.</E> The Owner shall establish and maintain a replacement reserve to aid in funding extraordinary maintenance and repair and replacement of capital items.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Deposits to reserve.</E> The Owner shall make monthly deposits to the replacement reserve in an amount determined by HUD.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Level of reserve.</E> The reserve must be built up to and maintained at a level determined by HUD to be sufficient to meet projected requirements. Should the reserve reach that level, the amount of the deposit to the reserve may be reduced with the approval of HUD.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Administration of reserve.</E> Replacement reserve funds must be deposited with HUD or in a Federally-insured depository in an interest-bearing account(s) whose balances(s) are fully insured at all times. All earnings including interest on the reserve must be added to the reserve. Funds may be drawn from the reserve and used only in accordance with HUD guidelines and with the approval of, or as directed by, HUD. With HUD approval, reserves may be used to reduce the number of dwelling units, provided that the purpose for the reduction is the retrofitting of obsolete or unmarketable units.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Selection and admission of tenants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Written procedures.</E> The Owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly persons and persons with disabilities (as applicable); and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Owners shall promptly inform in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, Owners shall maintain a written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender, ethnicity, and date of each person applying for the program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for admission.</E> The Owner must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD, and (under the Section 202 Program only) is obligated to confirm all information provided by applicant families on the application. Applicant households applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group home) must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant households must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Applicant families must sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Owner and the applicant household must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Owner must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.</E> (1) The Owner is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for the selection of households. To be eligible for admission, an applicant must be an elderly person or a person with disabilities, as applicable (as defined in §§ 891.205 and 891.305, respectively); must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; must sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, <PRTPAGE P="201"/>subpart B; and must be a very low-income family, as defined in § 891.105.</P>
              <P>(2) Under the Section 811 Program:</P>
              <P>(i) In order to be eligible for admission, the applicant must also meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD.</P>
              <P>(ii) Owners shall make selections in a nondiscriminatory manner without regard to considerations such as race, religion, color, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. An Owner may, with the approval of the Secretary, limit occupancy within housing developed under this part 891 to persons with disabilities who have similar disabilities and require a similar set of supportive services in a supportive housing environment. However, the Owner must permit occupancy by any qualified person with a disability who could benefit from the housing and/or services provided regardless of the person's disability.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit assignment.</E> If the Owner determines that the household is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home) are available, the Owner will assign the household a unit or residential space in a group home. If the household will occupy an assisted unit, the Owner will assign the household a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available, the Owner will place the household on a waiting list for the project and notify the household when a suitable unit or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the Owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Ineligibility determination.</E> If the Owner determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Owner is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Owner will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and the applicant's right to request a meeting to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Owner's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights (e.g., rights granted under Federal, State or local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being discriminated against on a prohibited basis.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Records.</E> Records on applicants and approved eligible households, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be retained for three years. See § 891.410(a).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Reexamination of household family income and composition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The Owner must reexamine the income and composition of the household at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Owner must make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter, as modified by § 891.105, and must determine whether the household's unit size is still appropriate. The Owner must adjust tenant payment and the project rental assistance payment, and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with HUD standards. At the time of reexamination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Owner must require the household to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The household must comply with the provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Owner receives information concerning a change in the household's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Owner must consult with the household and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. See 24 CFR part 5, subpart B for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Number at interim reexaminations involving new household members. For requirements regarding the signing and <PRTPAGE P="202"/>submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Any change in the household's income or other circumstances that result in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant payment, and project rental assistance payment must be verified.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Continuation of project rental assistance payment.</E> (i) A household shall remain eligible for project rental assistance payment until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the household's other rights under its lease. Project rental assistance payment may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PRAC, the household meets the income eligibility requirements of 24 CFR part 813 (as modified in § 891.105) and project rental assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PRAC. The household will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A household's eligibility for project rental assistance payment may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination.</E> An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).</P>

If possible, the Owner will, as promptly as possible, offer the household an appropriate alternate unit.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Collection of security deposits.</E> At the time of the initial execution of the lease, the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) will require each household (or family, as applicable) occupying an assisted unit or residential space in a group home to pay a security deposit in an amount equal to one month's tenant payment or $50, whichever is greater. The household (or family) is expected to pay the security deposit from its own resources and other available public or private resources. The Owner (or Borrower) may collect the security deposit on an installment basis.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Security deposit provisions applicable to units</E>—(1) <E T="03">Administration of security deposit.</E> The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) must place the security deposits in a segregated interest-bearing account. The amount of the segregated, interest-bearing account maintained by the Owner (or Borrower) must at all times equal the total amount collected from the households (or families, as applicable) then in occupancy plus any accrued interest and less allowable administrative cost adjustments. The Owner (or Borrower) must comply with any applicable State and local laws concerning interest payments on security deposits.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Household (or family, as applicable) notification requirement.</E> In order to be considered for the refund of the security deposit, a household (or family) must provide the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) with a forwarding address or arrange to pick up the refund.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Use of security deposit.</E> The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable), subject to State and local law and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, may use the household's (or family's, as applicable) security deposit balance as reimbursement for any unpaid amounts that the household (or <PRTPAGE P="204"/>family) owes under the lease. Within 30 days (or shorter time if required by State or local law) after receiving notification under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Owner (or Borrower) must:</P>
              <P>(i) Refund to a household (or family) that does not owe any amount under the lease the full amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Provide to a household (or family) owing amounts under the lease a list itemizing each amount, along with a statement of the household's (or family's) rights under State and local law. If the amount that the Owner (or Borrower) claims is owed by the household (or family) is less than the amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance, the Owner (or Borrower) must refund the excess balance to the household (or family). If the Owner (or Borrower) fails to provide the list, the household (or family) will be entitled to the refund of the full amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disagreements.</E> If a disagreement arises concerning reimbursement of the security deposit, the household (or family, if applicable) will have the right to present objections to the Owner (or Borrower, if applicable) in an informal meeting. The Owner (or Borrower) must keep a record of any disagreements and meetings in a tenant file for inspection by HUD. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the household (or family) from exercising its rights under State or local law.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Decedent's interest in security deposit.</E> Upon the death of a member of a household (or family, as applicable), the decedent's interest, if any, in the security deposit will be governed by State or local law.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reimbursement by HUD for assisted units.</E> If the household's (or family's, if applicable) security deposit balance is insufficient to reimburse the Owner (or Borrower, if applicable) for any amount that the household (or family) owes under the lease for an assisted unit or residential space, and the Owner (or Borrower) has provided the household (or family) with the list required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the Owner (or Borrower) may claim reimbursement from HUD for an amount not to exceed the lesser of:</P>
              <P>(1) The amount owed the Owner (or Borrower); or</P>
              <P>(2) One month's per unit operating cost (or contract rent, if applicable), minus the amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance. Any reimbursement under this section will be applied first toward any unpaid tenant payment (or rent, if applicable) due under the lease. No reimbursement may be claimed for any unpaid tenant payment (or rent) for the period after termination of the tenancy. The Owner (or Borrower) may be eligible for vacancy payments following a vacancy in accordance with the requirements of § 891.445 (or §§ 891.650 or 891.790, as applicable).</P>

The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) must submit an analysis of any utility allowances applicable. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the utility allowances for assisted units. In addition, when utility rate changes would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved utility allowances, the Owner (or Borrower) must advise HUD and request approval of new utility allowances. Whenever a utility allowance for an assisted unit is adjusted, the Owner (or Borrower) will promptly notify affected households (or families, as applicable) and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant payment (or rent, as applicable) and the amount of the project rental assistance payment (or housing or project assistance payment, as applicable).</P>

The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Definition of a displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project including any permanent move from the real property that is made:</P>
              <P>(i) After notice by the Sponsor/Borrower to move permanently from the property if the move occurs on or after:</P>
              <P>(A) The date of the submission of an application to HUD that is later approved, if the Sponsor has control of an appropriate site; or</P>
              <P>(B) The date that the Sponsor obtains control of an approvable site, if such control is obtained after the submission of an application to HUD:</P>
              <P>(ii) Before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if the Sponsor, Borrower or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;</P>
              <P>(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs;</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant moves after execution of the Agreement between the Sponsor/Borrower and HUD, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the Agreement; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 813.107, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or</P>
              <P>(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or</P>
              <P>(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, however, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance at URA levels), if:</P>
              <P>(i) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance.</P>
              <P>(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., displacement, temporary relocation or a rent increase) and the fact that he or she will not qualify as a displaced person as a result of the project;</P>
              <P>(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or</P>
              <P>(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;</P>
              <P>(3) The Sponsor/Borrower may request, at any time, a HUD determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.</P>

Individuals from one eligible group may not be accepted for occupancy in a project designed for a different tenant group. However, a Sponsor can propose to house eligible tenant groups other than the one it was selected to serve, but must apply to the HUD field office for permission to do so, based on a plan that demonstrates that it can adequately serve the proposed tenant group. Upon review and recommendation by the field office, HUD Headquarters will approve or disapprove the request.</P>

                <P>(e) <E T="03">Adjusted loan amount—rehabilitation projects.</E> A loan amount that involves a project to be rehabilitated shall be subject to the following additional limitations:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Property held in fee.</E> If the Borrower is the fee simple owner of the project not encumbered by a mortgage, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed 100 percent of the cost of the proposed rehabilitation.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Property subject to existing mortgage.</E> If the Borrower owns the project subject to an outstanding indebtedness, which is to be refinanced with part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of rehabilitation plus such portion of the outstanding indebtedness as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Property to be acquired.</E> If the project is to be acquired by the Borrower and the purchase price is to be financed with a part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of the rehabilitation plus such portion of the purchase price as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Increased Mortgage Limits—High Cost Areas.</E> (1)(i) The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</P>

                <P>(B) By not to exceed 140 percent where the Assistant Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis.</P>
                <P>(ii) In no case, however, may any such increase exceed 90 percent, where the Assistant Secretary determines that there is involved a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in implementing its Special Assistance Functions under section 305 of the National Housing Act (as section 305 existed immediately before its repeal on November 30, 1983).</P>

                <P>(2) If the Assistant Secretary finds that because of high costs in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii it is not feasible to <PRTPAGE P="211"/>construct dwellings without the sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability within the limitations of maximum loan amounts provided in this section, the principal amount of mortgages may be increased by such amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such costs, but not to exceed in any event the maximum, including high cost area increases, if any, otherwise applicable by more than one-half thereof.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Loan interest rate.</E> Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by HUD in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Annual interest rate.</E> Except as provided under paragraph (g)(2), loans shall bear interest at the rate in effect at the time the loan is made. The loan interest rate shall not exceed:</P>
                <P>(i) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the loan is made (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional interest rate.</E> The Borrower may elect an optional loan interest rate. To elect the optional rate, the Borrower must request that HUD determine the loan interest rate at the time of the Borrower's request for conditional or firm commitment for direct loan financing.</P>
                <P>(i) If the Borrower elects the optional loan interest rate, the loan interest rate shall not exceed:</P>
                <P>(A) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program;</P>
                <P>(B) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 1-month period immediately preceding the month in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover the administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and (C) Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program.</P>
                <P>(ii) The date of submission of a request for conditional or firm commitment is the date that the Borrower submits the complete and acceptable request to HUD. The date of the submission of a request for commitment will not be affected by any subsequent resubmission of the request by the Borrower or by any reprocessing of the request by HUD.</P>
                <P>(iii) The Borrower may withdraw its election of the optional interest rate at any time before initial loan closing. If the Borrower elected the optional interest rate with its request for conditional commitment and withdraws its election, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, unless the Borrower elects an optional interest rate with its request for firm commitment. If the Borrower withdraws its election after the date of submission of its request for firm commitment, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iv) If initial loan closing has not occurred within 18 months after the Notice of Section 202 Fund Reservation is issued, the Borrower's election of the optional rate will be cancelled and the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Allowance for administrative costs and probable losses.</E> For the purpose of computing the loan interest rate under paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program is one-fourth of one percent (.25%) per annum for both the construction and permanent loan periods.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Announcement of interest rates.</E> (1) HUD will annually announce the loan interest rate determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section by publishing notice of the rate in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                  <PRTPAGE P="212"/>notice will include a statement explaining the basis for the interest rate determination.</P>
                <P>(2) Upon the Borrower's request, HUD will provide available current information concerning the determination of the interest rate under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(i) The loan shall be secured by a first mortgage on real estate in fee simple or long term leasehold. The mortgage shall be repayable during a term not to exceed 40 years and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Assistant Secretary.</P>
                <P>(j) In order to assure HUD of the Borrower's continued commitment to the development, management, and operation of the project, a minimum capital investment is required of Section 202 Borrowers of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the mortgage amount committed to be disbursed, not to exceed the amount of $10,000. Section 106(b) loans made pursuant to section 106 of the Housing Act of 1968 may not be utilized to meet the minimum capital investment requirement. Such minimum capital investment shall be placed in escrow at the initial closing of the Section 202 loan and shall be held by HUD or other escrow agent acceptable to the field office for not less than a 3-year period from the date of initial occupancy and may be used for operating expenses or deficits as may be directed by the field office. Any unexpended balance remaining in the minimum capital investment account at the end of the escrow period shall be returned to the Borrower.</P>

                <P>(a) Disbursements of loan proceeds shall be made directly by HUD to or for the account of the Borrower and may be made through an approved lender, mortgage servicer, title insurance company, or other agent satisfactory to the Borrower and HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) All disbursements to the Borrower shall be made on a periodic basis in an amount not to exceed the HUD-approved cost of portions of construction or rehabilitation work completed and in place (except as modified in paragraph (d) of this section), minus the appropriate holdback, as determined by the field office.</P>
                <P>(c) Requisitions for loan disbursements shall be submitted by the Borrower on forms to be prescribed by the Assistant Secretary and shall be accompanied by such additional information as the field office may require in order to approve loan disbursements under subpart E of this part, including but not limited to evidence of compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, Department of Labor regulations, all applicable zoning, building, and other governmental requirements, and such evidence of continued priority of the mortgage of the Borrower as the Assistant Secretary may prescribe.</P>

                <P>(d) In loan disbursements for building components stored off-site, the term <E T="03">building component</E> shall mean any manufactured or preassembled part of a structure as defined by HUD and that the Assistant Secretary has designated for off-site storage because it is of such size or weight that storage of the components required for timely construction progress at the construction site is impractical, or weather damage or other adverse conditions prevailing at the construction site would make storage at the site impractical or unduly costly. Each building component must be specifically identified for incorporation into the property as provided <PRTPAGE P="214"/>under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Storage.</E> (i) A loan disbursement may be made for up to 90 percent of the invoice value (to exclude costs of transportation and storage) of the building components stored off-site if the components are stored at a location approved by HUD.</P>
                <P>(ii) Each building component shall be adequately marked so as to be readily identifiable in the inventory of the off-site location. It shall be kept together with all other building components of the same manufacturer intended for use in the same project for which loan disbursements have been made and separate and apart from similar units not for use in the project.</P>
                <P>(iii) Storage costs, if any, shall be borne the general contractor.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Responsibility for transportation, storage and insurance of off-site building components.</E> The general contractor of the project shall have the responsibility for:</P>
                <P>(i) Insuring the components in the name of the Borrower while in transit and storage; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Delivering or contracting for the delivery of the components to the storage area and to the construction site, including payment of freight.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Loan disbursements.</E> (i) Before a loan disbursement for a building component stored off-site is made, the Borrower shall:</P>
                <P>(A) Obtain a bill of sale for the component;</P>
                <P>(B) Provide HUD with a security agreement pledged by a first lien on the building components with the exception of such other liens or encumbrances as may be approved by HUD; and</P>
                <P>(C) File a financing statement in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code.</P>
                <P>(ii) Before each loan disbursement for building components stored off-site is made the manufacturer and the general contractor shall certify to HUD that the components, in their intended use, comply with HUD-approved contract plan and specifications.</P>
                <P>(iii) Loan disbursements may be made only for components stored off-site in a quantity required to permit uninterrupted installation at the site.</P>
                <P>(iv) At no time shall the invoice value of building components being stored off-site, for which advances have been insured, represent more than 25 percent of the total estimated construction costs for the insured mortgaged project as specified in the construction contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and other regulatory requirements that set bonding requirements, the percentage of total estimated construction costs insured by advances under this section may exceed 25 percent but not 50 percent if the mortgagor furnishes assurance of completion in the form of a corporate surety bond for the payment and performance each in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the construction contract. In no event will insurance of components stored off-site be made in the absence of a payment and performance bond.</P>
                <P>(v) No single loan disbursement which is to be made shall be in an amount less than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars.</P>

                <P>(2) A verification of the Certificate of Actual Cost by an independent Certified Public Accountant or independent public accountant acceptable to the field office.</P>

                <P>(3) In the case of projects not subject to competitive bidding, a certification of the general contractor (and of such <PRTPAGE P="215"/>subcontractors, material suppliers, and equipment lessors as the Assistant Secretary or field office may require), on a form prescribed by the Assistant Secretary, as to all actual costs paid for labor, materials, and subcontract work under the general contract exclusive of the builder's fee and kickbacks, rebates, trade discounts, or other similar payments to the general contractor, the mortgagor, or any of its officers, directors, stockholders, partners, or members.</P>
                <P>(c) In lieu of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (3) of this section, a simplified form of cost certification prescribed by the Secretary may be completed and submitted by the Borrower for projects with mortgages of $500,000 or less.

                <P>(d) If the Borrower's certified costs provided in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section and as approved by HUD are less than the loan amount, the contract rents will be reduced accordingly.</P>
                <P>(e) If the contract rents are reduced pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the maximum annual HAP Contract commitment will be reduced. If contract rents are reduced based on cost certification after HAP Contract execution, any overpayment after the effective date of the Contract will be recovered from the Borrower by HUD.</P>

The project account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the HAP contract each year. HUD will make payments from this account for housing assistance payments as needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant income and other payments for costs specifically approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(2) If the HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the HAP contract for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment for that fiscal year plus the current balance in the project account, HUD will, within a reasonable time, take such steps authorized by section 8(c)(6) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note), as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the HAP contract will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant income.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Leasing to eligible families.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.</E> (1) During the term of the HAP contract, a Borrower shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:</P>
                <P>(i) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 891.600(a);</P>
                <P>(ii) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families;</P>
                <P>(iii) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract to eligible families, one or more units may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the HAP contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the HAP contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the HAP contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of number of units covered by the HAP contract.</E> HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the HAP contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:</P>
                <P>(1) The Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> HUD will agree to an amendment of the HAP contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made under paragraph (b) of this section if:<PRTPAGE P="217"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;</P>
                <P>(2) The Borrower otherwise has a record of compliance with the Borrower's obligations under the HAP contract; and</P>
                <P>(3) Contract and budget authority is available.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Occupancy by families that are not elderly or handicapped.</E> HUD may permit units in the project to be leased to other than elderly or handicapped families if:</P>
                <P>(1) The Borrower has made reasonable efforts to lease assisted and unassisted units to eligible families;</P>
                <P>(2) The Borrower has been granted HUD approval under paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) The Borrower is temporarily unable to achieve or maintain a level of occupancy sufficient to prevent financial default and foreclosure under the Section 202 loan documents. HUD approval under paragraph (e)(3) of this section will be of limited duration. HUD may impose terms and conditions to this approval that are consistent with program objectives and necessary to protect its interest in the Section 202 loan.</P>
                <P>(f) The regulations of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.</P>

The number of assisted units under the extended or renewed HAP contract shall equal the number of assisted units under the original HAP contract, except that:</P>
                <P>(a) HUD and the Borrower may agree to reduce the number of assisted units by the number of assisted units that are not occupied by eligible families at the time of the extension or renewal; and</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketing.</E> (1) The Borrower must commence and continue diligent marketing activities not later than 90 days before the anticipated date of availability for occupancy of the first unit of the project. Market activities shall include the provision of notices of availability of housing under the program to operators of temporary housing for the homeless in the same housing market.</P>
                <P>(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan and all Federal, State, or local fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the plan and requirements is to achieve a condition in which eligible families of similar income levels in the same housing market have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of discriminatory considerations, such as their race, color, creed, religion, familial status, disability, sex or national origin. Marketing must also be done in accordance with the communication and notice requirements of Section 504 at 24 CFR 8.6 and 24 CFR 8.54.</P>
                <P>(3) At the time of HAP contract execution, the Borrower must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units, with a justification for the unleased units, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Management and maintenance.</E> The Borrower is responsible for all management functions. These functions include selection and admission of tenants, required reexaminations of incomes for families occupying assisted units (or residential spaces, as applicable), collection of rents, termination of tenancy and eviction, and all repair and maintenance functions (including ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and replacement of capital items). All functions must be performed in compliance with equal opportunity requirements.<PRTPAGE P="219"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting for services.</E> (1) With HUD approval, the Borrower may contract with a private or public entity for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, such an arrangement does not relieve the Borrower of responsibility for these services and duties. All such contracts are subject to the restrictions governing prohibited contractual relationships described in §§ 891.130 and 891.505, if applicable. (These prohibitions do not extend to management contracts entered into by the Borrower with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate).</P>
                <P>(2) Consistent with the objectives of Executive Order No. 11625 (36 FR 19967, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616; as amended by Executive Order No. 12007 (42 FR 42839, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 139; unless otherwise noted); Executive Order No. 12432 (48 FR 32551, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198; unless otherwise noted); and Executive Order No. 12138 (44 FR 29637, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393; unless otherwise noted), the Borrower will promote awareness and participation of minority and women's business enterprises in contracting and procurement activities.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of financial and operating statements.</E> The Borrower must submit to HUD:</P>
                <P>(1) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of project operations, financial statements for the project audited by an independent public accountant and in the form required by HUD; and</P>
                <P>(2) Other statements regarding project operation, financial conditions and occupancy as HUD may require to administer the housing assistance payments contract (HAP contract) or the project assistance contract (PAC), as applicable, and to monitor project operations.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of project funds.</E> The Borrower shall maintain a separate project fund account in a depository or depositories that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and shall deposit all rents, charges, income and revenues arising from project operation or ownership to this account. All project funds are to be deposited in Federally-insured accounts. All balances shall be fully insured at all times, to the maximum extent possible. Project funds must be used for the operation of the project (including required insurance coverage), to make required principal and interest payments on the Section 202 loan, and to make required deposits to the replacement reserve under §§ 891.605 and 891.745 (as applicable), in accordance with a HUD-approved budget. Any project funds in the project funds account (including earned interest) following the expiration of the fiscal year shall be deposited in a Federally-insured residual receipts account within 60 days following the end of the fiscal year. Withdrawals from this account may be made only for project purposes and with the approval of HUD. If there are funds remaining in the residual receipts account when the mortgage is satisfied, such funds shall be returned to HUD.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Reports.</E> The Borrower shall submit such reports as HUD may prescribe to demonstrate compliance with applicable civil rights and equal opportunity requirements.</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Level of reserve.</E> The reserve must be built up to and maintained at a level determined by HUD to be sufficient to meet projected requirements.

                <SUBJECT>Selection and admission of tenants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Written procedures.</E> The Owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly or handicapped persons; and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Owners shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, owners shall maintain a written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender, ethnicity and date of each person applying for the program.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Application for admission.</E> The Borrower must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD and is obligated to confirm all information provided by the applicant families on the application. Applicant families must be requested to complete a release of information consent for verification of information. Applicants applying for assisted units must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.</E> The borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for selection of families. To be eligible for admission, an applicant must be an elderly or handicapped family as defined in § 891.505; meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirement for Social Security numbers and sign and submit consent forms for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and, if applying for an assisted unit, be eligible for admission under subpart F of 24 CFR part 5, which governs selection of tenants and occupancy requirements. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Unit assignment.</E> If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit. The Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason, except that the Borrower may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for assistance and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Ineligibility determination.</E> If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and that the applicant has a right to request a meeting with the Borrower or managing agent to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The <PRTPAGE P="221"/>review, if requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights (e.g., rights granted under Federal, State, or local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being discriminated against on a prohibited basis. The informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal preference are provided in § 5.410(g) of this title.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Records.</E> Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender, handicap status, and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be retained for three years.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Reexamination of family income and composition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> The Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the housing assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with the administrative instructions issued by HUD. At the time of reexamination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> The family must comply with the provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent and housing assistance payment must be verified.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Continuation of housing assistance payments.</E> (i) A family shall remain eligible for housing assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent. The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Housing assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent or other relevant circumstances during the term of the HAP contract, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter and housing assistance is available for the unit under the terms of the HAP contract. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) A family's eligibility for housing assistance payments may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State wage information collection agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination.</E> An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).</P>

                <P>The general requirements for security deposits on assisted units are provided in § 891.435. For purposes of subpart E of this part, the additional requirements apply:</P>
                <P>(a) The Borrower may require each family occupying an unassisted unit (or residential space in a group home) to pay a security deposit equal to one month's rent payable by the family.</P>
                <P>(b) The Borrower shall maintain a record of the amount in the segregated interest-bearing account that is attributable to each family in residence in the project. Annually for all families, and when computing the amount available for disbursement under § 891.435(b)(3), the Borrower shall allocate to the family's balance the interest accrued on the balance during the year. Unless prohibited by State or local law, the Borrower may deduct for the family, from the accrued interest for the year, the administrative cost of computing the allocation to the family's balance. The amount of the administrative cost adjustment shall not exceed the accrued interest allocated to the family's balance for the year.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Contract rents</E>—(1) <E T="03">Adjustment based on approved budget.</E> If the HAP contract provides, or has been amended to provide, that contract rents will be adjusted based upon a HUD-approved budget, HUD will calculate contract rent adjustments based on the sum of the project's operating costs and debt service (as calculated by HUD), with adjustments for vacancies, the project's nonrental income, and other factors that HUD deems appropriate. The calculation will be made on the basis of information provided by the Borrower on a form acceptable to the Secretary. The automatic adjustment factor described in part 888 of this chapter is not used to adjust contract rents under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except to the extent that the amount of the replacement reserve deposit is adjusted under § 880.602 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual and special adjustments.</E> If the HAP contract provides that contract rents will be adjusted based on the application of an automatic adjustment factor and by special additional adjustments:</P>
                <P>(i) Consistent with the HAP contract, contract rents may be adjusted in accordance with part 888 of this chapter;</P>
                <P>(ii) Special additional adjustments will be granted, to the extent determined necessary by HUD, to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the assisted units that have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates or similar costs (i.e., assessments and utilities not covered by regulated rates), and that are not adequately compensated for by an annual adjustment. The Borrower must submit to HUD required supporting data, financial statements, and certifications for the special additional adjustment.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rent for unassisted units.</E> The rent payable by families occupying units that are not assisted under the HAP contract shall be equal to the contract <PRTPAGE P="223"/>rent computed under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Vacancies during rent-up.</E> For each unit that is not leased as of the effective date of the HAP contract, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy, if the Borrower:</P>
                <P>(1) Complied with § 891.600;</P>
                <P>(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and</P>

                <P>(c) <E T="03">Vacancies after rent-up.</E> If an eligible family vacates a unit, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy if the Borrower:</P>
                <P>(1) Certifies that it did not cause the vacancy by violating the lease, the HAP contract, or any applicable law;</P>
                <P>(2) Notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy immediately upon learning of the vacancy or prospective vacancy;</P>
                <P>(3) Has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in § 891.600(a)(2) and (3), and in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section; and</P>

                <P>(d) <E T="03">Vacancies for longer than 60 days.</E> If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Borrower may apply to receive additional vacancy payments in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt service attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months for the unit if:</P>
                <P>(1) The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payment is claimed;</P>
                <P>(2) The Borrower has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate; and</P>
                <P>(3) The Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HUD that:</P>
                <P>(i) For the period of vacancy, the project is not providing the Borrower with revenues at least equal to project expenses (exclusive of depreciation) and the amount of payments requested is not more than the portion of the deficiency attributable to the vacant unit; and</P>
                <P>(ii) The project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.</E> If the Borrower collects payments for vacancies from other sources (tenant rent, security deposits, payments under § 891.435(c), or governmental payments under other programs), the Borrower shall not be entitled to collect vacancy payments to the extent these collections from other sources plus the vacancy payment exceed contract rent.</P>

                <P>(1) Group homes may not be designed to serve more than 15 persons on one site;</P>
                <P>(2) Independent living complexes for chronically mentally ill individuals may not be designed to serve more than 20 persons on one site; and</P>

Amenities not eligible for HUD funding include balconies, atriums, decks, bowling alleys, swimming pools, saunas, and jacuzzis. Dishwashers, trash compactors, and washers and dryers in individual units will not be funded in independent living complexes. The use of durable materials to control or reduce maintenance, repair, and replacement costs is not an excess amenity.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Unit sizes.</E> For independent living complexes, HUD will establish limitations on the size of units and number of bathrooms, based on the number of bedrooms that are in the unit.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Project assistance contract.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Project assistance contract (PAC).</E> The PAC sets forth rights and duties of the Borrower and HUD with respect to the project and the project assistance payments.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">PAC execution.</E> (1) Upon satisfactory completion of the project, the Borrower and HUD shall execute the PAC on the form prescribed by HUD.<PRTPAGE P="227"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) The effective date of the PAC may be earlier than the date of execution, but no earlier than the date of HUD's issuance of the permission to occupy.</P>
                <P>(3) If the project is completed in stages, the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to each stage.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Project assistance payments to owners under the PAC.</E> The project assistance payments made under the PAC are:</P>
                <P>(1) Payments to the Borrower to assist eligible families leasing assisted units. The amount of the project assistance payment made to the Borrower for an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) that is leased to an eligible family is equal to the difference between the contract rent for the unit (or pro rata share of the contract rent in a group home) and the tenant rent payable by the family.</P>
                <P>(2) Payments to the Borrower for vacant assisted units (“vacancy payments”). The amount of and conditions for vacancy payments are described in § 891.790. HUD makes the project assistance payments monthly upon proper requisition by the Borrower, except payments for vacancies of more than 60 days, which HUD makes semiannually upon requisition by the Borrower.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of utility reimbursement.</E> If applicable, a utility reimbursement will be paid to a family occupying an assisted unit in an independent living complex as an additional project assistance payment. The PAC will provide that the Borrower will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Borrower in trust solely for the purpose of making the additional payment. The Borrower may pay the utility reimbursement jointly to the family and the utility company, or, if the family and utility company consent, directly to the utility company.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Maximum annual commitment.</E> The maximum annual amount that may be committed under the PAC is the total of the initial contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Project account.</E> (1) HUD will establish and maintain a specifically identified and segregated project account for each project. The project account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the PAC each year. HUD will make payments from this account for project assistance payments as needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant income and other payments for costs specifically approved by the Secretary.</P>
                <P>(2) If the HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the PAC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment for that fiscal year plus the current balance in the project account, HUD will, within a reasonable time, take such steps authorized by section 202(h)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1959, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the PAC will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant income.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Leasing to eligible families.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.</E> During the term of the PAC, a Borrower shall make all units (or residential spaces in a group home) available for eligible families. For purposes of this section, making units or residential spaces available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:</P>
                <P>(1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 891.740(a);</P>

                <P>(2) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units or residential spaces to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units or residential spaces to eligible families, one or more units or <PRTPAGE P="228"/>residential spaces may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income requirements of part 813 of this chapter, as modified by § 891.505. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the PAC and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the PAC, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units (or in the case of group homes, reduction of the number of residential spaces) under the PAC as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduction of number of units covered by the PAC.</E> HUD may reduce the number of units (or in the case of group homes, the number of residential spaces) covered by the PAC to the number of units or residential spaces available for occupancy by eligible families if:</P>
                <P>(1) The Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or</P>
                <P>(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD, HUD determines that the inability to lease units or residential spaces to eligible families is not a temporary problem.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Restoration.</E> HUD will agree to an amendment of the PAC to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made under paragraph (b) of this section if:</P>
                <P>(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;</P>
                <P>(2) The Borrower otherwise has a record of compliance with the Borrower's obligations under the PAC; and</P>
                <P>(3) Contract and budget authority is available.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Occupancy by families that are not handicapped.</E> HUD may relieve the Borrower of the requirement that all units in the project (or residential spaces in a group home) must be leased to handicapped families if:</P>
                <P>(1) The Borrower has made reasonable efforts to lease to eligible families;</P>
                <P>(2) The Borrower has been granted HUD approval under paragraph (a) of this section; and</P>
                <P>(3) The Borrower is temporarily unable to achieve or maintain a level of occupancy sufficient to prevent financial default and foreclosure under the Section 202 loan documents. HUD approval under this paragraph will be of limited duration. HUD may impose terms and conditions to this approval that are consistent with program objectives and necessary to protect its interest in the Section 202 loan.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Marketing.</E> (1) The Borrower must commence and continue diligent marketing activities not later than 90 days before the anticipated date of availability for occupancy of the group <PRTPAGE P="229"/>home or the anticipated date of availability of the first unit in an independent living complex. Market activities shall include the provision of notices of the availability of housing under the program to operators of temporary housing for the homeless in the same housing market.</P>
                <P>(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan and all fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the plan and requirements is to achieve a condition in which eligible families of similar income levels in the same housing market have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(3) At the time of PAC execution, the Borrower must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units (or in the case of a group home, leased and unleased residential spaces) with a justification for the unleased units or residential spaces, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units or residential spaces.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Management and maintenance.</E> The responsibilities of the Borrower with regard to management and maintenance are provided in § 891.600(b).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting for services.</E> The responsibilities of the Borrower with regard to contracting for services are provided in § 891.600(c).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of financial and operating statements.</E> The responsibilities of the Borrower with regard to the submission of financial and operating statements are provided in § 891.600(d).</P>

For projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790, the amount of the deposits for the initial year of operation shall be an amount equal to 0.6 percent of the cost of the total structures (for new construction projects), 0.4 percent of the cost of the initial mortgage amount (for all other projects), or such higher rate as required by HUD. For the purposes of this section, total structures include main buildings, accessory buildings, garages, and other buildings. The amount of the deposits will be adjusted each year by the amount of the annual adjustment factor as described in part 888 of this chapter.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Selection and admission of tenants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Application for admission.</E> The Borrower must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Applicant families applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group home) must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant family must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.</E> The Borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for the selection of families. To be eligible for admission, an applicant family must be a handicapped family (as defined in § 891.505); meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and be a low-income family, as defined in § 813.102 of this chapter (as modified by § 891.505). Under certain circumstances, HUD may permit the leasing of units (or residential space in a group home) to ineligible families under § 891.720.</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Local residency requirements are prohibited.</E> Local residency preferences may be applied in selecting tenants <PRTPAGE P="230"/>only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with affirmative fair housing marketing objectives and the Borrower's HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan. Preferences may not be based on the length of time the applicant has resided in the jurisdiction. With respect to any residency preference, persons expected to reside in the community as a result of current or planned employment will be treated as residents.</P>
                <P>(2) If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home) are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit or residential space in a group home. If the family will occupy an assisted unit the Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family when a suitable unit or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason.</P>
                <P>(3) If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and that the applicant has a right to request a meeting to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by the member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights if the applicant believes the applicant is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, handicap, or national origin.</P>
                <P>(4) Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be maintained and retained for three years.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Reexamination of family income and composition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Regular reexaminations.</E> If the family occupies an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home), the Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter, as modified by § 891.505, and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the project assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with HUD standards. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim reexamination.</E> If the family occupies an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) the family must comply with provisions in the lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent, and project assistance payment must be verified.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Continuation of project assistance payment.</E> (i) A family occupying an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) shall remain eligible for project assistance payment until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Project assistance payment may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PAC, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter (as modified in § 891.505) <PRTPAGE P="231"/>and project assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PAC. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) A family's eligibility for project assistance payment may also be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination.</E> An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Capital advance funds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) HUD is authorized to provide capital advance funds to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs. For mixed-finance projects, HUD provides a capital advance funds reservation to the sponsor, which transfers the fund reservation to the mixed-finance owner meeting the requirements of this subpart. The sponsor may transfer the fund reservation directly to the owner or to the general partner of the owner, or the sponsor may be the general partner of the mixed-finance owner if the sponsor meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) Developments built with mixed-finance funds may combine Section 202 or Section 811 units with other units, which may or may not benefit from federal assistance. The number of Section 202 or Section 811 supportive housing units must not be less than the number specified in the agreement letter for a capital advance. In the case of a Section 811 mixed-finance project, the additional units cannot cause the project to exceed the applicable Section 811 project size limit if they will also house persons with disabilities.</P>

              <P>(c) The owner must ensure that Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units in the development are and continue to be comparable to unassisted units in terms of location, size, appearance, and amenities. If due to a change in the partnership structure it becomes necessary to establish a new owner partnership or to transfer the supportive housing project, the new or revised owner must be a single-purpose entity and the use restrictions must remain in effect as provided above.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose, scope, and general matters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) is to improve the delivery of services in public housing and enhance trust in the public housing system among public housing agencies (PHAs), public housing residents, and the general public, by providing a management tool for effectively and fairly measuring the performance of a PHA in essential housing operations of projects, on a program-wide basis and individual project basis, and providing rewards for high performers and remedial requirements for poor performers.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> PHAS is a strategic measure of the essential housing operations of projects and PHAs. PHAS does not evaluate the compliance of a project or PHA with every HUD-wide or program-specific requirement or objective. Although not specifically evaluated through PHAS, PHAs are responsible for complying with nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, including but not limited to those specified in 24 CFR 5.105, for affirmatively furthering fair housing, requirements under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and requirements of other federal programs under which the PHA is receiving assistance. A PHA's adherence to these requirements will be monitored in accordance with the applicable program regulations and the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PHAS indicators.</E> HUD will assess and score the performance of projects and PHAs based on the indicators, which are more fully addressed in § 902.9: Physical condition, financial condition, management operations, and the Capital Fund program.<PRTPAGE P="242"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assessment tools.</E> HUD will make use of uniform and objective criteria for the physical inspection of projects and PHAs and the financial assessment of projects and PHAs, and will use data from appropriate agency data systems to assess management operations. For the Capital Fund program indicator, HUD will use information provided in the electronic Line of Credit Control System (eLOCCS), the Public Housing Information Center (PIC), or their successor systems. On the basis of this data, HUD will assess and score the results, advise PHAs of their scores, and identify low-scoring and poor-performing projects and PHAs so that these projects and PHAs will receive the appropriate attention and assistance.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Small PHAs.</E> A PHA with fewer than 250 units that does not convert to asset management will be considered as one project by HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) HUD's s<E T="03">coring procedures</E> will be published from time to time in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for public comment.</P>

              <P>(2) At HUD's discretion, a standard performer may be required by the field office to submit and operate under a Corrective Action Plan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Substandard performer.</E> A PHA shall be designated a substandard performer if the PHA achieves a total PHAS score of at least 60 percent and achieves a score of less than 60 percent <PRTPAGE P="245"/>under one or more of the physical condition, financial condition, or management operations indicators. The PHA shall be designated as substandard physical, substandard financial, or substandard management, respectively.

              <P>The frequency of a PHA's PHAS assessments is determined by the size of the PHA's Low-Rent program and its PHAS designation. HUD may, due to unforeseen circumstances or other cause as determined by HUD, extend the time between assessments by direct notice to the PHA and relevant resident organization or resident management entity, and any other general notice that HUD deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Small PHAs.</E> HUD will assess and score the performance of a PHA with fewer than 250 public housing units, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A small PHA that is a high performer may receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;</P>
              <P>(2) A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer may receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and</P>
              <P>(3) All other small PHAs may receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with § 902.75.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Frequency of scoring for PHAs with 250 units or more.</E> (1) All PHAs, other than stated in paragraph (a) of this section, may be assessed on an annual basis.</P>
              <P>(2) The physical condition score for each project will determine the frequency of inspections of each project. For projects with a physical condition score of 90 points or higher, physical inspections will be conducted every 3 years at the project. For projects with a physical condition score of less than 90 points but at least 80 points, physical inspection will be conducted every 2 years at the project. The physical condition score of 80 points or higher will be carried over to the next assessment period and averaged with the other project physical condition score(s) for the next assessment year for an overall PHAS physical condition indicator score. For projects whose physical condition score for a project is less than 80 points, physical inspections will be conducted annually at the project.</P>
              <P>(3) If a PHA is designated as a troubled performer, all projects will receive a physical condition inspection regardless of the individual project physical condition score.</P>
              <P>(4) In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Financial submissions.</E> HUD shall not issue a PHAS score for the unaudited and audited financial information in the years that a PHA is not being assessed under PHAS. Although HUD shall not issue a PHAS score under such circumstances, a PHA shall comply with the requirements for submission of annual unaudited and audited financial statements in accordance with subpart C of this part and 24 CFR 5.801.</P>

All PHAs are required to provide HUD or its representative with access to its projects and to all units and appurtenances in order to permit physical inspections, monitoring reviews, and quality assurance reviews under this part. Access to the units shall be provided whether or not the resident is home or has installed additional locks for which the PHA did not obtain keys. In the event that the PHA fails to provide access as required by HUD or its representative, the PHA shall be given a physical condition score of zero for the project or projects involved. This score of zero shall be used to calculate the physical condition indicator score and the overall PHAS score.</P>

Mixed-finance projects will be subject to the physical condition inspections.</P>
              <P>(b) Pursuant to § 902.13(a), PHAs with less than 250 public housing units will receive a PHAS assessment, based on their PHAS designation, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A small PHA that is a high performer will receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;</P>
              <P>(2) A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer will receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and</P>
              <P>(3) All other small PHAs will receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with § 902.75.</P>
              <P>(c) In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline score to be established for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Physical inspection under the PHAS physical condition indicator.</E> (1) To achieve the objective of paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will provide for an independent physical inspection of a PHA's project(s) that includes, at a minimum, a statistically valid sample of the units in the PHA's projects, to determine the extent of compliance with the DSS/GR standard.</P>

              <P>(2) Only occupied units will be inspected as dwelling units (except units approved by HUD for nondwelling purposes, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> daycare or meeting rooms, which are inspected as common areas). Vacant units that are not under lease at the time of the physical inspection will not be inspected. The categories of vacant units not under lease that are exempted from physical inspection are as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Units undergoing vacant unit turnaround—vacant units that are in the routine process of turnover; <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the period between which one resident has vacated a unit and a new lease takes effect;</P>
              <P>(ii) Units undergoing rehabilitation—vacant units that have substantial rehabilitation needs already identified, and there is an approved implementation plan to address the identified rehabilitation needs and the plan is fully funded;</P>
              <P>(iii) Offline units—vacant units that have repair requirements such that the units cannot be occupied in a normal period of time (considered to be between 5 and 7 days) and which are not included under an approved rehabilitation plan.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Observed deficiencies.</E> During the physical inspection of a project, an inspector looks for deficiencies for each inspectable item within the inspectable areas, such as holes (deficiencies) in the walls (item) of a dwelling unit (area). The dwelling units inspected in a project are a randomly selected, statistically valid sample of the units in the project, excluding vacant units not under lease at the time of the physical inspection, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exigent health and safety (EHS) deficiencies and health and safety (H&amp;S) deficiencies.</E> (1) <E T="03">EHS deficiencies.</E> To ensure prompt correction of EHS deficiencies, before leaving the site the inspector gives the project representative a Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that calls for immediate attention or remedy. The project representative acknowledges receipt of the deficiency report by signature. The project or PHA shall correct, remedy, or act to abate all EHS deficiencies cited in the deficiency report within 24 contiguous hours of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form. In addition, the project or PHA must certify to HUD within 3 business days of the project representative's receipt of the Notification of Exigent and Fire Safety Hazards Observed form that all EHS deficiencies were corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate within 24 continuous hours.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">H&amp;S deficiencies.</E> The project or the PHA, or both, as appropriate, is required to expeditiously correct, remedy, or act to abate all H&amp;S deficiencies after receipt of the Physical Inspection Report.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance with civil rights/nondiscrimination requirements.</E> Elements <PRTPAGE P="248"/>related to accessibility will be reviewed during the physical inspection to determine possible indications of noncompliance with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). A PHA will not be scored on those elements. Any indication of possible noncompliance will be referred to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.</P>

              <P>(1) The circumstances described in this section are not the circumstances that may be addressed by the technical review process described in § 902.68. The circumstances addressed in this paragraph (a)(1) of this section may include inconsistencies between local code requirements and the HUD physical inspection protocol; conditions that are permitted by local variance or license or which are preexisting physical features that do not conform to, or are inconsistent with, HUD's physical condition protocol; or the project or PHA having been scored for elements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, mail boxes, resident-owned appliances, etc.) that it does not own and is not responsible for maintaining. To qualify for an adjustment on this basis, the project or PHA must have notified the proper authorities regarding the deficient element.</P>
              <P>(2) An adjustment due to these circumstances may be initiated by a project or PHA's notification to the applicable HUD field office, and such notification shall include appropriate proof of the reasons for the unusual or incorrect result. Projects and PHAs may submit the request for this adjustment either prior to or after the physical inspection has been concluded. If the request is made after the conclusion of the physical inspection, the request must be made within 45 days of issuance of the project's or PHA's physical condition score. Based on the recommendation of the applicable HUD office following its review of the project evidence or documentation submitted by the project or PHA, HUD may determine that a reinspection and/or rescoring of the project or PHA is necessary.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjustments for adverse conditions beyond the control of the PHA.</E> Under certain circumstances, HUD may determine that certain deficiencies that adversely and significantly affect the physical condition score of the project were caused by circumstances beyond the control of the PHA. The correction of these conditions, however, remains the responsibility of the PHA.</P>
              <P>(1) The circumstances addressed by this paragraph (b)(1) may include, but are not limited to, damage caused by third parties (such as a private entity or public entity undertaking work near a public housing project that results in damage to the project) or natural disasters. The circumstances addressed in this paragraph (b)(1) are not those addressed by the technical review process in § 902.68.</P>
              <P>(2) To adjust a physical condition score based on circumstances addressed in this paragraph, the PHA must submit a request to the applicable HUD field office requesting a reinspection or rescoring of the PHA's project(s) dependent on the severity of the deficiency. The request must be submitted within 45 days of the issuance of the physical condition score to the PHA. If the PHA is requesting a reinspection, the request must be accompanied by a certification that all deficiencies identified in the original report have been corrected. Based on the recommendation of the applicable HUD office following its review of the project's or PHA's evidence or documentation, HUD may determine that a reinspection and rescoring of the PHA's project(s) is necessary.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustments for modernization work in progress.</E> HUD may determine that occupied dwelling units or other areas of a PHA's project, which are subject <PRTPAGE P="249"/>to physical inspection under this subpart, and which are undergoing modernization work, require an adjustment to the physical condition score.</P>
              <P>(1) An occupied dwelling unit or other areas of a PHA's project undergoing modernization are subject to physical inspection; the unit(s) and other areas of the PHA's project are not exempt from physical inspection. All elements of the unit or of the other areas of the PHA's project that are subject to inspection and are not undergoing modernization at the time of the inspection (even if modernization is planned) will be subject to HUD's physical inspection protocol without adjustment. For those elements of the unit or of the project that are undergoing modernization, deficiencies will be noted in accordance with HUD's physical inspection protocol, but the project or PHA may request adjustment of the physical condition score as a result of modernization work in progress.</P>
              <P>(2) An adjustment due to modernization work in progress may be initiated by a project's or PHA's notification to the applicable HUD field office, and the notification shall include supporting documentation of the modernization work under way at the time of the physical inspection. A project or PHA may submit the request for this adjustment either prior to or after the physical inspection has been concluded. If the request is made after the conclusion of the physical inspection, the request must be made within 45 days of issuance of the physical condition score. Based on the recommendation of the applicable HUD office, HUD may determine that a reinspection and rescoring of the PHA's project(s) are necessary.</P>

              <P>(a) Following the physical inspection of each project and the computation of the score(s) under this subpart, the PHA receives a Physical Inspection Report. The Physical Inspection Report allows the PHA to see the points lost by inspectable area, and the impact on the score of the H&amp;S and EHS deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(1) If EHS items are identified in the report, the PHA shall have the opportunity to correct, remedy, or act to abate all EHS deficiencies and may request a reinspection.</P>
              <P>(2) The request for reinspection must be made within 45 days of the PHA's receipt of the Physical Inspection Report. The request for reinspection must be accompanied by the PHA's identification of the EHS deficiencies that have been corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate and by the PHA's certification that all such deficiencies identified in the report have been corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate.</P>
              <P>(3) If HUD determines that a reinspection is appropriate, it will arrange for a complete reinspection of the project(s) in question, not just the deficiencies previously identified. The reinspection will constitute the final physical inspection for the project, and HUD will issue a new inspection report (the final inspection report).</P>

              <P>(4) If any of the previously identified EHS deficiencies that the PHA certified were corrected, remedied, or <PRTPAGE P="250"/>acted upon to abate are found during the reinspection not to have been corrected, remedied, or acted upon to abate, the score in the final inspection report will reflect a point deduction of triple the value of the original deduction, up to the maximum possible points for the unit or area, and the PHA must reimburse HUD for the cost of the reinspection.</P>
              <P>(5) If a request for reinspection is not made within 45 days after the date that the PHA receives the Physical Inspection Report, the Physical Inspection Report issued to the PHA will be the final Physical Inspection Report.</P>
              <P>(b) A Physical Inspection Report includes the following items:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Financial condition scoring and thresholds.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scoring.</E> (1) Under the financial condition indicator, a score will be calculated for each project based on the <PRTPAGE P="251"/>values of financial condition subindicators and an overall financial condition score, as well as audit and internal control flags. Each financial condition subindicator has several levels of performance, with different point values for each level.</P>
              <P>(2) The financial condition score for projects will be based on the annual financial condition information submitted to HUD for each project under 24 CFR 990.280 and 990.285. The financial condition score for PHAs will be based on a unit-weighted average of project scores.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subindicators of the financial condition indicator.</E> The subindicators of financial condition indicator are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Quick Ratio (QR).</E> The QR compares quick assets to current liabilities. Quick assets are cash and assets that are easily convertible to cash and do not include inventory. Current liabilities are those liabilities that are due within the next 12 months. A QR of less than one indicates that the project's ability to make payments on a timely basis may be at risk.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Months Expendable Net Assets Ratio (MENAR).</E> The MENAR measures a project's ability to operate using its net available, unrestricted resources without relying on additional funding. This ratio compares the adjusted net available unrestricted resources to the average monthly operating expenses. The result of this calculation shows how many months of operating expenses can be covered with currently available, unrestricted resources.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).</E> The DSCR is the ratio of net operating income available to make debt payments, to the amount of the debt payments. This subindicator is used if the PHA has taken on long-term obligations. A DSCR of less than one would indicate that the project would have difficulty generating sufficient cash flow to cover both its expenses and its debt obligations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Overall PHA financial condition indicator score.</E> The overall financial condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is then divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall financial condition indicator score.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Thresholds.</E> (1) The PHA's financial condition score is based on a maximum of 25 points.</P>
              <P>(2) In order for a PHA to receive a passing score under the financial condition indicator, the PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points, or 60 percent of the available points under this indicator.</P>
              <P>(3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points available under this indicator will be categorized as a substandard financial condition agency.</P>

These situations are related to the poor physical condition of the project or the overall depressed condition of the major census tract in which a project is located. The intent of this adjustment is to avoid penalizing such projects, through appropriate application of the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> Definitions and application of physical condition and neighborhood environment factors are:</P>
              <P>(1) Physical condition adjustment applies to projects at least 28 years old, based on the unit-weighted average Date of Full Availability (DOFA) date.</P>
              <P>(2) Neighborhood environment adjustment applies to projects located in census tracts where at least 40 percent of the families have an income below the poverty rate, as documented by the most recent census data. If a project is located in more than one census tract, the census data for the census tract where the majority of the project's units are located shall be used.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment.</E> HUD will adjust the management operations score of a project, subject to one or both of the physical condition and neighborhood environment conditions. The adjustments will be made to the overall management operations score for each project so as to reflect the difficulty in managing the projects. In each instance where the actual management operations score is rated below the maximum score of 25 points, one point each will be added for physical condition and neighborhood environment, but not to exceed the maximum number of 25 points available for the management operations indicator.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Application of adjustment.</E> The adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment will be calculated by HUD and applied to all eligible projects.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Failure to submit data by due date.</E> (1) If a PHA without a finding of good cause by HUD does not submit its year-end financial information, required by this part, or submits its unaudited year-end financial information more than 15 days past the due date, appropriate sanctions may be imposed, including a reduction of one point in the total PHAS score for each 15-day period past the due date.</P>
              <P>(2) If the unaudited year-end financial information is not received within 3 months past the due date, or extended due date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for its unaudited information and shall receive zero points for its unaudited financial information and the final financial condition indicator score. The subsequent timely submission of audited information does not negate the score of zero received for the unaudited year-end financial information submission.</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA's audited financial statement must be received no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year-end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. If the audited financial statement is not received by that date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for the financial condition indicator.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Verification of information submitted.</E> (1) A PHA's year-end financial information and any supporting documentation are subject to review by an independent auditor, as authorized by section 6(j)(6) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(j)(6)). Appropriate sanctions for intentional false certification will be imposed, including civil penalties, suspension or debarment of the signatories, the loss of high performer designation, a lower score under the financial condition indicator, and a lower overall PHAS score.</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA that cannot provide justifying documentation to HUD for the assessment under any indicator(s) or subindicator(s) shall receive a score of zero for the relevant indicator(s) or subindicator(s) and its overall PHAS score shall be lowered accordingly.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Failure to submit.</E> If a PHA does not submit its unaudited or audited information, it will receive a zero for management operations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>PHAS scoring and audit reviews.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Adjustments to PHAS score.</E> (1) Adjustments to the score may be made after a PHA's audit report for the fiscal year being assessed is transmitted to HUD. If significant differences are noted between unaudited and audited results, a PHA's PHAS score will be adjusted in accordance with the audited results.</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA's PHAS score under individual indicators or subindicators, or its overall PHAS score, may be changed by HUD in accordance with data included in the audit report or obtained through such sources as HUD project management and other reviews, investigations by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, investigations or audits by HUD's Office of Inspector General, or reinspection by HUD, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Issuance of a score by HUD.</E> (1) An overall PHAS score will be issued for each PHA after the later of one month after the submission due date for financial data or one month after submission by the PHA of its financial data. The overall PHAS score becomes the <PRTPAGE P="255"/>PHA's final PHAS score after any adjustments requested by the PHA and determined necessary under the processes provided in §§ 902.25(d), 902.35(a), and 902.68; any adjustments resulting from the appeal process provided in § 902.69; and any adjustments determined necessary as a result of the independent public accountant (IPA) audit.</P>
              <P>(2) Each PHA (or RMC) shall post a notice of its final PHAS score and designation in appropriate conspicuous and accessible locations in its offices within 2 weeks of receipt of its final PHAS score and designation. In addition, HUD will post every PHA's PHAS score and designation on HUD's Internet site.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Review of audit.</E> (1) <E T="03">Quality control review.</E> HUD may undertake a quality control review of the audit work papers or as part of the Department's ongoing quality assurance process.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of deficiency.</E> If HUD determines that the PHA's financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, it shall notify the PHA of such determination in writing. The PHA will have 30 days in which to respond to the notice of deficiency and to establish that the determination is erroneous. Following consideration of any PHA response, HUD will issue a final determination in writing to the PHA.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Deficient financial statements.</E> Deficient financial statements are statements that are not presented, in some material respect, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board, or if applicable, the Financial Accounting Standards Board.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Deficient electronic submission.</E> A deficient electronic financial submission is a filing that was not made, in some material respect, in accordance with HUD requirements or attested to in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Deficient audit.</E> A deficient audit is one that was not performed, in some material respect, in compliance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards; Generally Accepted Auditing Standards; the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, when applicable; or HUD requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">HUD actions.</E> If HUD determines that the financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, HUD may adjust the financial indicator score to zero and/or reduce the overall PHAS score in accordance with the provisions of this section. Additionally, if HUD determines that the audit is deficient, HUD may, at its discretion, elect to serve as the audit committee for the PHA for the next fiscal year and select the audit firm that will perform the audit in question.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Withholding, denying, and rescinding designation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Withholding designation.</E> In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied all of the PHAS indicators for high performer or standard performer designation, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or standard performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:</P>
              <P>(1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a civil rights compliance agreement);</P>
              <P>(2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical, financial, or management performance of a PHA;</P>
              <P>(3) Is operating under a court order;</P>
              <P>(4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or</P>

              <P>(5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under PHAS. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, <PRTPAGE P="256"/>or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with federal laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">High performer and standard designations.</E> If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a standard performer, substandard performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a standard performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a substandard performer or troubled performer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect on score.</E> The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or standard performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical PHAS score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Technical review of results of PHAS physical condition indicator.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Request for technical reviews.</E> This section describes the process for requesting and granting technical reviews of physical inspection results.</P>
              <P>(1) For these reviews, the burden of proof is on the PHA to show that an error occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for technical review must be submitted in writing to the Real Estate Assessment Center, Attention: TAC—Technical Review, 550 12th Street, SW., Suite 100, Washington, DC 20410 and must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the applicable results to the PHA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Technical review of results of physical inspection results.</E> (1) For each project inspected, the results of the physical inspection and a score for that project will be provided to the PHA. If the PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) occurred in the inspection of an individual project, the PHA may request a technical review of the inspection results for that project. Material errors are the only grounds for technical review of physical inspection results.</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA's request for a technical review must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) has occurred. The documentation submitted by the PHA may be photographic evidence; written material from an objective source, such as a local fire marshal or building code official or a licensed or registered architect or professional engineer with the authority to sign and seal or “stamp” documents, thus taking the legal responsibility for them, or other similar evidence that is specific to the inspectable area and item being challenged. The evidence must be more than a disagreement with the inspector's observations, or the inspector's finding regarding the severity of the deficiency.</P>

              <P>(3) A technical review of a project's physical inspection will not be conducted based on conditions that were corrected subsequent to the inspection, nor will a request for a technical review be considered if the request is based on a challenge to the inspector's findings as to the severity of the deficiency (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> minor, major, or severe).</P>
              <P>(4) Upon receipt of a PHA's request for technical review of a project's inspection results, the PHA's file will be reviewed, including any objectively verifiable evidence produced by the PHA. If HUD's review determines that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) has been documented, then one or a combination of the following actions may be taken by HUD:</P>
              <P>(i) Undertake a new inspection;</P>
              <P>(ii) Correct the physical inspection report;</P>
              <P>(iii) Issue a corrected physical condition score; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Issue a corrected PHAS score.</P>

              <P>(5) In determining whether a new inspection of the project is warranted and a new PHAS score must be issued, the PHA's file will be reviewed, including any evidence submitted, to determine whether the evidence supports that there may have been a material contractor error in the inspection that results in a significant change from the project's original physical condition score and the PHAS designation assigned to the PHA (i.e., high performer, standard performer, substandard performer, or troubled performer). If HUD <PRTPAGE P="257"/>determines that a new inspection is warranted, and the new inspection results in a significant change from the original physical condition score, and from the PHA's PHAS score and PHAS designation, the PHA shall be issued a new PHAS score.</P>
              <P>(6) Material errors are those that exhibit specific characteristics and meet specific thresholds. The three types of material errors are:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Building data error.</E> A building data error occurs if the inspection includes the wrong building or a building that was not owned by the PHA, including common or site areas that were not a part of the project. Incorrect building data that does not affect the score, such as the address, building name, year built, etc., would not be considered material, but will nonetheless be corrected upon notice to HUD.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Unit count error.</E> A unit count error occurs if the total number of public housing units considered in scoring is incorrect. Since scoring uses total public housing units, HUD will examine instances where the participant can provide evidence that the total units used is incorrect.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Nonexistent deficiency error.</E> A nonexistent deficiency error occurs if the inspection cites a deficiency that does not exist.</P>
              <P>(7) HUD's decision on a request for technical review is final and may not be further appealed under the administrative process in § 902.69.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Appeal of troubled performer designation and petition for removal of troubled performer designation.</E> A PHA may take any of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(1) Appeal its troubled performer designation (including Capital Fund program troubled performer designation);</P>
              <P>(2) Appeal its final overall PHAS score;</P>
              <P>(3) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation;</P>
              <P>(4) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation; and</P>
              <P>(5) Appeal actions under § 902.66.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Appeal of PHAS score.</E> (1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in any of the scores for its PHAS indicators, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's PHAS score and its designation (i.e., as troubled performer, substandard performer, standard performer, or high performer), the PHA may appeal its PHAS score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. A significant change in a PHAS score is a change that would cause the PHA's PHAS score to increase, resulting in a higher PHAS designation for the PHA (i.e., from troubled performer to substandard performer or standard performer, or from standard performer to high performer).</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, physical condition score, or both, based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection or the denial of a technical review request.</P>
              <P>(3) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS by the submission due date.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeal and petition procedures.</E> (1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or a final overall PHAS score, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the overall PHAS score to the PHA. To petition the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.</P>
              <P>(2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.</P>

              <P>(3) To appeal the petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, or appeal the denial of a petition <PRTPAGE P="258"/>to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA shall submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.</P>
              <P>(4) An appeal of a troubled performer designation, the petition for removal of a troubled performer designation, or the appeal of a refusal of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of a PHAS score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Denial, withholding, or rescission.</E> A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under § 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Consideration of petitions and appeals.</E> (1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall PHAS score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.</P>
              <P>(2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice and finality of decisions.</E> (1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, arrange for audit services, adjust the PHA's score, or perform other reexamination of the financial, management, or Capital Fund program information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's decision on appeal of a PHAS score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Bonus points in funding competitions.</E> A high performer PHA may be eligible for bonus points in HUD's funding competitions, where such bonus points are not restricted by statute or regulation governing the funding program and are provided in the relevant notice of funding availability.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations.</E> Relief from any standard procedural requirement that may be provided under this section does not mean that a PHA is relieved from compliance with the provisions of federal law and regulations or other handbook requirements. For example, although a high performer or standard performer may be relieved of requirements for prior HUD approval for certain types of contracts for services, the PHA must still comply with all other federal and state requirements that remain in effect, such as those for competitive bidding or competitive negotiation (see 2 CFR 200.319, as applicable).</P>

              <P>(1) Baseline data, which should be data without adjustments or weighting but may be the PHA's score in each of the PHAS indicators or subindicators identified as a deficiency;</P>

              <P>(2) Performance targets for such periods specified by HUD (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly), which may be the attainment of a higher score within an indicator or subindicator that is a problem, or the description of a goal to be achieved;</P>
              <P>(3) Strategies to be used by the PHA in achieving the performance targets within the time period of the MOA, including the identification of the party responsible for the completion of each task and for reporting progress;</P>
              <P>(4) Technical assistance to the PHA provided or facilitated by HUD; for example, the training of PHA employees in specific management areas or assistance in the resolution of outstanding HUD monitoring findings;</P>
              <P>(5) The PHA's commitment to take all actions within its control to achieve the targets;</P>
              <P>(6) Incentives for meeting such targets, such as the removal of a troubled performer designation or troubled with respect to the program for assistance from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) and HUD recognition for the most-improved PHAs;</P>
              <P>(7) The consequences of failing to meet the targets, which include, but are not limited to, the interventions stated in 24 CFR part 907 and in section 6(j)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)); and</P>
              <P>(8) A description of the involvement of local public and private entities, including PHA resident leaders, in carrying out the agreement and rectifying the PHA's problems. A PHA shall have primary responsibility for obtaining active local public and private entity participation, including the involvement of public housing resident leaders, in assisting PHA improvement efforts. Local public and private entity participation should be premised upon the participant's knowledge of the PHA, ability to contribute technical expertise with regard to the PHA's specific problem areas, and authority to make preliminary commitments of support, financial or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PHA review of MOA.</E> The PHA will have 10 days to review the MOA. During this 10-day period, the PHA shall resolve any claimed discrepancies in the MOA with HUD, and discuss any recommended changes and target dates for improvement to be incorporated in <PRTPAGE P="261"/>the final MOA. Unless the time period is extended by HUD, the MOA is to be executed 15 days following issuance of the draft MOA.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Maximum recovery period.</E> (1) <E T="03">Expiration of the first-year improvement period.</E> Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA receives initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 12 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance by at least 50 percent of the difference between the initial PHAS assessment score that led to the troubled performer status and the score necessary to remove the PHA's designation as a troubled performer.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Expiration of 2-year recovery period.</E> Upon the expiration of the 2-year period that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 24 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance and achieve an overall PHAS score of at least 60 percent of the total points available.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Parties to the MOA.</E> An MOA shall be executed by:</P>
              <P>(1) The PHA Board Chairperson (supported by a Board resolution), or a receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable) or other AME acting in lieu of the PHA Board;</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA Executive Director, or a designated receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable), or other AME-designated Chief Executive Officer; and</P>
              <P>(3) The field office</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Involvement of resident leadership in the MOA.</E> HUD encourages the inclusion of the resident leadership in the execution of the MOA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Failure to execute MOA or make substantial improvement under MOA.</E> (1) If a troubled performer PHA fails or refuses to execute an MOA within the period provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or a troubled performer PHA operating under an executed MOA does not show a substantial improvement, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, toward a passing PHAS score following the issuance of the failing PHAS score by HUD, the field office shall refer the PHA to the Assistant Secretary to determine such remedial actions, consistent with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, remedies available for substantial default.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, substantial improvement is defined as the improvement required by paragraph (d) of this section. The maximum period of time for remaining in troubled performer status before being referred to the Assistant Secretary is 2 years after the initial notification of the troubled performer designation. Therefore, the PHA must make substantial improvement in each year of this 2-year period.</P>

              <P>(3) The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section:
              </P>
              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example:</HD>
                <P>A PHA receives a score of 50 points on the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators; 60 points is a passing score. Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled performer designation, the PHA must achieve at least 55 points (50 percent of the 10 points necessary to achieve a passing score of 60 points) to continue recovery efforts. In the second year, the PHA must achieve a minimum score of 60 points (a passing score). If, in the first year that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled designation, the PHA fails to achieve the 5-point increase, or if the PHA achieves the 5 point increase within the first year that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled designation, but fails to achieve the minimum passing score of 60 points after the second year after the initial notification, HUD will notify the PHA that it will take such actions as it may determine appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, the remedies available for substantial default.</P>
              </EXAMPLE>
              
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Audit review.</E> For a PHA designated as a troubled performer, HUD may perform an audit review and may, at its discretion, select the audit firm that will perform the audit of the PHA; and HUD may, at its discretion, serve as the audit committee for the audit in question.<PRTPAGE P="262"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Continuation of services to residents.</E> To the extent feasible, while a PHA is in a troubled performer status, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.</P>

              <P>All project and PHA certifications, year-end financial information, and supporting documentation are subject to HUD verification at any time, including review by an independent auditor. All PHAs must retain supporting documents for any certifications and for asset management reviews for at least 3 years. Failure to maintain and provide supporting documentation for a period of 3 years for any indicator(s), subindicator(s), or other methods used to assess performance shall result in a score of zero for the indicator(s) or subindicator(s), and a lower overall PHAS score for the applicable assessment period.</P>

              <P>Residents of a PHA designated as troubled pursuant to section 6(j)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(A)) may petition HUD in writing to take one or more of the actions referred to in section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)). HUD will consider any petition from a group of residents totaling at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents, or from an organization or organizations of residents whose membership equals at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents. HUD shall respond to such petitions in a timely manner with a written description of the actions, if any, HUD plans to take and, where applicable, the reasons why such actions differ from the course proposed by the residents. Nothing in this section shall limit HUD's discretion to determine whether a substantial default has occurred or to select the appropriate intervention upon such determination.</P>

              <P>(a) If a troubled performer PHA fails to make substantial improvement, as set forth in § 902.75(d), HUD shall:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with 1,250 or more units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)); or</P>
              <P>(2) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with fewer than 1,250 units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and either petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)), or take possession of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA) pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(iv)), and appoint, on a competitive or noncompetitive basis, an individual or entity as an administrative receiver to assume the responsibilities of HUD for the administration of all or part of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA).</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of substantial default by a troubled performer PHA, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the courses of action available to HUD under this part, 24 CFR part 907, or section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)) for any other substantial default by a PHA.</P>
              <P>(b) If a troubled performer PHA fails to execute or meet the requirements of an MOA in accordance with § 902.75, other than as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may be deemed to be in substantial default by HUD and any remedy available therefore may be invoked in the discretion of HUD.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to specify the process which a Public Housing Agency, as part of its annual planning process and development of an admissions policy, must follow in order to develop and apply a policy that provides for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in certain public housing developments.</P>

              <SUBJECT>With respect to admissions, what must a PHA do to deconcentrate poverty in its developments?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The PHA's admission policy includes the PHA's policy designed to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in accordance with section 16(a)(3)(B) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437n), which is submitted to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan process. Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing is promoted by a policy that provides for bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and lower income tenants into higher income developments.</P>
              <P>(1) The provisions of this section apply to applicants to and residents seeking voluntary transfers within covered public housing developments (“covered developments” as specified in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) The statutory requirement to design a policy to provide for deconcentration and income mixing is not to be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements</E>—(1) <E T="03">Developments subject to deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements.</E> The deconcentration requirements of this subpart apply to general occupancy, family public housing developments, excluding those developments listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Developments to which this subpart is applicable are referred to as “covered developments”.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Developments not subject to deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements.</E> This subpart does not apply to the following public housing developments:</P>
              <P>(i) Public housing developments operated by a PHA with fewer than 100 public housing units;</P>
              <P>(ii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which house only elderly persons or persons with disabilities, or both;</P>
              <P>(iii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which consist of only one general occupancy, family public housing development;</P>
              <P>(iv) Public housing developments approved for demolition or for conversion to tenant-based assistance; and</P>

              <P>(v) Public housing developments which include public housing units operated in accordance with a HUD-approved mixed-finance plan using HOPE <PRTPAGE P="264"/>VI or public housing funds awarded before the effective date of this rule, provided that the PHA certifies (and includes reasons for the certification) as part of its PHA Plan (which may be accomplished either in the annual Plan submission or as a significant amendment to its PHA Plan) that exemption from the regulation is necessary to honor an existing contractual agreement or be consistent with a mixed finance plan, including provisions regarding the incomes of public housing residents to be admitted to that development, which has been developed in consultation with residents with rights to live at the affected development and other interested persons.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Steps for implementation.</E> To implement the statutory requirement to deconcentrate poverty and provide for income mixing in covered public housing developments, a PHA must comply with the following steps:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Step 1.</E> A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in all the PHA's covered developments. A PHA may use median income, instead of average income, provided that the PHA includes a written explanation in its PHA Annual Plan justifying use of median income in the PHA's Annual Plan.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Step 2.</E> A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in each covered development. In determining average income for each development, a PHA has the option of adjusting its income analysis for unit size in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Step 3.</E> A PHA shall determine whether each of its covered developments falls above, within or below the Established Income Range. The Established Income Range is from 85 to 115 percent (inclusive) of the average family income (the PHA-wide average income for covered developments as defined in Step 1), except that the upper limit shall never be less than the income at which a family would be defined as an extremely low income family under 24 CFR 5.603(b).</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Step 4.</E> A PHA with covered developments having average incomes outside the Established Income Range may explain or justify the income profile for these developments as being consistent with and furthering two sets of goals: the goals of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing as specified by the statute (bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and vice versa); and the local goals and strategies contained in the PHA Annual Plan. Elements of explanations or justifications that may satisfy these requirements may include, but shall not be limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(A) The covered development or developments are subject to consent decrees or other resident selection and admission plans mandated by court action;</P>
              <P>(B) The covered development or developments are part of PHA's programs, strategies or activities specifically authorized by statute, such as mixed-income or mixed-finance developments, homeownership programs, self-sufficiency strategies, or other strategies designed to deconcentrate poverty, promote income mixing in public housing, increase the incomes of public housing residents, or the income mix is otherwise subject to individual review and approval by HUD;</P>
              <P>(C) The covered development's or developments' size, location, and/or configuration promote income deconcentration, such as scattered site or small developments;</P>
              <P>(D) The income characteristics of the covered development or developments are sufficiently explained by other circumstances.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Step 5.</E> Where the income profile for a covered development is not explained or justified in the PHA Annual Plan submission, the PHA shall include in its admission policy its specific policy to provide for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in applicable covered developments. Depending on local circumstances, a PHA's deconcentration policy (which may be undertaken in conjunction with other efforts such as efforts to increase self-sufficiency or current residents) may include but is not limited to providing for one or more of the following actions:</P>

              <P>(A) Providing incentives designed to encourage families with incomes below <PRTPAGE P="265"/>the Established Income Range to accept units in developments with incomes above the Established Income Range, or vice versa, including rent incentives, affirmative marketing plans, or added amenities;</P>
              <P>(B) Targeting investment and capital improvements toward developments with an average income below the Established Income Range to encourage applicant families whose income is above the Established Income Range to accept units in those developments;</P>
              <P>(C) Establishing a preference for admission of working families in developments below the Established Income Range;</P>
              <P>(D) Skipping a family on the waiting list to reach another family in an effort to further the goals of the PHA's deconcentration policy;</P>
              <P>(E) Providing such other strategies as permitted by statute and determined by the PHA in consultation with the residents and the community, through the PHA Annual Plan process, to be responsive to the local context and the PHA's strategic objectives.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of compliance with deconcentration requirement.</E> HUD shall consider a PHA to be in compliance with this subpart if:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA's income analysis shows that the PHA has no general occupancy family developments to which the deconcentration requirements apply; that is, the average incomes of all covered developments are within the Established Income Range;</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA has covered developments with average incomes above or below the Established Income Range and the PHA provides a sufficient explanation in its Annual Plan that supports that the income mix of such development or developments is consistent with and furthers the goal of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing and also the locally determined goals of the PHA's Annual and Five Year Plans, and the PHA therefore need not take further action to deconcentrate poverty and mix incomes; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA's deconcentration policy provides specific strategies the PHA will take that can be expected to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in developments with average incomes outside of the Established Income Range.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Right of return.</E> If a PHA has provided that a family that resided in a covered public housing development has a right to admission to a public housing unit in that development after revitalization, the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not preclude fulfilling that commitment or a PHA's commitment to return a family to another development after revitalization.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Family's discretion to refuse a unit.</E> A family has the sole discretion whether to accept an offer of a unit made under a PHA's deconcentration policy. The PHA may not take any adverse action toward any eligible family for choosing not to accept an offer of a unit under the PHA's deconcentration policy. In accordance with the PHA's established policies, the PHA may uniformly limit the number of offers received by applicants.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Relationship to income targeting requirement.</E> Nothing in this section relieves a PHA of the obligation to meet the requirement to admit annually at least 40 percent families whose incomes are below 30 percent of area median income as provided by section 16(a)(2) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437n(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Relationship between poverty deconcentration and fair housing.</E> The requirements for poverty deconcentration in paragraph (c) of this section and for fair housing in 24 CFR 903.15(d) arise under separate statutory authorities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the purpose of this subpart?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart specifies the requirements for PHA plans, required by section 5A of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437c-1) (the Act), as amended.</P>
              <P>(b) The purpose of the plans is to provide a strategic planning framework for PHA management operations and capital planning:</P>
              <P>(1) Local accountability; and<PRTPAGE P="266"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) An easily identifiable source by which public housing residents, participants in the tenant-based assistance program, and other members of the public may locate basic PHA policies, rules and requirements concerning the PHA's operations, programs and services.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the public housing agency plans?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Types of plans.</E> There are two public housing agency plans. They are:</P>
              <P>(1) The 5-Year Plan (the 5-Year Plan) that a public housing agency (PHA) must submit to HUD once every five PHA fiscal years. The 5-Year Plan covers the five PHA fiscal years immediately following the date on which the 5-Year Plan is due to HUD; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Annual Plan (Annual Plan) that the PHA must submit to HUD for each fiscal year immediately following the date on which the Annual Plan is due to HUD and for which the PHA receives:</P>
              <P>(i) Section 8 tenant-based assistance (under section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) (tenant-based assistance); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Amounts from the public housing operating fund or capital fund (under section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g) (public housing)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Format.</E> HUD may prescribe the format of submission (including electronic format submission) of the plans. HUD also may prescribe the format of attachments to the plans and documents related to the plan that the PHA does not submit but may be required to make available locally. PHAs will receive appropriate notice of any prescribed format.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The requirements of this subpart only apply to a PHA that receives the type of assistance described in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Authority for waivers.</E> In addition to the waiver authority provided in § 5.110 of this title, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this title on a program-wide basis, and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)) where the Secretary determines that such waiver is necessary for the effective implementation of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>When must a PHA submit the plans to HUD?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">5-Year Plan.</E> (1) The first PHA fiscal year that is covered by the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000, is the PHA fiscal year that begins October 2001. This 5-Year Plan submitted by a PHA must be submitted for the 5-year period beginning October 1, 2001.</P>
              <P>(2) For all PHAs, the first 5-Year Plans are due 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) For all PHAs, after submission of their first 5-Year Plan, all subsequent 5-Year Plans must be submitted once every 5 PHA fiscal years, no later than 75 days before the commencement of the PHA's fiscal year. However, HUD may require that half of all PHAs with less than 250 public housing units submit their 5-Year Plan one fiscal year in advance (in the fourth PHA fiscal year rather than the fifth PHA fiscal year).</P>

              <P>(4) PHAs may choose to update their 5-Year Plans every year as good management practice and must update their 5-Year Plans that were submitted for PHA fiscal years beginning before October 1, 2001, to comply with the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000, at the time they submit their next Annual Plan for fiscal years beginning on or after October <PRTPAGE P="267"/>1, 2001. PHAs must explain any substantial deviation from their 5-Year Plans in their Annual Plans. (Substantial deviation is determined by the PHA in accordance with criteria provided by the PHA in its Annual Plan in accordance with § 903.7(r).)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The Annual Plan.</E> (1) The first PHA fiscal year that is covered by the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000 is the PHA fiscal year that begins October 1, 2001.</P>
              <P>(2) For all PHAs, the first Annual Plans are due 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(3) For all PHAs, after submission of the first Annual Plan, all subsequent Annual Plans will be due no later than 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.</P>

For HUD, the PHA and the public to better measure the success of the PHA in meeting its goals and objectives, the PHA must adopt quantifiable goals and objectives for serving those needs wherever possible.</P>
              <P>(3) A statement about goals, activities, objectives, policies, or programs that will enable a PHA to serve the needs of child and adult victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What information must a PHA provide in the Annual Plan?</SUBJECT>
              <P>With the exception of the first Annual Plan submitted by a PHA, the Annual Plan must include the information provided in this section. HUD will advise PHAs by separate notice, sufficiently in advance of the first Annual Plan due date, of the information, described in this section that must be part of the first Annual Plan submission, and any additional instructions or directions that may be necessary to prepare and submit the first Annual Plan. The information described in this section applies to both public housing and tenant-based assistance, except where specifically stated otherwise. The information that the PHA must submit for HUD approval under the Annual Plan includes the discretionary policies of the various plan components or elements (for example, rent policies) and not the statutory or regulatory requirements that govern these plan components and that provide no discretion on the part of the PHA in implementation of the requirements. The PHA's Annual Plan must be consistent with the goals and objectives of the PHA's 5-Year Plan.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">A statement of housing needs.</E> (1) This statement must address the housing needs of the low-income and very low-income families who reside in the jurisdiction served by the PHA, and other families who are on the public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance waiting lists, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Families meeting the definition of extremely low-income families in 24 CFR 5.603.</P>
              <P>(ii) Elderly families;</P>
              <P>(iii) Until the PHA has submitted an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH), which includes an assessment of disproportionate housing needs in accordance with 24 CFR 5.154(d)(2)(iv), households with individuals with disabilities and households of various races and ethnic groups residing in the jurisdiction or on the waiting list. Once the PHA has submitted an AFH, however, such households need not be addressed in this statement.</P>

              <P>(2) A PHA must make reasonable efforts to identify the housing needs of each of the groups listed in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="268"/>(a)(1) of this section based on information provided by the applicable consolidated plan, information provided by HUD, and other generally available data.</P>
              <P>(i) The identification of housing needs must address issues of affordability, supply, quality, accessibility, size of units, and location.</P>
              <P>(ii) The statement of housing needs also must describe the ways in which the PHA intends, to the maximum extent practicable, to address those needs and the PHA's reasons for choosing its strategy.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">A statement of the PHA's deconcentration and other policies that govern eligibility, selection, and admissions.</E> This statement must describe the PHA's policies that govern resident or tenant eligibility, selection and admission. This statement also must describe any PHA admission preferences, and any occupancy policies that pertain to public housing units and housing units assisted under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act, as well as any unit assignment policies for public housing. This statement must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Deconcentration Policy.</E> The PHA's deconcentration policy applicable to public housing, as described in § 903.2(a).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Waiting List Procedures.</E> The PHA's procedures for maintaining waiting lists for admission to the PHA's public housing developments. The statement must address any site-based waiting lists, as authorized by section 6(s) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(s)), for public housing. Section 6(s) of the 1937 Act permits PHAs to establish a system of site-based waiting lists for public housing that is consistent with all applicable civil rights and fair housing laws and regulations. Notwithstanding any other regulations, a PHA may adopt site-based waiting lists where:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA regularly submits required occupancy data to HUD's Multifamily Tenant Characteristics Systems (MTCS) in an accurate, complete and timely manner;</P>
              <P>(ii) The system of site-based waiting lists provides for full disclosure to each applicant of any option available to the applicant in the selection of the development in which to reside, including basic information about available sites (location, occupancy, number and size of accessible units, amenities such as day care, security, transportation and training programs) and an estimate of the period of time the applicant would likely have to wait to be admitted to units of different sizes and types (e.g., regular or accessible) at each site;</P>
              <P>(iii) Adoption of site-based waiting lists would not violate any court order or settlement agreement, or be inconsistent with a pending complaint brought by HUD;</P>
              <P>(iv) The PHA includes reasonable measures to assure that adoption of site-based waiting lists is consistent with affirmatively furthering fair housing, such as reasonable marketing activities to attract applicants regardless of race or ethnicity;</P>
              <P>(v) The PHA provides for review of its site-based waiting list policy to determine if the policy is consistent with civil rights laws and certifications through the following steps:</P>
              <P>(A) As part of the submission of the Annual Plan, the PHA shall assess changes in racial, ethnic or disability-related tenant composition at each PHA site that may have occurred during the implementation of the site-based waiting list, based upon MTCS occupancy data that has been confirmed to be complete and accurate by an independent audit (which may be the annual independent audit) or is otherwise satisfactory to HUD;</P>
              <P>(B) At least every three years the PHA uses independent testers or other means satisfactory to HUD, to assure that the site-based waiting list is not being implemented in a discriminatory manner, and that no patterns or practices of discrimination exist, and providing the results to HUD;</P>
              <P>(C) Taking any steps necessary to remedy the problems surfaced during the review; and</P>
              <P>(D) Taking the steps necessary to affirmatively further fair housing.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other admissions policies.</E> The PHA's admission policies that include any other PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admissions for the public housing (see part 960 of this title) and tenant-based assistance programs (see part 982, subpart E of this title). (The information requested on <PRTPAGE P="269"/>site-based waiting lists and deconcentration is applicable only to public housing.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">A statement of financial resources.</E> This statement must address the financial resources that are available to the PHA for the support of Federal public housing and tenant-based assistance programs administered by the PHA during the plan year. The statement must include a listing, by general categories, of the PHA's anticipated resources, such as PHA operating, capital and other anticipated Federal resources available to the PHA, as well as tenant rents and other income available to support public housing or tenant-based assistance. The statement also should include the non-Federal sources of funds supporting each Federal program, and state the planned uses for the resources.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">A statement of the PHA's rent determination policies.</E> This statement must describe the PHA's basic discretionary policies that govern rents charged for public housing units, applicable flat rents, and the rental contributions of families receiving tenant-based assistance. For tenant-based assistance, this statement also shall cover any discretionary minimum tenant rents and payment standard policies.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">A statement of the PHA's operation and management.</E> (1) This statement must list the PHA's rules, standards, and policies that govern maintenance and management of housing owned, assisted, or operated by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(2) The policies listed in this statement must include a description of any measures necessary for the prevention or eradication of pest infestation. Pest infestation includes cockroach infestation.</P>
              <P>(3) This statement must include a description of PHA management organization, and a listing of the programs administered by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(4) The information requested on a PHA's rules, standards and policies regarding management and maintenance of housing applies only to public housing. The information requested on PHA program management and listing of administered programs applies to public housing and tenant-based assistance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">A statement of the PHA grievance procedures.</E> This statement describes the grievance and informal hearing and review procedures that the PHA makes available to its residents and applicants. These procedures include public housing grievance procedures and tenant-based assistance informal review procedures for applicants and hearing procedures for participants.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">A statement of capital improvements needed.</E> With respect to public housing only, this statement describes the capital improvements necessary to ensure long-term physical and social viability of the PHA's public housing developments, including the capital improvements to be undertaken in the year in question and their estimated costs, and any other information required for participation in the Capital Fund. PHAs also are required to include 5-Year Plans covering large capital items.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">A statement of any demolition and/or disposition</E>—(1) <E T="03">Plan for Demolition/Disposition.</E> With respect to public housing only, a description of any public housing development, or portion of a public housing development, owned by the PHA for which the PHA has applied or will apply for demolition and/or disposition approval under section 18 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p), and the timetable for demolition and/or disposition. The application and approval process for demolition and/or disposition is a separate process. Approval of the PHA Plan does not constitute approval of these activities.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim Plan for Demolition/Disposition.</E> (i) Before submission of the first Annual Plan, a PHA may submit an interim PHA Annual Plan solely for demolition/disposition. The interim plan must provide:</P>

If a resident advisory board has not yet been formed, the PHA may seek a waiver of the requirement to consult with the resident advisory board on the grounds that organizations that adequately represent residents for this purpose were consulted.</P>
              <P>(iii) The actual application for demolition or disposition may be submitted at the same time as submission of the interim plan or at a later date.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">A statement of the public housing developments designated as housing for elderly families or families with disabilities or elderly families and families with disabilities.</E> (1) With respect to public housing only, this statement identifies any public housing developments owned, assisted, or operated by the PHA, or any portion of these developments, that:</P>

              <P>(i) Any building or buildings that the PHA is required to convert to tenant-based assistance under section 33 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5);</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is a Resident Advisory Board and what is its role in development of the Annual Plan?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A Resident Advisory Board refers to a board or boards, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, whose membership consists of individuals who adequately reflect and represent the residents assisted by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(1) The role of the Resident Advisory Board (or Resident Advisory Boards) is to assist and make recommendations regarding the development of the PHA plan, and any significant amendment or modification to the PHA plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA shall allocate reasonable resources to assure the effective functioning of Resident Advisory Boards. Reasonable resources for the Resident Advisory Boards must provide reasonable means for them to become informed on programs covered by the PHA Plan, to communicate in writing and by telephone with assisted families and hold meetings with those families, and to access information regarding covered programs on the internet, taking into account the size and resources of the PHA.</P>
              <P>(b) Each PHA must establish one or more Resident Advisory Boards, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) If a jurisdiction-wide resident council exists that complies with the tenant participation regulations in part 964 of this title, the PHA shall appoint the jurisdiction-wide resident council or the council's representatives as the Resident Advisory Board. If the PHA makes such appointment, the members of the jurisdiction-wide resident council or the council's representatives shall be added or another Resident Advisory Board formed to provide for reasonable representation of families receiving tenant-based assistance where such representation is required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If a jurisdiction-wide resident council does not exist but resident councils exist that comply with the tenant participation regulations, the PHA shall appoint such resident councils or their representatives to serve on one or more Resident Advisory Boards. If the PHA makes such appointment, the PHA may require that the resident councils choose a limited number of representatives.</P>
              <P>(3) Where the PHA has a tenant-based assistance program of significant size (where tenant-based assistance is 20% or more of assisted households), the PHA shall assure that the Resident Advisory Board (or Boards) has reasonable representation of families receiving tenant-based assistance and that a reasonable process is undertaken to choose this representation.</P>
              <P>(4) Where or to the extent that resident councils that comply with the tenant participation regulations do not exist, the PHA shall appoint Resident Advisory Boards or Board members as needed to adequately reflect and represent the interests of residents of such developments; provided that the PHA shall provide reasonable notice to such residents and urge that they form resident councils with the tenant participation regulations.</P>
              <P>(c) The PHA must consider the recommendations of the Resident Advisory Board or Boards in preparing the final Annual Plan, and any significant amendment or modification to the Annual Plan, as provided in § 903.21 of this title.</P>

              <P>(1) In submitting the final plan to HUD for approval, or any significant amendment or modification to the plan <PRTPAGE P="275"/>to HUD for approval, the PHA must include a copy of the recommendations made by the Resident Advisory Board or Boards and a description of the manner in which the PHA addressed these recommendations.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the 75-day limitation on HUD review, in response to a written request from a Resident Advisory Board claiming that the PHA failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment, HUD may make a finding of good cause during the required time period and require the PHA to remedy the failure before final approval of the plan.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the relationship of the public housing agency plans to the Consolidated Plan, the Assessment of Fair Housing, and a PHA's Fair Housing Requirements?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The preparation of an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) is required once every 5 years, in accordance with 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180. PHAs have three options in meeting their AFH requirements. PHAs must notify HUD of the option they choose. The options are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Option 1: Assessment of Fair Housing with Units of General Local Government or State Governmental Agencies.</E> (i) A PHA may work with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH.</P>
              <P>(A) A PHA must choose the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions.</P>
              <P>(B) If the PHA serves residents of two or more jurisdictions, the PHA may choose the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has preexisting obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</P>
              <P>(C) If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must work with the general unit of local government named in the Agreement or Decree, when preparing the AFH.</P>
              <P>(ii) A PHA working with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH will have fulfilled the requirements of AFH submission when the general unit of local government or State governmental agency submits an AFH.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the unit of general local government or state governmental agency's AFH is accepted, all PHAs working with the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of the AFH will be covered by the applicable goals contained in the AFH.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a PHA joins with a unit of general local government or State governmental agency in the preparation of an AFH, the PHA must ensure that its PHA Plan is consistent with the general unit of local government's or State governmental agency's applicable consolidated plan and its AFH. (See also 24 CFR 5.158 for coordination when preparing an AFH jointly with a jurisdiction.)</P>
              <P>(v) PHAs are encouraged to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with units of general local government, State governmental agencies, and other PHAs to clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process of the program participants in the creation of the AFH.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Option 2: Assessment of Fair Housing with Public Housing Agencies.</E> (i) A PHA may jointly participate with one or more PHAs in the planning, participation, and preparation of the AFH consistent with the requirements of 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, and with the geographic scope and proposed actions scaled to the PHAs' operations and region, as provided in § 5.154.</P>
              <P>(A) PHAs preparing a joint submission of an AFH are encouraged to prepare MOUs or other such cooperative agreements, which clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process for the jointly participating PHAs. The MOU or cooperative agreement should also clearly indicate a lead agency that will submit on behalf of the joint participants.</P>

              <P>(B) An accepted AFH submitted on behalf of jointly participating PHAs <PRTPAGE P="276"/>will fulfill the submission requirements for all entities.</P>
              <P>(C) If jointly participating PHAs' AFH is accepted, all PHAs participating in the creation of the AFH will be covered by the applicable goals contained in the AFH.</P>
              <P>(ii) If a PHA joins with other PHAs in the submission of an AFH, the PHA must ensure that its 5-year PHA Plan is consistent with the AFH and its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing.</P>
              <P>(iii) A PHA that is jointly participating with other PHAs in the creation of an AFH must certify consistency with the consolidated plan of the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions. If a PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions then:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA may choose to certify consistency with the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has pre-existing obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</P>
              <P>(B) If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must certify consistency with the general unit of local government named in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement or Consent Decree, when preparing the AFH.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the event that HUD accepts an AFH under this option, and such AFH conflicts with the accepted AFH conducted by the unit of general local government or State governmental agency, a PHA's certification of consistency with the consolidated plan shall be accepted as a certification of consistency with the consolidated plan for all actions that do not directly conflict with the PHA's AFH that has been accepted by HUD.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Option 3: Independent PHA Assessment of Fair Housing.</E> (i) A PHA may conduct its own AFH with geographic scope and proposed actions scaled to the PHA's operations and region, in accordance with 24 CFR 5.154(d). An accepted AFH submitted by a PHA performing an independent AFH will fulfill the submission requirements for that PHA and the PHA shall be covered by the goals contained in the AFH.</P>
              <P>(ii) A PHA that is performing its own AFH must certify consistency with the consolidated plan of the unit of general local government or State governmental agency in which the PHA is located, unless the PHA's service area is within two or more jurisdictions. If a PHA's service area is in two or more jurisdictions then:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA may choose to certify consistency with the jurisdiction that most closely aligns to its planning activities under this part and 24 CFR part 905, unless the PHA has pre-existing obligations prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, such as a Recovery Agreement, Voluntary Compliance Agreement, or Consent Decree.</P>
              <P>(B) If a PHA has a preexisting obligation prescribed in a binding agreement with HUD or the courts, the PHA must certify consistency with the general unit of local government named in the Voluntary Compliance Agreement or Consent Decree, when preparing the AFH.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the event that HUD accepts an AFH under this option, and such AFH conflicts with the AFH conducted by the unit of general local government or State governmental agency, the PHA's certification of consistency with the consolidated plan shall be accepted as a certification of consistency with the consolidated plan for all actions that do not directly conflict with the PHA's AFH that has been accepted by HUD.</P>
              <P>(b) PHAs may but are not required to request a change in their fiscal years to better coordinate their planning cycle with the planning performed under each of the options listed in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(c) If a material change in circumstances occurs in the jurisdiction of a PHA that requires a revision to the AFH, as specified in 24 CFR 5.164, the PHA will have up to 12 months to incorporate any goals from the revised AFH into its 5-Year PHA Plan, in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR 903.21.<PRTPAGE P="277"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Fair housing requirements.</E> A PHA is obligated to affirmatively further fair housing in its operating policies, procedures, and capital activities. All admission and occupancy policies for public housing and Section 8 tenant-based housing programs must comply with Fair Housing Act requirements and other civil rights laws and regulations and with a PHA's plans to affirmatively further fair housing. The PHA may not impose any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination.</E> A PHA must carry out its PHA Plan in conformity with the nondiscrimination requirements in Federal civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Fair Housing Act. A PHA may not assign housing to persons in a particular section of a community or to a development or building based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin for purposes of segregating populations.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.</E> A PHA's policies should be designed to reduce the concentration of tenants and other assisted persons by race, national origin, and disability in conformity with any applicable Assessment of Fair Housing as defined at 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180 and the PHA's assessment of its fair housing needs. Any affirmative steps or incentives a PHA plans to take must be stated in the admission policy.</P>
              <P>(i) HUD regulations provide that PHAs must take steps to affirmatively further fair housing. PHA policies should include affirmative steps to overcome the effects of discrimination and the effects of conditions that resulted in limiting participation of persons because of their race, national origin, disability, or other protected class.</P>
              <P>(ii) Such affirmative steps may include, but are not limited to, marketing efforts, use of nondiscriminatory tenant selection and assignment policies that lead to desegregation, additional applicant consultation and information, provision of additional supportive services and amenities to a development (such as supportive services that enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community), and engagement in ongoing coordination with state and local disability agencies to provide additional community-based housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities and to connect such individuals with supportive services to enable an individual with a disability to transfer from an institutional setting into the community.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Validity of certification.</E> (i) A PHA's certification under § 903.7(o) will be subject to challenge by HUD where it appears that a PHA:</P>
              <P>(A) Fails to meet the affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements at 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, including failure to take meaningful actions to further the goals identified in the AFH; or</P>
              <P>(B) Takes action that is materially inconsistent with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing; or</P>
              <P>(C) Fails to meet the fair housing, civil rights, and affirmatively furthering fair housing requirements in 24 CFR 903.7(o).</P>

              <P>(ii) If HUD challenges the validity of a PHA's certification, HUD will do so in writing specifying the deficiencies, and will give the PHA an opportunity to respond to the particular challenge in writing. In responding to the specified deficiencies, a PHA must establish, as applicable, that it has complied with fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, or has remedied violations of fair housing and civil rights laws and regulations, and has adopted policies and undertaken actions to affirmatively further fair housing, including, but not limited to, providing a full range of housing opportunities to applicants and tenants and taking affirmative steps as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section in a nondiscriminatory manner. In responding to the PHA, HUD may accept the PHA's explanation and withdraw the challenge, undertake further investigation, or pursue other remedies available under law. HUD will seek to obtain voluntary corrective action consistent with the specified deficiencies. In determining whether a PHA has complied with its certification, HUD will review the <PRTPAGE P="278"/>PHA's circumstances relevant to the specified deficiencies, including characteristics of the population served by the PHA; characteristics of the PHA's existing housing stock; and decisions, plans, goals, priorities, strategies, and actions of the PHA, including those designed to affirmatively further fair housing.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review of the plan.</E> When the PHA submits its Annual Plan to HUD, including any significant amendment or modification to the plan, HUD reviews the plan to determine whether:</P>
              <P>(1) The plan provides all the information that is required to be included in the plan;</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disapproval of the plan.</E> (1) HUD may disapprove a PHA plan, in its entirety or with respect to any part, or disapprove any significant amendment or modification to the plan, only if <PRTPAGE P="279"/>HUD determines that the plan, or one of its components or elements, or any significant amendment or modification to the plan:</P>
              <P>(i) Does not provide all the information that is required to be included in the plan;</P>
              <P>(ii) Is not consistent with the information and data available to HUD;</P>

The notice that HUD issues to the PHA must state with specificity the reasons for the disapproval. HUD may not state as a reason for disapproval the lack of time to review the plan.</P>
              <P>(3) If HUD fails to issue the notice of disapproval on or before the 75th day after the date on which the PHA submits its plan or significant amendment or modification to the plan, HUD shall be considered to have determined that all elements or components of the plan required to be submitted and that were submitted, and to be reviewed by HUD were in compliance with applicable requirements and the plan has been approved.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> This subpart sets forth the essential elements of the HUD Homeownership Opportunities Program for Low-Income Families (Turnkey III).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart is applicable to Turnkey III developments operated by LHA. For Turnkey III developments operated by an Indian Housing Authority, applicable provisions are found at 24 CFR part 905, subpart G.</P>
              <P>(1) With respect to any development to be operated as Turnkey III, the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) shall contain the “Special Provisions for Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Project” as set forth in Appendix I. A Turnkey III development may include only units which are to be operated as such under Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreements. If for any reason it is determined that certain units should be operated as conventional rental units, such units must comprise or be made part of a conventional rental project.</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to Turnkey III developments pursuant to an executed ACC where no Agreements with Homebuyers have been signed, the ACC shall be amended (i) to include the “Special Provisions” set forth in Appendix I, (ii) to extend its term to 30 years, and (iii) to reduce its Maximum Contribution Percentage to a rate that will amortize the debt in 30 years at the minimum Loan Interest Rate specified in the ACC for the specific Turnkey III project involved. Further development and operation shall be in accordance with this subpart including use of the form of Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement set forth in Appendix II.</P>
              <P>(3) With respect to developments where Agreements with homebuyers have been signed, the following steps shall be taken:</P>

              <P>(i) The ACC shall be amended to include the Special Provisions” set forth in Appendix I; further development and operation of the Project shall be in accordance with this subpart.<PRTPAGE P="281"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The LHA shall offer all qualified homebuyers in the development a new Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement as set forth in Appendix II with an amendment to section 16a to refer to “the latest approved Development Cost Budget, or Actual Development Cost Certificate if issued,” in lieu of “the Development Cost Budget in effect upon award of the Main Construction Contract or execution of the Contract of Sale,” and, if the ACC for the Project has a term of 25 years, an amendment to section 16(b) to refer to a term of 25 years, instead of 30, for the Purchase Price Schedule. Each Purchase Price Schedule shall commence with the first day of the month following the effective date of the initial Agreement. No other modification in the new Agreement may be made. In the event the homebuyer refuses to accept the new Agreement, no modifications may be made in the old Agreement and the matter shall be referred to HUD.</P>
              <P>(4) With respect to Projects which were under ACC on the effective date of this subpart, the Total Development Cost Budget shall be revised, if financially feasible, to include the cost of the appraisals which are necessary for computation of the initial purchase prices pursuant to § 904.113. In the event this is not financially feasible, the matter shall be referred to HUD, which may, if necessary, authorize a different method for computation of such initial purchase prices on an equitable basis.</P>
              <P>(5) With respect to all developments which were completed by the effective date of this subpart, the appraisals which are necessary for computation of the initial purchase prices pursuant to § 904.113 shall be made as of the date of completion of the development.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Financial framework.</E> The LHA shall finance development or acquisition by sale of its notes (bond financing shall not be used) in the amount of the Minimum Development Cost. Payment <PRTPAGE P="282"/>of the debt service on the notes is assured by the HUD commitment to provide annual contributions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum total development cost.</E> The maximum total development cost stated in the ACC is the maximum amount authorized for development of a project and shall not exceed the amount approved in accordance with § 941.406(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contractual framework.</E> There are three basic contracts:</P>
              <P>(1) An Annual Contributions Contract containing “Special Provisions For Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Project,” Form HUD-53010C (see Appendix I);</P>
              <P>(2) A Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement (see Appendix II) which sets forth the respective rights and obligations of the low-income occupants and the LHA, including conditions for achieving homeownership; and</P>
              <P>(3) A Recognition Agreement (see Appendix II of Subpart D of this part) between the LHA and the HBA under which the LHA agrees to recognize the HBA as the established representative of the homebuyers.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Community Participation Committee</E> (<E T="03">CPC</E>). In the necessary development of citizens' participation in and understanding of the Turnkey III program, the LHA should consider formation and use of a CPC to assist the community and the LHA in the development and support of the Turnkey III program. The CPC shall be a voluntary group comprised of representatives of the low-income population primarily and may also include representatives of community service organizations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility and selection of homebuyers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Announcement of availability of housing; fair housing marketing.</E> (1) The availability of housing under Turnkey III shall be announced to the community at large. Families on the waiting list for LHA conventional rental housing who wish to be considered for Turnkey III must apply specifically for that program (see paragraph (d) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) The LHA shall submit to HUD an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan and shall otherwise comply with the provisions of the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations, 24 CFR part 200, subpart M, as if the LHA were an applicant for participation in an FHA housing program. This Plan shall be submitted with the development program, and no development program may be approved without prior approval of the Plan pursuant to HUD procedures under said Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations. If the development program has been approved, but the Annual Contributions Contract has not been executed, prior to the effective date of this subpart, an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan must be approved prior to execution of said contract.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility and standards for admission.</E> (1) Homebuyers shall be lower income families that are determined to be eligible for admission in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR parts 5 and 913, which prescribe income definitions, income limits, and restrictions concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status. The HUD-approved standards for admission to low-rent housing, including the LHA's established priorities and preferences and the requirements for administration of low-rent housing under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 42 U.S.C. 2000d), shall be applicable except that the procedures used for homebuyer selection under Turnkey III shall be those set forth in this section. In carrying out these procedures the aim shall be to provide for equal housing opportunity in such a way as to prevent segregation or other discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color or national origin in accordance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 42 U.S.C. 2000d) and 1968 (Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 73, 42 U.S.C. 3601).</P>

              <P>(2) An LHA may establish income limits for Turnkey III which are different from those for its conventional rental program: <E T="03">Provided</E> That those limits are in accord with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements and are approved by HUD.<PRTPAGE P="283"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of eligibility and preparation of list.</E> The LHA, without participation of a recommending committee (see paragraph (e)(1) of this section), must determine the eligibility of each applicant family in respect to the income limits for the development (including the requirement that the applicant family disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 750, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 760), and must then assign each eligible applicant its appropriate place on a waiting list for the development, in sequence based upon the date of the application, suitable type or size of unit, qualification for a Federal preference in accordance with § 904.122, and factors affecting preference or priority established by the LHA's regulations. Notwithstanding the fact that the LHA may not be accepting additional applications because of the length of the waiting list, the LHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for participation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in § 904.122(c)(2), unless the LHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions to housing under Turnkey III, that—</P>
              <P>(1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference, and</P>
              <P>(2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the LHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for admission before other applicants on the waiting list.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">List of applicants.</E> A separate list of applicants for Turnkey III shall be maintained, consisting of families who specifically apply and are eligible for admission to such housing.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Dating of applications.</E> All applications for Turnkey III shall be dated as received.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect on applicant status.</E> The filing of an application for Turnkey III by a family which is an applicant for LHA conventional rental housing or is an occupant of such housing shall in no way affect its status with regard to such rental housing. Such an applicant shall not lose his place on the rental housing waiting list until his application is accepted for Turnkey III and shall not receive any different treatment or consideration with respect to conventional rental housing because of having applied for Turnkey III.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of potential for homeownership</E>—(1) <E T="03">Recommending committee.</E> The LHA should consider use of a recommending committee to assist in the establishment of objective criteria for the determination of potential for homeownership and in the selection of homebuyers from the families determined to have such potential. If a recommending committee is used, it should be composed of representatives of the CPC (if any), the LHA and the HBA. The LHA shall submit to the committee prompt written justification of any rejection of a committee recommendation, stating grounds, the reasonableness of which shall be in accord with applicable LHA and HUD regulations. Each member of such a committee, at the time of appointment, shall be required to furnish the LHA with a signed statement that the member will (i) follow selection procedures and policies that do not automatically deny admission to a particular class, that insure selection on a nondiscriminatory and nonsegregated basis, and that facilitate achievement of the anticipated results for occupancy stated in the approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, and (ii) maintain strict confidentiality by not divulging any information concerning applicants or the deliberations of the committee to any person except to the LHA as necessary for purposes of the official business of the committee.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Potential for homeownership.</E> In order to be considered for selection, a family must be determined to meet at least all of the following standards of potential for homeownership:</P>

              <P>(i) Income sufficient to result in a required monthly payment which is not <PRTPAGE P="284"/>less than the sum of the amounts necessary to pay the EHPA, the NRMR, and the estimated average monthly cost of utilities attributable to the home;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ability to meet all the obligations of a homebuyer under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;</P>
              <P>(iii) At least one member gainfully employed, or having an established source of continuing income.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Selection of homebuyers.</E> Homebuyers shall be selected from those families determined to have potential for homeownership. Such selection shall be made in sequence from the waiting list established in accordance with this section, provided that the following shall be assured:</P>
              <P>(1) Selection procedures that do not automatically deny admission to a particular class; that ensure selection on a nondiscriminatory and nonsegregated basis; that give a Federal preference in accordance with § 904.122; and that facilitate achievement of the anticipated results for occupancy stated in the approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Achievement of an average monthly payment for the Project, including consideration of the availability of the Special Family Subsidy, which is at least 10 percent more than the breakeven amount for the Project (see § 904.108). This standard shall be complied with both in the initial selection of homebuyers and in the subsequent filling of vacancies at all times during the life of the Project. If there is an applicant who has potential for homeownership but whose required monthly payment under the LHA's Rent Schedule would be less than the break-even amount for the suitable size and type of unit, such applicant may be selected as a homebuyer, provided that the incomes of all selected homebuyers shall result in the required average monthly payment of at least 10 percent more than the break-even amount for the Project. Such an average monthly payment for the Project may be achieved by selecting other low-income families who can afford to make required monthly payments substantially above the break-even amounts for their suitable sizes and types of units.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Notification to applicants.</E> (1) Once a sufficient number of applicants have been selected to assure that the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section are met, the selected applicant shall be notified of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as such date can reasonably be determined.</P>
              <P>(2) Applicants who are not selected for a specific Turnkey III development shall be notified in accordance with HUD-approved procedure. The notice shall state:</P>
              <P>(i) The reason for the applicant's rejection (including a nonrecommendation by the recommending committee unless the applicant has previously been so notified by the committee);</P>
              <P>(ii) That the applicant will be given an information hearing on such determination, regardless of the reason for the rejection, if the applicant makes a request for such a hearing within a reasonable time (to be specified in the notice) from the date of the notice; and</P>
              <P>(iii) For denial of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, the applicant may request, in addition to the informal hearing, an appeal to the INS, in accordance with 24 CFR part 5.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Eligibility for continued occupancy.</E> (1) A homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the LHA determines that the homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the current amount of the homebuyer's Total Tenant Payment, determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter, equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section). In such event, if the LHA determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the LHA shall notify the homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the home or (ii) move from the development. If, however, the LHA determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe, and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may <PRTPAGE P="285"/>be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent an amount equal to Tenant Rent, as determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.</P>
              <P>(2) The term “monthly housing cost,” as used in this paragraph, means the sum of:</P>
              <P>(i) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the homebuyer can purchase the home by the method described in § 904.113(c)(1) of this part);</P>
              <P>(ii) One-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the homebuyer will be required to pay as a homeowner;</P>
              <P>(iii) One-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the LHA with respect to the home;</P>
              <P>(iv) The current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA), and for routine maintenance-common property; and</P>
              <P>(v) The current LHA and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the LHA.</P>

It is formed and organized for the purposes set forth in § 904.304 of this part. The HBA shall be funded as provided in § 904.305 of this part.

              <SUBJECT>Responsibilities of homebuyer.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Repair, maintenance and use of home.</E> The homebuyer shall be responsible for the routine maintenance of the home to the satisfaction of the HBA and the LHA. This routine maintenance includes the work (labor and materials) of keeping the dwelling structure, grounds and equipment in good repair, condition and appearance so that they may be utilized continually at their designed capacities and at the satisfactory level of efficiency for their intended purposes, and in conformity with the requirements of local housing code and applicable regulations and guidelines of HUD. It includes repairs (labor and materials) to the dwelling structure, plumbing fixtures, dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), shades and screens, water heater, heating equipment and other component parts of the dwelling. It also includes all interior painting and the maintenance of grounds (lot) on which the dwelling is located. It does not include maintenance and replacements provided for by the NRMR described in § 904.111.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Repair of damage.</E> In addition to the obligation for routine maintenance, the homebuyer shall be responsible for repair of any damage caused by him, members of his family, or visitors.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Care of home.</E> A homebuyer shall keep the home in a sanitary condition; cooperate with the LHA and the HBA <PRTPAGE P="286"/>in keeping and maintaining the common areas and property, including fixtures and equipment, in good condition and appearance; and follow all rules of the LHA and of the HBA concerning the use and care of the dwellings and the common areas and property.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inspections.</E> A homebuyer shall agree to permit officials, employees, or agents of the LHA and of the HBA to inspect the home at reasonable hours and intervals in accordance with rules established by the LHA and the HBA.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Use of home.</E> A homebuyer shall not (1) sublet the home without the prior written approval of the LHA and HUD, (2) use or occupy the home for any unlawful purpose nor for any purpose deemed hazardous by insurance companies on account of fire or other risks, or (3) provide accommodations (unless approved by the HBA and the LHA) to boarders or lodgers. The homebuyer shall agree to use the home only as a place to live for the family (as identified in the initial application or by subsequent amendment with the approval of the LHA), for children thereafter born to or adopted by members of such family, and for aged or widowed parents of the homebuyer or spouse who may join the household.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Obligations with respect to other persons and property.</E> Neither the homebuyer nor any member of his family shall interfere with rights of other occupants of the development, or damage the common property or the property of others, or create physical hazards.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Structural changes.</E> A homebuyer shall not make any structural changes in or additions to the home unless the LHA has first determined in writing that such change would not (1) impair the value of the unit, the surrounding units, or the development as a whole, or (2) affect the use of the home for residential purposes, or (3) violate HUD requirements as to construction and design.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Statements of condition and repair.</E> When each homebuyer moves in, the LHA shall inspect the home and shall give the homebuyer a written statement, to be signed by the LHA and the homebuyer, of the condition of the home and the equipment in it. Should the homebuyer vacate the home, the LHA shall inspect it and give the homebuyer a written statement of the repairs and other work, if any, required to put the home in good condition for the next occupant (see § 904.110(j)(1)). The homebuyer, his representative, and a representative of the HBA may join in any such inspections by the LHA.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Maintenance of common property.</E> The homebuyer may participate in nonroutine maintenance of his home and in maintenance of common property as discussed in § 904.110(d) and § 904.111(c).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Homebuyer's required monthly payment.</E> (1) The term “required monthly payment” as used herein means the monthly payment the homebuyer is required to pay the LHA on or before the first day of each month. The homebuyer's required monthly payment, which is based upon family income, shall be an amount equal to the Tenant Rent as determined in accordance with part 913 of this chapter. If the Utility Allowance, as defined in part 913 of this chapter, exceeds the Homebuyer's Total Tenant Payment, as determined in accordance with part 913, the LHA will pay a utility reimbursement equal to that excess to the Homebuyer, or as provided in § 913.108 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) For purposes of determining eligibility of an applicant (see 24 CFR parts 5 and 913, as well as this part) and the amount of Homebuyer payments under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the LHA shall examine the family's income and composition and follow the procedures required by 24 CFR part 5 for determining citizenship or eligible immigration status before initial occupancy. Thereafter, for the purposes stated in this paragraph and to determine whether a Homebuyer is required to purchase the home under § 904.104(h)(1), the LHA shall reexamine the Homebuyer's income and composition regularly, at least once every 12 months, and shall undertake such further determination and verification of citizenship or eligible immigration status as required by 24 CFR part 5. The Homebuyer shall comply with the LHA's policy regarding required interim reporting of changes in the family's income and composition. If the LHA receives information from the family or other <PRTPAGE P="287"/>source concerning a change in the family income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the LHA, upon consultation with the family and verification of the information (in accordance with 24 CFR parts 5 and 913 of this chapter) shall promptly make any adjustments determined to be appropriate in the Homebuyer payment amount or take appropriate action concerning the addition of a family member who is not a citizen with eligible immigration status. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent must be verified.</P>
              <P>(3) The LHA shall not refuse to accept monthly payments because of any other charges (other than overdue monthly payments) owed by the homebuyer to the LHA; however, by accepting monthly payments under such circumstances the LHA shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies with respect to such other charges.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Application of monthly payment.</E> The LHA shall apply the homebuyer's monthly payment as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) To the credit of the homebuyer's EHPA (see § 904.110);</P>
              <P>(2) To the credit of the homebuyer's NRMR (see § 904.111); and</P>
              <P>(3) For payment of monthly operating expense including contribution to operating reserve (see § 904.109).</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Assignment and survivorship.</E> Until such time as the homebuyer obtains title to the home, it shall be used only to house a family of low income. Therefore:</P>
              <P>(1) A homebuyer shall not assign any right or interest in the home or under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement without the prior written approval of the LHA and HUD;</P>
              <P>(2) In the event of death, mental incapacity or abandonment of the family by the homebuyer, the person designated as the successor in the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement shall succeed to the rights and responsibilities under the Agreement if that person is an occupant of the home at the time of the event and is determined by the LHA to meet all of the standards of potential for homeownership as set forth in § 904.104(e)(2). Such person shall be designated by the homebuyer at the time the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is executed. This designation may be changed by the homebuyer at any time. If there is no such designation or the designee is no longer an occupant of the home or does not meet the standards of potential for homeownership, the LHA may consider as the homebuyer any family member who was an occupant at the time of the event and who meets the standards of potential for homeownership.</P>
              <P>(3) If there is no qualified successor in accordance with paragraph (l) (2) of this section, the LHA shall terminate the Agreement and another family shall be selected except under the following circumstances: where a minor child or children of the homebuyer family are in occupancy, then in order to protect their continued occupancy and opportunity for acquisition of ownership of the home, the LHA may approve as occupants of the unit, an appropriate adult(s) who has been appointed legal guardian of the children with a duty to perform the obligations of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement in their interest and behalf.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Termination by LHA.</E> (1) In the event the homebuyer breaches the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement by failure to make the required monthly payment within ten days after its due date, by misrepresenting or withholding of information in applying for admission or in connection with any subsequent reexamination of income and family composition (including the failure to submit any required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status, as provided by 24 CFR part 5; the failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5; or the failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or by failure to comply with any of the other homebuyer obligations under the Agreement, the LHA may terminate the Agreement. No termination under this paragraph may occur less than 30 days after the <PRTPAGE P="288"/>LHA gives the homebuyer notice of its intention to do so, in accordance with paragraph (m)(3) of this section. For termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status under 24 CFR part 5, the requirements of 24 CFR parts 5 and 966 shall apply.</P>
              <P>(2) Notice of termination by the LHA shall be in writing. Such notice shall state</P>
              <P>(i) The reason for termination,</P>
              <P>(ii) That the homebuyer may respond to the LHA, in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable period of time regarding the reason for termination,</P>
              <P>(iii) That in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice, including a representative of the HBA,</P>
              <P>(iv) That the LHA will consult the HBA concerning this termination, and</P>
              <P>(v) That unless the LHA rescinds or modifies the notice, the termination shall be effective at the end of the 30-day notice period.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Termination by the homebuyer.</E> The homebuyer may terminate the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement by giving the LHA 30 days notice in writing of this intention to terminate and vacate the home. In the event that the homebuyer vacates the home without notice to the LHA, the Agreement shall be terminated automatically and the LHA may dispose of, in any manner deemed suitable by it, any items of personal property left by the homebuyer in the home.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Transfer to rental unit.</E> (1) Inasmuch as the homebuyer was found eligible for admission to the Project on the basis of having the necessary elements of potential for homeownership, continuation of eligibility requires continuation of this potential, subject only to temporary unforeseen changes in circumstances. Accordingly, in the event it should develop that the homebuyer no longer meets one or more of these elements of homeownership potential, the LHA shall investigate the circumstances and provide such counseling and assistance as may be feasible in order to help the family overcome the deficiency as promptly as possible. After a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the investigation, the LHA shall make a re-evaluation as to whether the family has regained the potential for homeownership or is likely to do so within a further reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the reevaluation. Further extension of time may be granted in exceptional cases, but in any event, a final determination shall be made no later than 90 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the initial investigation. The LHA shall invite the HBA to participate in all investigations and evaluations.</P>
              <P>(2) If the final determination of the LHA, after considering the views of the HBA, is that the homebuyer should be transferred to a suitable dwelling unit in an LHA rental project, the LHA shall give the homebuyer written notice of the LHA determination of the loss of homeownership potential and of the offer of transfer to a rental unit. The notice shall state that the transfer shall occur as soon as a suitable rental unit is available for occupancy, but no earlier than 30 days from the date of the notice, provided that an eligible successor for the homebuyer unit has been selected by the LHA. The notice shall also state that if the homebuyer should refuse to move under such circumstances, the family may be required to vacate the homebuyer unit, without further notice. The notice shall include a statement (i) that the homebuyer may respond to the LHA in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable time, regarding the reason for the determination and offer of transfer, (ii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice including a representative of the HBA, and (iii) that the LHA has consulted the HBA concerning this determination and offer of transfer.</P>

              <P>(3) When a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph (o), the amount in the homebuyer's EHPA <PRTPAGE P="289"/>shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of § 904.110(j).</P>

A separate break-even amount shall be established for each size and type of dwelling unit, as well as for the Project as a whole. The break-even amount for EHPA and NRMR will vary by size and type of dwelling unit; similar variations as to other line items may be made if the LHA deems this equitable.

              <SUBJECT>Monthly operating expense.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition and categories of monthly operating expense.</E> The term “monthly operating expense” means the monthly amount needed for the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Administration.</E> Administrative salaries, travel, legal expenses, office supplies, postage, telephone and telegraph, etc.;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Homebuyer services.</E> LHA expenses in the achievement of social goals, including costs such as salaries, publications, payments to the HBA to assist its operation, contract and other costs;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Utilities.</E> Those utilities (such as water), if any, to be furnished by the LHA as part of operating expense;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Routine maintenance—common property.</E> For community building, grounds, and other common areas, if any. The amount required for routine maintenance of common property depends upon the type of common property included in the development and the extent of the LHA's responsibility for maintenance (see also § 904.109(c));</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Protective services.</E> The cost of supplemental protective services paid by the LHA for the protection of persons and property;</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">General expense.</E> Premiums for fire and other insurance, payments in lieu of taxes to the local taxing body, collection losses, payroll taxes, etc.;</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Nonroutine maintenance—common property (Contribution to operating reserve).</E> Extraordinary maintenance of equipment applicable to the community building and grounds, and unanticipated items for non-dwelling structures (see § 904.112).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Monthly operating expense rate.</E> The monthly operating expense rate for each fiscal year shall be established on the basis of the LHA's HUD-approved operating budget for that fiscal year. The operating budget may be revised during the course of the fiscal year in accordance with HUD requirements. If it is subsequently determined that the actual operating expense for a <PRTPAGE P="290"/>fiscal year was more or less than the amount provided by the monthly operating expense established for that fiscal year, the rate of monthly operating expenses to be established for the next fiscal year may be adjusted to account for the difference (see § 904.112(b)). Such adjustment may result in a change in the required monthly payment, see § 904.107(j)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Provision for common property maintenance.</E> During the period the LHA is responsible for the maintenance of common property, the annual operating budget and the monthly operating expense rate shall include the amount required for routine maintenance of all common property in the development, even though a number of the homes may have been acquired by homebuyers. During such period, this amount shall be computed on the basis of the total number of homes in the development (i. e., the annual amount budgeted for routine maintenance of common property shall be divided by the number of homes in the development, resulting in the annual amount for each home; this figure shall in turn be divided by 12 to determine the monthly amount to be included in the monthly operating expense (and in the break-even amount) for routine maintenance of common property). After the home owners association assumes responsibility for maintenance of common property, the monthly operating expense (and break-even amount) shall include an amount equal to the monthly assessment by the homeowners association for the remaining homes owned by the LHA (see § 904.112(b) for nonroutine maintenance of common property).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Posting of monthly operating expense statement.</E> A statement showing the budgeted monthly amount allocated in the current operating budget to each operating expense category shall be provided to the HBA and copies shall be provided to homebuyers upon request.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Earned Home Payments Account (EHPA)</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Credits to the account.</E> The LHA shall establish and maintain a separate EHPA for each homebuyer. Since the homebuyer is responsible for maintaining the home, a portion of his required monthly payment equal to the LHA's estimate, approved by HUD, of the monthly cost for such routine maintenance, taking into consideration the relative type and size of the homebuyer's home, shall be set aside in his EHPA. In addition, this account shall be credited with</P>
              <P>(1) Any voluntary payments made pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, and</P>
              <P>(2) Any amount earned through the performance of maintenance as provided in paragraph (d) of this section and § 904.111(c).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Charges to the account.</E> (1) If for any reason the homebuyer is unable or fails to perform any item of required maintenance as described in § 904.107(a), the LHA shall arrange to have the work done in accordance with the procedures established by the LHA and the HBA and the cost thereof shall be charged to the homebuyer's EHPA. Inspections of the home shall be made jointly by the LHA and the HBA.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent NRMR expense is attributable to the negligence of the homebuyer as determined by the HBA and approved by the LHA (see § 904.111), the cost thereof shall be charged to the EHPA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exercise of option; required amount in EHPA.</E> The homebuyer may exercise his option to buy the home, by paying the applicable purchase price pursuant to § 904.113 or § 904.115, only after satisfying the following conditions precedent:</P>
              <P>(1) Within the first two years of his occupancy, he has achieved a balance in his EHPA equal to 20 times the amount of the monthly EHPA credit as initially determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) He has met, and is continuing to meet, the requirements of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;</P>
              <P>(3) He has rendered, and is continuing to render, satisfactory performance of his responsibilities to the HBA.</P>

              <FP>When the homebuyer has met these conditions precedent, the LHA shall give the homebuyer a certificate to that effect. After achieving the required minimum EHPA balance within the first two years of his occupancy, <PRTPAGE P="291"/>the homebuyer shall continue to provide the required maintenance, thereby continuing to add to his EHPA. If the homebuyer fails to meet either his obligation to achieve the minimum EHPA balance, as specified, or his obligation thereafter to continue adding to the EHPA, the LHA and the HBA shall investigate and take appropriate corrective action, including termination of the Agreement by the LHA in accordance with § 904.107(m).</FP>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional equity through maintenance of common property.</E> Homebuyers may earn additional EHPA credits by providing in whole or in part any of the maintenance necessary to the common property of the development. When such maintenance is to be provided by the homebuyer, this may be done and credit earned therefor only pursuant to a prior written agreement between the homebuyer and the LHA (or the home owners association, depending on who has responsibility for maintenance of the property involved), covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the homebuyer is to receive. In such cases, the agreed amount shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and credited to the homebuyer's EHPA upon completion of the work.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Investment of excess.</E> (1) When the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the LHA shall notify the HBA and shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD and in accordance with any recommendations made by the HBA. If the HBA wishes to participate in the investment program, it should submit periodically to the LHA a list of HUD-approved securities, bonds, or obligations which the association recommends for investment by the LHA of the funds in the EHPAs. Interest earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each homebuyer's EHPA in proportion to the amount in each such reserve account.</P>
              <P>(2) Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the LHA shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances; (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of all the homebuyers' EHPAs, and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of all the homebuyers' EHPAs. This statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Voluntary payments.</E> To enable the homebuyer to acquire title to his home within a shorter period, he may, either periodically or in a lump sum, voluntarily make payments over and above his required monthly payments. Such voluntary payments shall be deposited to his credit in his EHPA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Delinquent monthly payments.</E> Under exceptional circumstances as determined by the HBA and the LHA, a homebuyer's EHPA may be used to pay his delinquent required monthly payments, provided the amount used for this purpose does not seriously deplete the account and provided that the homebuyer agrees to cooperate in such counseling as may be made available by the LHA or the HBA.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Annual statement to homebuyer.</E> The LHA shall provide an annual statement to each homebuyer specifying at least (1) the amount in his EHPA, and (2) the amount in his NRMR. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the LHA which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the NRMR shall be accounted for through a work order. A homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his home.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Withdrawal and assignment.</E> The homebuyer shall have no right to assign, withdraw, or in any way dispose of the funds in its EHPA except as provided in this section or in § 904.113 and § 904.115.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Application of EHPA upon vacating of dwelling.</E> (1) In the event a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement with the LHA is terminated or if the homebuyer vacates the home (see § 904.107 (m), (n) and (o)), the LHA shall charge against the homebuyer's EHPA the amounts required to pay</P>
              <P>(i) The amount due the LHA, including the monthly payments the homebuyer is obligated to pay up to the date he vacates;</P>

              <P>(ii) The monthly payment for the period the home is vacant, not to exceed <PRTPAGE P="292"/>30 days from the date of notice of intention to vacate, or, if the homebuyer fails to give notice of intention to vacate, 30 days from the date the home is put in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with § 904.107; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The cost of any routine maintenance, and of any nonroutine maintenance attributable to the negligence of the homebuyer, required to put the home in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with § 904.107.</P>
              <P>(2) If the EHPA balance is not sufficient to cover all of these charges, the LHA shall require the homebuyer to pay the additional amount due. If the amount in the account exceeds these charges, the excess shall be paid to the homebuyer.</P>
              <P>(3) Settlement with the homebuyer shall be made promptly after the actual cost of repairs to the dwelling has been determined (see paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section), provided that the LHA shall make every effort to make such settlement within 30 days from the date the homebuyer vacates. The homebuyer may obtain a settlement within 7 days of the date he vacates, even though the actual cost of such repair has not yet been determined, if he has given the LHA notice of intention to vacate at least 30 days prior to the date he vacates and if the amount to be charged against his EHPA for such repairs is based on the LHA's estimate of the cost thereof (determined after consultation with the appropriate representative of the HBA).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose of reserve.</E> The LHA shall establish and maintain a separate NRMR for each home, using a portion of the homebuyer's monthly payment. The purpose of the NRMR is to provide funds for the nonroutine maintenance of the home, which consists of the infrequent and costly items of maintenance and replacement shown on the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule for the home (see paragraph (b) of this section). Such maintenance may include the replacement of dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), replacement of roof, exterior painting, major repairs to heating and plumbing systems, etc. The NRMR shall not be used for nonroutine maintenance of common property, or for nonroutine maintenance relating to the home to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the Homebuyer's negligence or to defective materials or workmanship.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of reserve.</E> The amount of the monthly payments to be set aside for NRMR shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule showing the amount likely to be needed for nonroutine maintenance of the home during the term of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, taking into consideration the type of construction and dwelling equipment. This Schedule shall (1) list each item of nonroutine maintenance (e.g., range, refrigerator, plumbing, heating system, roofing, tile flooring, exterior painting, etc.), (2) show for each listed item the estimated frequency of maintenance or useful life before replacement, the estimated cost of maintenance or replacement (including installation) for each occasion, and the annual reserve requirement, and (3) show the total reserve requirements for all the listed items, on an annual and a monthly basis. This Schedule shall be prepared by the LHA and approved by HUD as part of the submission required to determine the financial feasibility of the Project. The Schedule shall be revised after approval of the working drawings and specifications, and shall thereafter be reexamined annually in the light of changing economic conditions and experience.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges to NRMR.</E> (1) The LHA shall provide the nonroutine maintenance necessary for the home and the cost thereof shall be funded as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such maintenance may be provided by the homebuyer but only pursuant to a prior written agreement with the LHA covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the homebuyer is to receive. The amount of any credit shall, upon completion of the work, be credited to the homebuyer's EHPA and charged as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The cost of nonroutine maintenance shall be charged to the NRMR <PRTPAGE P="293"/>for the home except that (i) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the homebuyer's EHPA after consultation with the HBA if the hombuyer disagrees, and (ii) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, or even though covered by warranty if not paid for thereunder through no fault or negligence of the homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense account of the Project.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event the amount charged against the NRMR exceeds the balance therein, the difference (deficit) shall be made up from continuing monthly credits to the NRMR based upon the homebuyer's monthly payments. If there is still a deficit when the homebuyer acquires title, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit at settlement (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer of NRMR.</E> (1) In the event the Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated, the homebuyer shall not receive any balance or be required to pay any deficit in the NRMR. When a subsequent homebuyer moves in, the NRMR shall continue to be applicable to the home in the same amount as if the preceding homebuyer had continued in occupancy.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event the homebuyer purchases the home, and there remains a balance in the NRMR, the LHA shall pay such balance to the homebuyer at settlement. In the event the homebuyer purchases and there is a deficit in the NRMR, the homebuyer shall pay such deficit to the LHA at settlement.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Investment of excess.</E> (1) When the aggregate amount of the NRMR balances for all the homes exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days the LHA shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD. Income earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each homebuyer's NRMR in proportion to the amount in each reserve account.</P>
              <P>(2) Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the LHA shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all NRMR balances, (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of the NRMRs, and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of the NRMRs. A copy of this statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonroutine maintenance—common property (Contribution to operating reserve).</E> The amount under this heading to be included in operating expense (and in the break-even amount) established for the fiscal year (see § 904.108 and § 904.109) shall be determined by the LHA, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of estimates of the monthly amount needed to accumulate an adequate reserve for the items described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. This amount shall be subject to revision in the light of experience. This contribution to the operating reserve shall be <PRTPAGE P="294"/>made only during the period the LHA is responsible for the maintenance of any common property; and during such period, the amount shall be determined on the basis of the requirements of all common property in the development in a manner similar to that explained in § 904.109(c). When the operating reserve reaches the maximum authorized in paragraph (c) of this section, the break-even (monthly operating expense) computations (see §§ 904.108 and 904.109) for the next and succeeding fiscal years need not include a provision for this contribution to the operating reserve unless the balance of the reserve is reduced below the maximum during any such succeeding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Maximum operating reserve.</E> The maximum operating reserve that may be retained by the LHA at the end of any fiscal year shall be the sum of (1) one-half of total routine expense included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year and (2) one-third of total break-even amounts included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year; provided that such maximum may be increased if necessary as determined or approved by HUD. Total routine expense means the sum of the amounts budgeted for administration, homebuyers services, LHA-supplied utilities, routine maintenance of common property, protective services, and general expense or other category of day-to-day routine expense (see § 904.109 above for explanation of various categories of expense).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Transfer to homeowners association.</E> The LHA shall be responsible for and shall retain custody of the operating reserve until the homeowners acquire voting control of the homeowners association (see §§ 904.118(c) and 904.119(f). When the homeowners acquire voting control, the homeowners association shall then assume full responsibility for management and maintenance of common property under a plan approved by HUD, and there shall be transferred to the homeowners association a portion of the operating reserve then held by the LHA. The amount of the reserve to be transferred shall be based upon the proportion that one-half of budgeted routine expense (used as a basis for determining the current maximum operating reserve—see paragraph (c) of this section) bears to the approved maximum operating reserve. Specifically, the portion of operating reserve to be transferred shall be computed as follows: Obtain a percentage by dividing one-half of budgeted routine expense by the approved maximum operating reserve; and multiply the actual operating reserve balance by this percentage.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Disposition of reserve.</E> If, at the end of a fiscal year, there is an excess over the maximum operating reserve this excess shall be applied to the operating deficit of the Project, if any, and any remainder shall be paid to HUD. Following the end of the fiscal year in which the last home has been conveyed by the LHA, the balance of the operating reserve held by the LHA shall be paid to HUD, provided that the aggregate amount of payments by the LHA under this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by HUD with respect to the Project.</P>

If for any reason title to the home is not conveyed to the homebuyer during the month in which such circumstances occur, the purchase price shall be fixed at the amount specified for such month and the homebuyer shall be refunded (i) the net additions, if any, credited to his EHPA subsequent to such month, and (ii) such part of the monthly payments made by the homebuyer after the purchase price has been fixed which exceeds the sum of the break-even amount attributable to the unit and the interest portion of the debt service shown in the Purchase Price Schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the sum of the purchase price and Incidental Costs is greater than the amounts in the homebuyer's EHPA and NRMR as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the homebuyer may achieve ownership by obtaining financing for or otherwise paying the excess amount. The purchase price shall be the amount shown on his Purchase Price Schedule for the month in which the settlement date for the purchase occurs.</P>
              <P>(d) The maximum period for achieving ownership shall be 30 years, but depending upon increases in the homebuyers income and the amount of credit which the homebuyer can accumulate through maintenance and voluntary payments, the period may be shortened accordingly.</P>

If, however, the homeowner should purchase and occupy another home within one year (18 months in case of a newly constructed home) of the resale of the Turnkey III home, the LHA shall refund to the homeowner the amount previously paid by him under the note, less the amount, if any, by which the resale price of the Turnkey III home exceeds the acquisition price of the new home, provided that application for such refund shall be <PRTPAGE P="296"/>made no later than 30 days after the date of acquisition of the new home.</P>
              <P>(2) The note to be signed by the homebuyer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be a non interest-bearing promissory note (see Appendix IV) to the LHA. The note shall be executed at the time the homebuyer becomes a homeowner and shall be secured by a second mortgage. The initial amount of the note shall be computed by taking the appraised value of the home at the time the homebuyer becomes a homeowner and subtracting (i) the homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs and (ii) the increase in value of the home, determined by appraisal, caused by improvements paid for by the homebuyer with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR. The note shall provide that this initial amount shall be automatically reduced by 20 percent thereof at the end of each year of residency as a homeowner, with the note terminating at the end of the five-year period of residency, as determined by the LHA. To protect the homeowner, the note shall provide that the amount payable under it shall in no event be more than the net profit on the resale, that is, the amount by which the resale price exceeds the sum of (A) the homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs, (B) the costs of the resale, including commissions and mortgage prepayment penalties, if any, and (C) the increase in value of the home, determined by appraisal, due to improvements paid for by him as a homebuyer (with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR) or as a homeowner.</P>

              <P>(3) Amounts collected by the LHA under such notes shall be retained by the LHA for use in making refunds pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. After expiration of the period for the filing of claims for such refunds, any remaining amounts shall be applied (i) to reduce the LHA's capital indebtedness on the Project and (ii) after such indebtedness has been paid, for such purposes as may be authorized or approved by HUD under such Annual Contributions Contract as the LHA may then have with HUD.

              <P>(1) The Local Authority agrees to operate the Project in accordance with requirements for the Homeownership Opportunity Program for Low-Income Families (Turnkey III) as prescribed by the Government. The Local Authority shall enter into an agreement with the occupant of each dwelling unit in the Project which agreement shall be in the form of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement approved by the Government, which form provides an opportunity for the acquisition of ownership of the dwelling unit by each occupant who has performed all of the obligations and conditions precedent imposed upon him by such agreement. Upon conveyance of any such dwelling unit, the Local Authority's outstanding obligations in respect to the Project shall be reduced by the amount received for such conveyance, and the Government's obligation for payment of annual contributions in respect to the Project shall be reduced by the amount allocable to the initial purchase price of the dwelling unit. The term “initial purchase price” as used in these Special Provisions shall have the same meaning as in the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement, and the term “dwelling unit” shall have the same meaning as the term “Home” used in the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) Failure of the Local Authority to enter into such Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreements at the time and in the form as required by the Government, failure to perform any such agreement, and failure to meet any of its obligations under these Special Provisions shall constitute a Substantial Default under this Contract.</P>
              <P>(3) The books of account and records of the Local Authority shall be maintained to meet the requirements of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement as well as the other provisions of this Contract and in such manner as will at all times show the operating receipts, operating expenditures, reserves, residual receipts, and other required accounts for the Project separate and distinct from all other Projects under this Contract.</P>
              <P>(4) As of the Date of Full Availability, or at such earlier date as the Government may require, the Local Authority shall determine and submit to the Government for its approval the amount below which the Development Cost of the Project will in no event fall. Upon approval thereof by the Government, such amount shall constitute and be known as the “Minimum Development Cost” of the Project. The Local Authority shall issue its Project Loan Notes, Permanent Notes or Project Notes as the Government may require to finance the Minimum Development Cost. On each Annual Contribution Date the Government shall pay an annual contribution for the Project in an amount equal to the Maximum Contribution Percentage of the latest approved Minimum Development Cost. The first annual contribution shall be paid or made available as of the next Annual Contribution Date following the approval of the Minimum Development Cost of the Project.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding section 403(A)(4), the term “Development Cost” shall include interest on that portion of borrowed monies allocable to the Project for the period ending with the Date of Full Availability or such earlier date as may be specifically approved by the Government.</P>
              <P>(6) (a) During the _ <SU>1</SU>
                <FTREF/> year Maximum Contribution Period established for the Project, the Local Authority shall, within 60 days after the end of each Fiscal Year, pay to the Government all Residual Receipts of the Project for such Fiscal Year for application to the reduction of Annual Contributions payable by the Government with respect to the Project.</P>

              <P>(c) Following the end of the Fiscal Year in which the last dwelling unit has been conveyed by the Local Authority, the balance of the operating reserve held by the Local Authority shall be paid to the Government, provided that the aggregate amount of payments under (b) and (c) of this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by the Government with respect to the Project.</P>
              <P>(7) No part of the Funds on deposit in the Debt Service Fund or the Advance Amortization Fund with respect to any other Project under this Contract or the funds available for deposit in such Funds for such other Projects, shall be applied to the retirement of Notes issued for this Project, nor shall any such funds on deposit for this Project be used with respect to any other Project or Projects under this Contract.</P>
              <P>(8) To the extent that the provisions of this section conflict with other provisions of this Contract, the provisions of this section shall be controlling with respect to the Project.</P>

Although the total monthly housing cost consists of the sum of the break-even amount (see section 8) and the debt service (payment of principal and interest) on the applicable share of the capital cost of the Development, the Homebuyer, so long as he qualifies as low income, is not required to pay the full amount, but is assisted by HUD annual contributions. The schedule shall provide for payments to be based upon a percentage of the family's adjusted monthly income and shall indicate allowances for those utilities which the Homebuyer will pay for directly.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Changes in monthly payment due to changes in family income or other circumstances.</E> The required Monthly Payment may be adjusted as a result of the Authority's regularly or specially scheduled reexamination of the Homebuyer's family income and family composition. Interim changes may be made in accordance with the Authority's policy on reexaminations, or under unusual circumstances, at the request of the Homebuyer, if both the Authority and the Homebuyers Association agree that such action is warranted.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Changes in monthly payment due to changes in rent schedules.</E> The required Monthly Payment may also be adjusted by changes in the required percentage of income to reflect (1) changes in operating expense as described in section 9b and (2) changes in utility allowances.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Acceptance of monthly payment.</E> The Authority shall not refuse to accept monthly payments because of any other charges (i.e., other than overdue monthly payments) owed by the Homebuyer to the Authority; however, by accepting monthly payments under such circumstances the Authority shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights and remedies with respect to such other charges.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Application of monthly payment.</E> The Homebuyer's Monthly Payment shall be applied by the Authority as follows: First, to the credit of the Homebuyer's EHPA pursuant to section 10 below; second, to the credit of the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve for the Home pursuant to Section 11 below; and third, for payment of Monthly Operating Expense, including contribution to Operating Reserve, as provided in section 9 below.</P>
              <P>8. <E T="03">Break-even amount</E>—a. <E T="03">Definition.</E> The term “Break-even Amount” means the minimum monthly amount needed to provide funds for:</P>
              <P>(1) Monthly Operating Expense, including provision for a contribution to Operating Reserve, pursuant to section 9a below;</P>

              <P>(3) The monthly amount to be credited to the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve for the Home pursuant to section 11 below.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Monthly payment in excess of break-even amount.</E> When the Homebuyer's required Monthly Payment exceeds the applicable Break-even Amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Monthly payment below break-even amount.</E> When the Homebuyer's required Monthly Payment is less than the applicable Break-even Amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the Monthly Payment designated for Operating Expense (i.e., as a reduction of project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the Break-even Amount for these accounts.</P>
              <P>9. <E T="03">Monthly operating expense</E>—a. <E T="03">Definition and categories of monthly operating expense.</E> The term “monthly operating expense” means the monthly amount needed for the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Administration.</E> Administrative salaries, travel, legal expenses, office supplies, postage, telephone and telegraph, etc.;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Homebuyer services.</E> Authority expenses in the achievement of social goals, including costs such as salaries, publications, payments to the HBA to assist its operation, contract and other costs;</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Utilities.</E> Those utilities (such as water), if any to be furnished by the Authority as part of operating expense;</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Routine maintenance—Common property.</E> For community building, grounds, and other common areas, if any. The amount required for routine maintenance of common property depends upon the type of common property included in the Development and the extent of the Authority's responsibility for maintenance (see also section 9c);</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Protective services.</E> The cost of supplemental protective services paid by the Authority for the protection of persons and property;</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">General expense.</E> Premiums for fire and other insurance, payments in lieu of taxes to the local taxing body, collection losses, payroll taxes, etc.;<PRTPAGE P="304"/>
              </P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Nonroutine maintenance—Common property (contribution to operating reserve).</E> Extraordinary maintenance of equipment applicable to the community building and grounds, and unanticipated items for non-dwelling structures (see section 12).</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Monthly operating expense rate.</E> The monthly operating expense rate for each fiscal year shall be established on the basis of the Authority's HUD-approved operating budget for that fiscal year. The operating budget may be revised during the course of the fiscal year in accordance with HUD requirements. If it is subsequently determined that the actual operating expense for a fiscal year was more or less than the amount provided by the monthly operating expense established for that fiscal year, the rate of monthly operating expense to be established for the next fiscal year may be adjusted to account for the difference (see section 12). Such adjustment may result in a change in the required monthly payment (see section 7c).</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Provision for common property maintenance.</E> During the period the Authority is responsible for the maintenance of common property, the annual operating budget and the monthly operating expense rate shall include the amount required for routine maintenance of all common property in the Development, even though a number of the homes may have been acquired by homebuyers. During such period, this amount shall be computed on the basis of the total number of homes in the Development (i.e., the annual amount budgeted for routine maintenance of common property shall be divided by the number of Homes in the Development, resulting in the annual amount for each Home; this figure shall in turn be divided by 12 to determine the monthly amount to be included in the monthly operating expense (and in the break-even amount) for routine maintenance of common property). After the Homeowners Association assumes responsibility for maintenance of common property, the monthly operating expense (and break-even amount) shall include an amount equal to the monthly assessment by the homeowners association for the remaining homes owned by the Authority (see section 11 for nonroutine maintenance of common property).</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Posting of monthly operating expense statement.</E> A statement showing the budgeted monthly amount allocated in the current operating budget to each operating expense category shall be provided to the HBA and a copy shall be provided to the Homebuyer upon request.</P>
              <P>10. <E T="03">Earned Home Payments Account (EHPA)</E>—a. <E T="03">Credits to the account.</E> The Authority shall establish and maintain a separate EHPA for each Homebuyer. Since the Homebuyer is responsible for maintaining his Home as provided in section 6, a portion of his required Monthly Payment equal to the Authority's estimate, approved by HUD, of the monthly cost for such routine maintenance, taking into consideration the relative type and size of the Home, shall be set aside in his EHPA. In addition, this account shall also be credited with (1) any voluntary payments made pursuant to section 10g and (2) any amount earned through the performance of maintenance pursuant to paragraph e of this section. All amounts received by the Authority for credit to the Homebuyer's account, including credits for performance of maintenance pursuant to paragraph e of this section, shall be held by the Authority for the account of the Homebuyer.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Use of EHPA funds.</E> The unused balance in the Homebuyer's EHPA may be used toward purchase of the Home as provided in section 16 or 17 as applicable, or shall be payable to the Homebuyer if he leaves the Project as provided in paragraph k of this section.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Charges to the account.</E> (1) If for any reason the Homebuyer is unable or fails to perform any item of required maintenance as described in section 6, the Authority shall arrange to have the work done in accordance with the procedures established by the Authority and the HBA and the cost thereof shall be charged to the Homebuyer's EHPA. Inspections of the Home shall be made jointly by the Authority and the HBA.</P>
              <P>(2) To the extent nonroutine maintenance expense is made necessary by the negligence of the Homebuyer as determined by the HBA and the Authority (see section 11), the cost thereof shall be charged to the EHPA.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Exercise of option; required amount in EHPA.</E> The Homebuyer may exercise his option to buy the Home, by paying the applicable purchase price pursuant to section 16 or 17, only after satisfying the following conditions precedent:</P>
              <P>(1) Within the first two years of his occupancy, he has achieved a balance in his EHPA equal to 20 times the amount of the monthly EHPA credit as initially determined in accordance with paragraph a of this section;</P>
              <P>(2) He has met, and is continuing to meet, the requirements of this Agreement;</P>
              <P>(3) He has rendered, and is continuing to render, satisfactory performance of his responsibilities to the HBA.</P>

              <P>When the Homebuyer has met these conditions precedent, the Authority shall give the Homebuyer a certificate to that effect. After achieving the required minimum EHPA balance within the first two years of his occupancy, the Homebuyer shall continue to be obligated to provide the required maintenance, thereby continuing to add to his EHPA. If the Homebuyer fails to meet either his obligation to achieve the minimum EHPA balance as specified or his obligation thereafter to continue adding to the EHPA, <PRTPAGE P="305"/>the Authority and the HBA shall investigate and take appropriate corrective action, including termination of this Agreement by the Authority in accordance with section 24.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Additional equity through other maintenance.</E> Besides the maintenance which the Homebuyer must provide pursuant to section 6, the Homebuyer may earn additional EHPA credits by providing in whole or in part any of the maintenance necessary to the common property of the Development or maintenance for which the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve is established (see section 11). Such maintenance may be provided by the Homebuyer and credit earned therefor only pursuant to a prior written agreement between the Homebuyer and the Authority (or the Homeowners Association, depending on who has responsibility for maintenance of the property involved), covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the Homebuyer is to receive. Upon completion of such work, the agreed amount shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and credited to the Homebuyer's EHPA.</P>
              <P>f. <E T="03">Investment of excess.</E> When the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the Authority shall notify the HBA and shall invest the excess in federally-insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD and in accordance with any recommendations made by the HBA. If the HBA wishes to participate in the investment program it should submit periodically to the Authority a list of HUD approved securities, bonds, or obligations which the HBA reecommends for investment by the Authority of the funds in the EHPAs. Interest earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each Homebuyer's EHPA in proportion to the amount in each such reserve account.</P>
              <P>Periodically, but not less often than semi-annually, the Authority shall prepare a statement showing: (1) the aggregate amount of all EHPA balances; (2) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs, and (3) the aggregate uninvested balance of all the Homebuyers' EHPAs. This statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</P>
              <P>g. <E T="03">Voluntary payments.</E> To enable the Homebuyer to acquire title to the Home within a shorter period, he may either periodically or in a lump sum voluntarily make payments over and above his required monthly payments. Such voluntary payments shall be deposited to his credit in his EHPA.</P>
              <P>h. <E T="03">Delinquent monthly payments.</E> Under exceptional circumstances as determined by the HBA and the Authority, the Homebuyer's EHPA may be used to pay his delinquent required monthly payments, provided the amount used for this purpose does not seriously deplete the account and provided that the Homebuyer agrees to cooperate in such counseling as may be made available by the Authority or the HBA.</P>
              <P>i. <E T="03">Annual statement to homebuyer.</E> The Authority shall provide an annual statement to the Homebuyer specifying at least (1) the amount in his EHPA, and (2) the amount in his Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the Authority which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve, shall be accounted for through a work order. The Homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his Home.</P>
              <P>j. <E T="03">Withdrawal and assignment.</E> The Homebuyer shall have no right to assign, withdraw, or in any way dispose of the funds in his EHPA except as provided in this section or in sections 16 and 17.</P>
              <P>k. <E T="03">Application of EHPA upon vacating of dwelling.</E> (1) In the event this Agreement is terminated or if the Homebuyer vacates the Home, the Authority shall charge against the Homebuyer's EHPA the amounts required to pay; (i) The amount due the Authority, including the monthly payments the Homebuyer is obligated to pay up to the date he vacates; (ii) the monthly payment for the period the Home is vacant, not to exceed 30 days from the date of notice of intention to vacate, or if the Homebuyer failed to give notice of intention to vacate, 30 days from the date the Home is put in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6; and (iii) the cost of any routine maintenance, and of any nonroutine maintenance attributable to the negligence of the Homebuyer, required to put the Home in good condition for the next occupant in conformity with section 6.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Homebuyer's EHPA balance is not sufficient to cover all of these charges, the Authority shall require the Homebuyer to pay the additional amount due. If the amount in the EHPA exceeds these charges, the excess shall be paid the Homebuyer.</P>

              <P>(3) Settlement with the Homebuyer shall be made promptly after the actual cost of repairs to the dwelling has been determined (see paragraph k(1)(iii) of this section), provided that the Authority shall make every effort to make such settlement within 30 days from the date the Homebuyer vacates. The Homebuyer may obtain a settlement within 7 days of the date he vacates, even though the actual cost of such repairs has not yet been determined, if he has given the Authority notice of intention to vacate 30 days prior to the date he vacates and if the amount to be charged against his EHPA for such repairs is based on the Authority's estimate of the cost thereof (determined after consultation with the appropriate representative of the HBA).<PRTPAGE P="306"/>
              </P>
              <P>11. <E T="03">Nonroutine maintenance reserve (NRMR)</E>—a. <E T="03">Purpose of reserve.</E> The Authority shall establish and maintain a separate nonroutine maintenance reserve (NRMR) for the Home, using a portion of the Homebuyer's monthly payment. The purpose of the NRMR is to provide funds for the nonroutine maintenance of the Home, which consists of the infrequent and costly items of maintenance and replacement shown on the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule for the Home (see paragraph b of this section). Such maintenance may include the replacement of dwelling equipment (such as range and refrigerator), replacement of roof, exterior painting, major repairs to heating and plumbing systems, etc. The NRMR shall not be used for nonroutine maintenance of common property, or for nonroutine maintenance relating to the Home to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the Homebuyer's negligence or to defective materials or workmanship.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Amount of reserve.</E> The amount of the monthly payments to be set aside for NRMR shall be determined by the Authority, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of the Nonroutine Maintenance Schedule showing the amount estimated to be needed for nonroutine maintenance of the Home during the term of this Agreement, taking into consideration the type of construction and dwelling equipment. This Schedule shall (1) list each item of nonroutine maintenance (e.g., range, refrigerator, plumbing, heating system, roofing, tile flooring, exterior painting, etc.), (2) show for each listed item the estimated frequency of maintenance or useful life before replacement, the estimated cost of maintenance or replacement (including installation) for each occasion, and the annual reserve requirement, and (3) show the total reserve requirements for all the listed items, on an annual and a monthly basis. This Schedule shall be prepared by the Authority and approved by HUD as part of the Submission required to determine the financial feasibility of the Project. The Schedule shall be revised after approval of the working drawings and specifications, and shall thereafter be reexamined annually in the light of changing economic conditions and experience.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Charges to reserve.</E> (1) The Authority shall provide the nonroutine maintenance necessary for the Home and the cost thereof shall be funded as provided in paragraph c(2) and c(3) of this section. Such maintenance may be provided by the Homebuyer but only pursuant to a prior written agreement with the Authority covering the nature and scope of the work and the amount of credit the Homebuyer is to receive. The amount of any credit shall, upon completion of the work, be credited to the Homebuyer's EHPA and charged as provided in paragraph c(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of nonroutine maintenance shall be charged to the NRMR for the Home except that (i) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to the fault or negligence of the Homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the Homebuyer's EHPA after consultation with the HBA if the Homebuyer disagrees, and (ii) to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, or even though covered by warranty if not paid for through no fault or negligence of the Homebuyer, the cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense account of the Project.</P>
              <P>(3) In the event the amount charged against the NRMR exceeds the balance therein, the difference (deficit) shall be made up from continuing monthly credits to the NRMR based upon the Homebuyer's monthly payments. If there is still a deficit when the Homebuyer acquires title, the Homebuyer shall pay such deficit at settlement.</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Transfer of NRMR.</E> (1) In the event this Agreement is terminated, the Homebuyer shall not receive any balance or be required to pay any deficit in the NRMR. When a subsequent Homebuyer moves in, the NRMR shall continue to be applicable to the Home in the same amount as if the preceding Homebuyer had continued in occupancy.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event the Homebuyer purchases the Home, and there remains a balance in the NRMR, the Authority shall pay such balance to the Homebuyer at settlement. In the event the Homebuyer purchases the Home and there is a deficit in the NRMR, the Homebuyer shall pay such deficit to the Authority at settlement.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Investment of excess.</E> (1) When the aggregate amount of the NRMR balances for all the Homes exceeds the estimated reserve requirements for 90 days, the Authority shall invest the excess in federally insured savings accounts, federally insured credit unions, and/or securities approved by HUD. Income earned on the investment of such funds shall be prorated and credited to each Homebuyer's NRMR in proportion to the amount in each reserve account.</P>
              <P>(2) Periodically, but not less often that semi-annually, the Authority shall prepare a statement showing (i) the aggregate amount of all NRMR balances, (ii) the aggregate amount of investments (savings accounts and/or securities) held for the account of the NRMR and (iii) the aggregate uninvested balance of the NRMRs. A copy of this statement shall be made available to any authorized representative of the HBA.</P>
              <P>12. <E T="03">Operating reserve</E>—a. <E T="03">Purpose of reserve.</E> To the extent that total operating receipts (including subsidies for operations) exceeds total operating expenditures of the Project, the LHA shall establish an operating reserve <PRTPAGE P="307"/>up to the maximum approved by HUD in connection with its approval of the annual operating budgets for the Project. The purpose of this reserve is to provide funds for (1) the infrequent but costly items of nonroutine maintenance and replacements of common property, taking into consideration the types of items which constitute common property, such as nondwelling structures and equipment, and, in certain cases, common elements of dwelling structures, (2) nonroutine maintenance for the Homes to the extent such maintenance is attributable to defective materials or workmanship not covered by warranty, (3) working capital for payment of a deficit in a Homebuyer's NRMR, until such deficit is offset by future monthly payments by the Homebuyer or at settlement in the event the Homebuyer should purchase, and (4) a deficit in the operation of the Project for a fiscal year, including a deficit resulting from monthly payments totaling less than the break-even amount for the Project.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Nonroutine maintenance</E>—_____ <E T="03">common property (contribution to operating reserve).</E> The amount under this heading to be included in operating expense (and in the break-even amount) established for the fiscal year (see sections 8 and 9) shall be determined by the Authority, with the approval of HUD, on the basis of estimates of the monthly amount needed to accumulate an adequate reserve for the items described in paragraph a(1) of this section. This amount shall be subject to revision in the light of experience. This contribution to the Operating Reserve shall be made only during the period the Authority is responsible for the maintenance of any common property; and during such period, the amount shall be determined on the basis of the requirements of all common property in the Development in a manner similar to that explained in Section 9. When the Operating Reserve reaches the maximum authorized in paragraph c of this Section, the break-even (monthly operating expense) computations (see Sections 8 and 9) for the next and succeeding fiscal years need not include a provision for this contribution to the Operating Reserve unless the balance of the Reserve is reduced below the maximum during any such succeeding fiscal year.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Maximum operating reserve.</E> The maximum operating reserve that may be retained by the Authority at the end of any fiscal year shall be the sum of (1) one-half of total routine expense included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year and (2) one-third of total break-even amounts included in the operating budget approved for the next fiscal year; provided that such maximum may be increased if necessary as determined or approved by HUD. Total routine expense means the sum of the amounts budgeted for administration, homebuyer services. Authority-supplied utilities, routine maintenance of common property, protective services, and general expense or other category of day-to-day routine expense (see section 9 above for explanation of various categories of expense).</P>
              <P>d. <E T="03">Transfer to Homeowners Association.</E> The Authority shall be responsible for and shall retain custody of the Operating Reserve until the Homeowners acquire voting control of the Homeowners Association (see sections 21c and 22f). When the Homeowners acquire voting control, the Homeowners Association shall then assume full responsibility for management and maintenance of common property under a plan approved by HUD, and there shall be transferred to the Homeowners Association a portion of the Operating Reserve then held by the Authority, as determined by the Authority with the approval of HUD.</P>
              <P>e. <E T="03">Disposition of reserve.</E> If, at the end of a fiscal year, there is an excess over the maximum Operating Reserve, this excess shall be applied to the operating deficit of the Project, if any, and any remainder shall be paid to HUD. Following the end of the fiscal year in which the last Home has been conveyed by the Authority, the balance of the Operating Reserve held by the Authority shall be paid to HUD, provided that the aggregate amount of payments by the Authority under this paragraph shall not exceed the aggregate amount of annual contributions paid by HUD with respect to the Project.</P>
              <P>13. <E T="03">Annual statement and copies of work orders to homebuyer.</E> a. The Authority shall maintain books of accounts and provide a statement at least annually to each Homebuyer which will show (i) the amount in his EHPA, and (2) the amount in the NRMR for his Home.</P>
              <P>b. During the year, any maintenance or repair done on the dwelling by the Authority, which is chargeable to the EHPA or to the NRMR shall be accounted for through a work order. The Homebuyer shall receive a copy of all such work orders for his Home.</P>
              <P>14. <E T="03">Insurance.</E> a. Until transfer of title to the Homebuyer, the Authority shall carry all insurance prescribed by HUD including fire and extended coverage insurance upon the Home in such form and amount and with such company or companies as it determines. The Authority shall not carry any insurance on the Homebuyer's furniture, clothing, automobile, or any other personal property, or personal liability insurance covering the Homebuyer.</P>

              <P>b. In the event the Home is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, the Authority shall consult with the Homebuyer as to whether the Home shall be repaired or rebuilt. If the Authority determines that the Home should not be repaired or rebuilt but the Homebuyer disagrees, the matter shall be submitted to HUD for final determination. If the final determination is that the <PRTPAGE P="308"/>Home should not be repaired or rebuilt, the Authority shall terminate this Agreement upon reasonable notice to the Homebuyer. In such case, the Homebuyer shall be paid the balance in his EHPA and (to assist him in connection with relocation expenses) the balance in his NRMR, less amounts, if any, due from him to the Authority, including Monthly Payments he may be obligated to pay.</P>
              <P>c. In the event of termination or if the Home must be vacated during the repair period, the Authority will use its best efforts to assist in relocating the Homebuyer. If the Home must be vacated during the repair period, Monthly Payments shall be suspended during the vacancy period.</P>
              <P>15. <E T="03">Eligibility for continued occupancy.</E> a. The Homebuyer shall cease to be eligible for continued occupancy with the aid of HUD annual contributions when the Authority determines the Homebuyer's adjusted monthly income has reached, and is likely to continue at, a level at which the Homebuyer's total payment equals or exceeds the monthly housing cost (see paragraph b of this section). In such an event, if the Authority determines, with HUD approval, that suitable financing is available, the Authority shall notify the Homebuyer that he or she must either: (1) Purchase the Home; or (2) move from the Development. If, however, the Authority determines that, because of special circumstances, the family is unable to find decent, safe and sanitary housing within the family's financial reach although making every reasonable effort to do so, the family may be permitted to remain for the duration of such a situation if it pays as rent a monthly payment consistent with its adjusted monthly income, in accordance with applicable HUD regulations prescribing rental payments for families in housing assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Such a monthly payment shall also be payable by the family if it continues in occupancy without purchasing the home because suitable financing is not available.</P>
              <P>b. The term “monthly housing cost,” as used in this section means the sum of: (1) The monthly debt service amount shown on the Purchase Price Schedule (except where the Homebuyer can purchase the Home by the method described in section 16 below); (2) one-twelfth of the annual real property taxes which the Homebuyer will be required to pay as a Homeowner; (3) one-twelfth of the annual premium attributable to fire and extended coverage insurance carried by the Authority with respect to the Home; (4) the current monthly per unit amount budgeted for routine maintenance (EHPA) and routine maintenance-common property; and (5) the current Authority and HUD approved monthly allowance for utilities paid for directly by the Homebuyer plus the monthly cost of utilities supplied by the Authority.</P>
              <P>16. <E T="03">Achievement of ownership by initial homebuyer</E>—a. <E T="03">Determination of initial purchase price.</E> The Authority shall determine the initial purchase prices of the Homes by two basic steps, as follows:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Step 1.</E> The Authority shall take the Estimated Total Development Cost (including the full amount for contingencies as authorized by HUD) of the Development as shown in the Development Cost Budget in effect upon award of the Main Construction Contract or execution of the Contract of Sale, and shall deduct therefrom the amounts, if any, attributed to (1) relocation costs, (2) counseling and training costs, and (3) the cost of any community, administration or management facilities including the land, equipment and furnishings attributable to such facilities as set forth in the development program for the Development.</P>
              <P>The resulting amount is herein called Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Step 2.</E> The Authority shall apportion the Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers among all the Homes in the Development. This apportionment shall be made by obtaining an FHA appraisal of each Home, and adjusting such appraised values (upward or downward) by the percentage difference between the total of the appraisal for all the Homes and the Estimated Total Development Cost for Homebuyers. The adjusted amount for each Home shall be the Initial Purchase Price for that Home.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Purchase Price Schedule.</E> The Homebuyer shall be provided with a Purchase Price Schedule showing (1) the monthly declining purchase price over a 30-year period, <SU>3</SU>
                <FTREF/> commencing with the initial purchase price on the first day of the month following the effective date of this Agreement and (2) the monthly debt service amount upon which the Schedule is based. This Schedule and debt service amount shall be computed on the basis of the initial purchase price, a 30-year period, <SU>3</SU> and a rate of interest equal to the minimum loan interest rate as specified in the Annual Contributions Contract for the Project on the date of HUD approval of the Development Cost Budget, described in paragraph a of this section, rounded up, if necessary, to the next multiple of one-fourth of one percent (<FR>1/4</FR> percent).</P>
              <FTNT>
                <P>
                  <SU>3</SU> Change to 25-year period where appropriate pursuant to § 904.101(b)(3) of this subpart.</P>
              </FTNT>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Methods of Purchase.</E> (1) The Homebuyer may achieve ownership when the amount in his EHPA, plus such portion of the NRMR as he wishes to use for the purchase, is equal to the purchase price as shown at that time on his Purchase Price Schedule plus all Incidental Costs (“Incidental Costs” means the <PRTPAGE P="309"/>costs incidental to acquiring ownership, including, but not limited to, the costs for a credit report, field survey title examination, title insurance, and inspections, the fees for attorneys other than the LHA's attorney, mortgage application and organization, closing and recording, and the transfer taxes and loan discount payment if any). If for any reason title to the Home is not conveyed to the Homebuyer during the month in which such circumstances occur, the purchase price shall be fixed at the amount specified for such month and the Homebuyer shall be refunded (i) the net additions, if any, credited to his EHPA subsequent to such month, and (ii) such part of the monthly payments made by the Homebuyer after the purchase price has been fixed which exceeds the sum of the break-even amount attributable to the Home and the interest portion of the debt service shown in the Purchase Price Schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the sum of the purchase price and Incidental Costs is greater than the amounts in the Homebuyer's EHPA and NRMR, the Homebuyer may achieve ownership by obtaining financing for or otherwise paying the excess amount. The purchase price shall be the amount shown on his Purchase Price Schedule for the month in which the settlement date for the purchase occurs.</P>
              <P>d. The maximum period for achieving ownership shall be 30 years, but depending upon increases in the Homebuyer's income and the amount of credit which the Homebuyer can accumulate through maintenance and voluntary payments, the period may be shortened accordingly.</P>
              <P>17. <E T="03">Achievement of Ownership by Subsequent Homebuyer</E>—a. <E T="03">Definition.</E> In the event the initial Homebuyer and his family vacate the Home before having acquired ownership, a subsequent occupant who enters into a Homebuyer's Ownership Opportunity Agreement and who is not a successor pursuant to section 25 is herein called “Subsequent Homebuyer.”</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Determination of Initial Purchase Price.</E> The initial purchase price for a subsequent Homebuyer shall be an amount equal to (1) the purchase price shown in the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule as of the date of this Agreement with the subsequent Homebuyer plus (2) the amount, if any, by which the appraised fair market value of the Home determined or approved by HUD as of the same date, exceeds the purchase price specified in (1). In the event such appraised value has not been determined by the date of execution of this Agreement, the amount of the Initial Purchase Price shall be inserted in part I, section D after this determination has been made, with appropriate initialling or signing by the parties.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Purchase Price Schedule.</E> The Subsequent Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be the same as the unexpired portion of the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule except that where his purchase price includes an additional amount as specified in paragraph b(2) of this section, the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule shall be followed by an Additional Purchase Price Schedule for such additional amount based upon the same monthly debt service and the same interest rate as applied to the initial Homebuyer's Purchase Price Schedule.</P>
              <P>18. <E T="03">Transfer of Title to Homebuyer.</E> When the Homebuyer is to obtain ownership, a closing date shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. On the closing date, the Homebuyer shall pay the required amount of money to the Authority, sign the promissory note pursuant to section 19, and receive a deed for the Home.</P>
              <P>19. <E T="03">Payment Upon Resale at Profit</E>—a. <E T="03">Promissory Note.</E> (1) When a Homebuyer (whether Initial or Subsequent Homebuyer) achieves ownership, he shall sign a note obligating him to make a payment to the Authority, subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the event he resells his Home at a profit within 5 years of actual residence in the Home after he becomes a Homeowner. If, however, the Homeowner should purchase and occupy another Home within one year (18 months in case of a newly constructed home) of the resale of the Turnkey III Home, the Authority shall refund to the Homeowner the amount previously paid by him under the note, less the amount, if any, by which the resale price of the Turnkey III Home exceeds the acquisition price of the new home, provided that application for such refund shall be made no later than 30 days after the date of acquisition of the new home.</P>

              <P>(2) The note to be signed by the Homebuyer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be secured by a second mortgage. The initial amount of the note shall be computed by taking the appraised value of the Home at the time the Homebuyer becomes a Homeowner and subtracting (i) the Homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs and (ii) the increase in value of the Home, determined by appraisal, caused by improvements paid for by the Homebuyer with funds from sources other than the EHPA or NRMR. The note shall provide that this initial amount shall be automatically reduced by 20 percent thereof at the end of each year of residency as Homeowner, with the note terminating at the end of the five-year period of residency, as determined by the Authority. To protect the Homeowner, the note shall provide that the amount payable under it shall in no event be more than the net profit on the resale, that is, the amount by which the resale price exceeds the sum of (i) the Homebuyer's purchase price plus the Incidental Costs, (ii) the costs of the resale, including commissions and mortgage prepayment penalties, if any, and (iii) the increase in value of the Home, determined by appraisal, resulting <PRTPAGE P="310"/>from improvements paid for by him as a Homebuyer (with funds other than from the EHPA or NRMR) or as a Homeowner.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Residency requirements.</E> The five-year note periods does not end if the Homeowner rents or otherwise does not use the Home as his principal place of residence for any period within the first five years after he achieves ownership. Only the actual amount of time he is in residence is counted and the note shall be in effect until a total of five years time of residence has elapsed, at which time the Homeowner may request the Authority to release him from the note, and the Authority shall do so.</P>
              <P>20. <E T="03">Responsibilities of Homeowner.</E> After acquisition of ownership, the Homeowner shall pay to the Authority or to the Homeowners Association, as appropriate, a monthly fee for (a) the maintenance and operation of community facilities including utility facilities, if any, (b) the maintenance of grounds and other common areas, and (c) such other purpose as determined by the Authority or the Homeowners Association, as appropriate, including taxes and a provision for a reserve.</P>

The Authority shall not lose its majority voting interest in the Association as soon as a majority of the Homes have been conveyed, unless the law of the state requires control to be transferred at a particular time or the Authority so desires.

Under this weighted voting plan, the Authority will continue to have voting control until 75 percent of the Homes have been acquired by Homeowners.

Under this plan, the Authority will continue to have voting control until units representing 75 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by Homeowners. However, at its discretion the Authority may transfer voting control to the Homeowners when units representing at least 50 percent of the value of all units have been acquired by the Homeowners.</P>
              <P>23. <E T="03">Relationship of Homeowners Association to Homebuyers Association.</E> The Homebuyers Association and the Authority may make arrangements with the Homeowners Association to permit Homebuyers to participate in Homeowners Association matters which affect the Homebuyers. Such arrangements may include rights to attend meetings and to participate in Homeowners Association deliberations and decisions.</P>
              <P>24. <E T="03">Termination of Agreement</E>—a. <E T="03">Termination by the Authority</E>—(1) In the event the Homebuyer should breach this Agreement by failure to make a required Monthly Payment within 10 days after its due date, by misrepresentation or withholding of information in applying for admission or in connection with any subsequent reexamination of income and family composition, or by failure to comply with any other Homebuyer obligation under this Agreement, the Authority may terminate this Agreement 30 days after giving the Homebuyer notice of its intention to do so in accordance with paragraph (2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Notice of termination by the Authority shall be in writing. Such notice shall state (i) the reason for termination, (ii) that the Homebuyer may respond to the Authority, in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable period of time regarding the reason for termination, (iii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice, including a representative of the HBA, (iv) that the Authority will consult the HBA concerning the termination, and (v) that, unless the Authority rescinds or modifies the notice, the termination will be effective at the end of the 30-day notice period.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Termination by the Homebuyer.</E> The Homebuyer may terminate this Agreement by giving the Authority 30 days notice in writing of his intention to terminate and to vacate the Home. In the event that the Homebuyer vacates the Home without notice to the Authority, this Agreement shall be terminated automatically and the Authority may dispose of, in any manner deemed suitable by it, any items of personal property left by the Homebuyer in the Home.</P>
              <P>c. <E T="03">Transfer to rental unit.</E> (1) Inasmuch as the Homebuyer was found eligible for admission to the Project on the basis of having the necessary elements, of potential for Homeownership, continuation of eligibility requires continuation of this potential, subject only to temporary unforeseen changes in circumstances. The standards of potential for Homeownership are the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Income sufficient to result in a required monthly payment which is not less than the sum of the amounts necessary to pay the EHPA, the NRMR, and the estimated average monthly cost of utilities attributable to the Home;</P>
              <P>(ii) Ability to meet all the obligations of a Homebuyer under the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement;</P>
              <P>(iii) At least one member gainfully employed, or having an established source of continuing income.</P>
              <P>(2) Accordingly, in the event it should develop that the Homebuyer no longer meets one or more of these elements of Homeownership potential, the Authority shall investigate the circumstances and provide such counseling and assistance as may be feasible in order to help the family overcome the deficiency as promptly as possible. After a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the investigation, the Authority shall make a re-evaluation as to whether the family has regained the potential for Homeownership or is likely to do so within a further reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days from the date of the re-evaluation. Further extension of time may be granted in exceptional cases, but in any event a final determination shall be made no later than 90 days from the date of evaluation of the results of the initial investigation. The Authority shall invite the HBA to participate in all investigations and evaluations.</P>

              <P>(3) If the final determination of the Authority, after considering the views of the HBA, is that the Homebuyer should be transferred to a suitable dwelling unit in an Authority rental project, the Authority shall give the Homebuyer written notice of the Authority determination of the loss of Homeownership potential and of the offer of transfer to a rental unit. The notice shall state that the transfer shall occur as soon as a suitable rental unit is available for occupancy but no earlier than 30 days from the date of the notice, provided that an eligible successor for the Homebuyer unit has been selected by the Authority. The notice shall also state that if the Homebuyer should refuse to move under such circumstances, the family may be required to vacate the Homebuyer unit, without further notice. The notice shall include a statement (i) that the Homebuyer may respond to the Authority in writing or in person, within a specified reasonable time, regarding the reason for the determination and offer of transfer, (ii) that in such response he may be represented or accompanied by a person of his choice including a representative of the HBA, and (iii) that the Authority has consulted the HBA concerning this determination and offer of transfer.<PRTPAGE P="312"/>

              <P>(4) When a Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement is terminated pursuant to this paragraph 24c, the amount in the Homebuyer's EHPA shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 10k of this Agreement.</P>
              <P>25. <E T="03">Survivorship.</E> (1) In the event of death, mental incapacity or abandonment of the family by the Homebuyer, the person designated as the successor in part I of this Agreement shall succeed to the rights and responsibilities under the Agreement if that person is an occupant of the Home at the time of the event and is determined by the Authority to meet all of the standards of potential for homeownership as set forth in section 24a. This designation may be changed by the Homebuyer at any time. If there is no such designation or the designee is no longer an occupant of the Home or does not meet the standards of potential for homeownership, the Authority may consider as the Homebuyer any family member who was in occupancy at the time of the event and who meets the standards of potential for homeownership.</P>
              <P>(2) If there is no qualified successor in accordance with the above, the Authority shall terminate the Agreement and another family shall be selected, except under the following circumstances: where a minor child or children of the Homebuyer family are in occupancy, then in order to protect their continued occupancy and opportunity for acquisition of ownership of the Home, the Authority may approve as occupants of the unit, an appropriate adult(s) who has been appointed legal guardian of the children with a duty to perform the obligations of the Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreement in their interest and behalf.</P>
              <P>26. <E T="03">Nonassignability and Use of Reserves and Accounts</E>—a. <E T="03">Nonassignability.</E> The Homebuyer shall not assign this Agreement, or assign, mortgage or pledge any right or interest in the Home or in this Agreement including any right or interest in any reserve or account, except with the prior written approval of the Authority and HUD.</P>
              <P>b. <E T="03">Use of Reserves and Accounts.</E> It is understood and agreed that the Homebuyer shall have no right to receive or use the money in any reserve or account created pursuant to this Agreement except for the limited purposes and under the special circumstances set forth by the terms of this Agreement. It is further understood and agreed that both the Authority and HUD have a financial and a governmental interest in the Earned Home Payments Account and other reserves as security for the financial integrity of the Development, as a means of savings in cost to the Government by minimizing the amount and period over which HUD annual contributions must be paid, and as a means of advancing the public interest and welfare by assisting low-income families to achieve homeownership.</P>
              <P>27. <E T="03">Notices.</E> Any notice required hereunder or by law shall be sufficient if delivered in writing to the Homebuyer personally or to an adult member of his family residing in the dwelling unit or if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, properly addressed to the Homebuyer, postage prepaid. Notice to the Authority shall be in writing, and either delivered to any Authority employee at the office of the Authority or sent to the Authority by certified mail, properly addressed, postage prepaid.</P>
              <P>28. <E T="03">Grievance Procedure.</E> All grievances or appeals arising under this Agreement shall be processed and resolved pursuant to the grievance procedure of the Authority, which procedure shall provide for participation of the HBA in the grievance process. This grievance procedure shall be posted in the Authority's Office.</P>

              <P>The purpose of the counseling and training program shall be to assure that the homebuyers, individually and collectively through their homebuyers association (HBA), will be more capable of dealing with situations with which they may be confronted, making decisions related to these situations, and understanding and accepting the responsibility and consequences that accompany those decisions.</P>

              <P>The counseling and training program should seek to achieve the following objectives:</P>
              <P>(a) Enable the potential homebuyer to have a full understanding of the responsibilities that accompany his participation in the Homeownership Opportunity Program;</P>
              <P>(b) Enable the potential homebuyer to have an understanding of homeownership tasks with specific training given to individuals as the need and readiness for counseling or training indicates;</P>
              <P>(c) Assure that the role of the HBA is understood and plans for its organization are initiated at the earliest practical time;</P>
              <P>(d) Develop an understanding of the role of the LHA and of the need for a cooperative relationship between the homebuyer and the LHA;</P>
              <P>(e) Encourage the development of self-help by the homebuyer through reducing dependency and increasing independent action;</P>
              <P>(f) Develop an understanding of mutual assistance and cooperation that will develop a feeling of self-respect, pride and community responsibility;</P>
              <P>(g) Develop local resources that can be of assistance to the individual and the community on an on-going basis.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Planning.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The counseling and training program shall be flexible and responsive to the needs of each prospective homebuyer. While many subjects lend themselves to group sessions, consideration shall be given to individual counseling. Individuals should not be required to attend training classes on subject matter they are familiar with unless they can actively participate in the instruction process.</P>

              <P>(b) The program may be provided by contract with an outside organization, or by the LHA staff, in either case with <PRTPAGE P="314"/>voluntary involvement and assistance of groups and individuals within the community. It is essential that the training entity be completely knowledgeable and supportive of the entire Homeownership Opportunity Program. It may be recognized that most of the objectives stated require specialized instructional skill and content knowledge. There shall be recognition of the differences in communication and in value systems, and an understanding and respect for past experience of the individual. Maximum possible use shall be made of indigenous trainers to insure good communication and rapport. Special attention shall be directed to the needs of working members of the family for counseling and training sessions to be held where and during the time they can attend. Where the services of outside contractors are utilized, there shall be a close working relationship with the LHA and a program for phasing in LHA staff who will have the on-going responsibility for the program. The value of local agencies, educational institutions, etc., for implementing the program rather than an outside firm shall be carefully considered since the continuing presence of such agencies and institutions in the community can often develop into an on-going resource beyond the contract period.</P>
              <P>(c) In planning a homeownership counseling and training program, whether self-administered or contracted, the LHA shall consult with HUD for advice and information on programs, qualified contractors, local resources, reasonable costs, and other similar matters.</P>
              <P>(d) Where the program is to be contracted to an outside group, proposals shall be secured either by public advertising or by sending requests for proposals to a number of competent public or private organizations.</P>
              <P>(e) In areas where there are large concentrations of homebuyers who do not read, write, or understand English fluently, the native language of the people shall be used. If feasible all instructional materials shall be in both languages.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General requirements and information.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The counseling and training program shall be designed to meet the needs of the homebuyers and be sufficiently flexible to meet new needs as they arise. The nature of the program suggests four phases of counseling: (1) Pre-occupancy; (2) move-in; (3) post-occupancy; (4) assistance to the HBA. While some elements of the program lend themselves more to one phase than another, the program areas shall be coordinated and interrelated. It is recommended that the entity providing these services work closely with the participants and ensure that policies established are agreeable to both the LHA and the homebuyer.</P>
              <P>(b) The following is a description of major elements of the program which experience thus far has shown to be relevant. More detailed information is set forth in Appendix I, “Content Guide for Counseling and Training Program.”</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Pre-occupancy phase.</E> The purpose of this phase is to prepare the selected families to assume the responsibilities of homeownership, and to provide an opportunity for the LHA and each family to reassess the family's potential for successful participation in the homeownership development.</P>
              <P>(i) An overload of information should be avoided in this phase since many of the subjects will be dealt with in greater depth after the family is in occupancy, and experience has shown that much of the information will be more relevant at that time.</P>
              <P>(ii) This phase should be completed for each family before the beginning of its occupancy.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Move-in phase.</E> During this phase, the counseling and training staff should be available to the homebuyers on an individual basis. Services may include (i) inspecting the units, interior and exterior, with the homebuyers and a representative of the LHA, (ii) testing appliances and equipment, (iii) providing information on the moving process (packing, trucks, etc.), and (iv) assisting homebuyers in making adjustments occasioned by the move, serving as liaison among homebuyers, LHA, builder and other agencies, and assisting homebuyers in meeting new neighbors.<PRTPAGE P="315"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Post-occupancy phase.</E> Before this phase begins, a period (possibly one month) should elapse to allow homebuyers an opportunity to adjust to their new surroundings. This is a time when new questions and problems come to light that can be dealt with in further counseling and training. This phase should be designed to cover many of the same basic subjects as the pre-occupancy phase, both by review and refresher where necessary but in much greater depth.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Assistance to the HBA.</E> The parties responsible for the counseling and training program shall be responsible for the formation, incorporation, and development of the HBA, including the execution of the Recognition Agreement between the LHA and HBA, as provided in subpart D of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Training methodology.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Equal in importance to the content of the pre- and post-occupancy training is the training methodology. Because groups vary, there should be adaptability in the communication and learning experience. Methods to be utilized may include group presentations, small discussion groups, special classes, and workshops. Especially important to a successful program are individual family home visits for discussion and instruction on unique problems and operation of equipment.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Funding.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Source of funds.</E> For purpose of funding counseling and training pursuant to this subpart and for establishing the HBA, the LHA shall include an amount equal to $500 per dwelling unit in the development cost budget. If additional funds should be needed for any of these purposes, the LHA with the assistance of the CPC, if any, shall explore all other possible sources of services and funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Planned use of $500-per-unit funds.</E> These funds are to be used to pay for:</P>
              <P>(1) Pre- and post-occupancy counseling and training;</P>
              <P>(2) Establishment and initial operation of the HBA (for operation in the management phase, see § 904.305).</P>
              <FP>In planning the use of these funds, the LHA shall recognize that for a number of years after the initial counseling and training there is likely to be some turnover and follow-up counseling and training needs. Therefore, the LHA shall limit the amounts for the counseling and training of the initial homebuyers and shall reserve a reasonable amount for future counseling and training needs during the management phase of the development.</FP>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Period of availability of $500-per-unit funds.</E> These funds shall be available during the development phase, and a specific amount shall be set aside, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, to be used for ongoing needs after the close of the development period.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Budgeting of $500-per-unit funds.</E> (1) The Development Cost Budget submitted with the Development Program shall include an estimated amount for counseling and training program costs. However, such costs shall not be incurred until after HUD approval of the counseling and training program.</P>
              <P>(2) Upon HUD approval of the counseling and training program, the LHA shall include the approved amount in its Contract Award Development Cost Budget. This amount shall constitute the maximum amount that may be included for such purposes in the project development cost; provided that, if the approved amount is less than $500 per dwelling unit, it may, if necessary, be amended with HUD approval, but not later than the Final Development Cost Budget and subject to the $500-per-unit limitation.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Application for approval of counseling and training program.</E> (1) The LHA shall submit an application for approval of a counseling and training program and for approval of funds therefor. This application shall be submitted to HUD at the time of the submission of the development program or as soon thereafter as possible but no later than the submission of the working drawings and specifications.</P>

              <P>(2) The application shall include a narrative statement outlining the counseling and training program, including any services and funds to be obtained from other sources, together with copies of any proposed contract and other pertinent documents. This statement shall include the following:<PRTPAGE P="316"/>

              <P>(a) It is essential that the homebuyers have an organized vehicle for pursuing their common interests, for effectively representing the needs of residents in dealing with the LHA, and for undertaking eventual management responsibility for the development. Although this organization, called the homebuyers association (HBA), shall be representative of the homebuyers and independent of the LHA, it shall be the responsibility of the LHA and the training and counseling staff to assist the homebuyers in their initial efforts at organization.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as noted in § 904.307, each Turnkey III development shall have an HBA. There shall be a separate HBA for each development or developments where there is a physical and financial community of interest.</P>

              <P>(a) The HBA should be organized and incorporated as early in the life of the development as is feasible, in order to allow selected homebuyers an opportunity to meet each other and begin forging a sense of community, but in any case the HBA shall be organized and incorporated no later than the date on which 50 percent of the homebuyers have been selected. Interim officers and directors shall be designated as part of the initial organization of the HBA to serve until full-term officers and directors are elected. Such full-term officers and directors shall be elected when 60 percent of the homebuyers are in occupancy, but, in any event, not later than one year from the date the first home is occupied.</P>
              <P>(b) The LHA, in cooperation with the CPC, if any, shall be responsible for assuring that competent counseling and training assistance pursuant to Subpart C of this part will be provided in organizing the HBA. These services shall be continued until the HBA is fully operational.</P>
              <P>(c) The provision of such services shall include at least the following functions:</P>

              <P>(4) Assisting in the formation of the organization, including such things as the initial designation of interim officers and directors and subsequent election of full-term HBA officers and directors, and the establishment of necessary committees, if any.</P>
              <P>(d) The LHA and the HBA shall execute an agreement recognizing the HBA as the official representative of the homebuyers, and establishing the functions, rights, and responsibilities of both parties (see Appendix II). This agreement shall be executed as soon as possible after incorporation of the HBA.</P>

              <P>(3) Recommending policies and rules to the LHA for operation and management including rules concerning use of the common areas and community facilities;</P>
              <P>(4) Participating in the operation of official grievance mechanisms;</P>
              <P>(5) Advising and assisting its members regarding procedures and practices relative to the Earned Home Payments Account and the acquisition of homeownership;</P>
              <P>(6) Participating with the LHA in periodic maintenance inspections of homes after occupancy, and making recommendations in case of disagreements arising out of maintenance inspections;</P>
              <P>(7) Participating with the LHA in the selection of subsequent homebuyers;</P>
              <P>(8) Coordinating, supervising, or managing the operation of credit union, child care, or other supportive services established for the development;</P>
              <P>(9) Participating with the LHA in the establishment and implementation of policies related to collection of monthly payments, termination of occupancy, and resolution of hardship situations; and</P>

              <P>(a) In addition to providing the HBA with noncash contributions such as office space and duplicating services, the LHA shall make cash contributions for operating expenses of the HBA, in the amount provided for in paragraph (b) of this section. Until the project goes into management, these contributions shall be made from the development funds budgeted for the counseling and training program (see § 904.206). Thereafter, these contributions shall be provided for in the annual operating budgets of the LHA.</P>
              <P>(b) The cash contributions pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be in the amount provided for in the LHA budget (development cost budget or annual operating budget, as the case may be) and approved by HUD. Such contributions shall be subject to whatever restrictions are applied by HUD to the funding of tenant councils generally, but they shall not exceed $3 per year per dwelling unit; provided that as an incentive to the HBA to provide additional funds from other sources such as homebuyer's dues, contributions, revenues from special projects or activities, etc., the LHA shall, to the extent approved by HUD in the LHA budget, match such additional funds beyond the $3 up to a maximum of $4.50, for a total LHA share of $7.50 where the total funding for the HBA is $12 or more. The HBA shall not be precluded from seeking to achieve total funding in excess of $12 per unit where this can be done with additional funds from sources other than the LHA. Furthermore, funding by the LHA for the normal expenses of the HBA is not to be confused with fees paid pursuant to management services contracts as described in § 904.306.</P>

              <P>The LHA may also contract with the HBA to perform some or all of the functions of project management for which the HBA may be better suited or located than the LHA. Such functions <PRTPAGE P="319"/>may include security, maintenance of common property, or collection of monthly payments. For this purpose, the HBA may form a management corporation and the officers of the HBA shall be the directors of such corporation. This corporation and the LHA shall then negotiate a management services contract. Such arrangements are consistent with the objective of providing for maximum participation by residents in the management of their developments. As an alternative, the HBA and the LHA may elect to undertake any other arrangement approved by HUD.</P>

For such cases, a modified form of homebuyers association may be called for or a less formal organization may be desirable. This decision shall be made jointly by the LHA and the homebuyers, acting on the recommendation of HUD.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 905.100</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Purpose, general description, and other requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Public Housing Capital Fund Program (Capital Fund Program or CFP) provides financial assistance to public housing agencies (PHAs) and resident management corporations (RMC) (pursuant to 24 CFR 964.225) to make improvements to existing public housing. The CFP also provides financial assistance to develop public housing, including mixed-finance developments that contain public housing units.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">General description.</E> Congress appropriates amounts for the Capital Fund in HUD's annual appropriations. In order to receive a Capital Fund grant, the PHA must:</P>
              <P>(1) Validate project-level information in HUD's data systems, as prescribed by HUD;</P>
              <P>(2) Have an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan;</P>

              <P>(3) Enter into a Capital Fund Annual Contributions Contract (CF ACC) <PRTPAGE P="326"/>Amendment to the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract (as defined in 24 CFR 5.403) with HUD; and</P>
              <P>(4) Provide a written certification and counsel's opinion that all property receiving Capital Fund assistance is under a currently effective Declaration of Trust (DOT) and is in compliance with the CF ACC and the Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Informational requirements.</E> Section 905.300 of this part describes the information to be submitted to HUD for the CFP. HUD uses the CF formula set forth in § 905.400 of this part, along with data provided by the PHA and other information, including, but not limited to, the high-performance information from the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) and location cost indices, to determine each PHA's annual grant amount. HUD notifies each PHA of the amount of the grant and provides a CF ACC Amendment that must be signed by the PHA and executed by HUD in order for the PHA to access the grant. After HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment, the PHA may draw down funds for eligible costs that have been described in its CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report or CFP 5-Year Action Plan.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Eligible activities.</E> Eligible Capital Fund costs and activities as further described in subpart B of this part include, but are not limited to, making physical improvements to the public housing stock and developing public housing units to be added to the existing inventory. With HUD approval, a PHA may also leverage its public housing inventory by borrowing additional capital on the private market and pledging a portion of its annual Capital Funds for debt service, in accordance with § 905.500 of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Obligation and expenditure requirements.</E> A PHA must obligate and expend its Capital Funds in accordance with § 905.306 of this part. The PHA will directly employ labor, either temporarily or permanently, to perform work (force account) or contract for the required work in accordance with 2 CFR part 200”. Upon completion of the work, the PHA must submit an Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) and a final Performance and Evaluation Report (in accordance with § 905.322 of this part) to HUD to close out each Capital Fund grant.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Financing and development.</E> Section 905.500 of this part regulates financing activities using Capital Funds and Operating Funds. Section 905.600 of this part contains the development requirements, including those related to mixed-finance development, formerly found in 24 CFR part 941. Section 905.700 of this part describes the criteria for the use of Capital Funds for other security interests. Section 905.800 of this part addresses PHA compliance with Capital Fund requirements and HUD capability for review and sanction for noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Protections for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking.</E> Public housing agencies must apply the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, to mixed finance developments covered under § 905.604.</P>
              <CITA>[78 FR 63770, Oct. 24, 2013, as amended at 80 FR 75942, Dec. 7, 2015; 81 FR 80815, Nov. 16, 2016]</CITA>

              <SUBJECT>Emergencies and natural disasters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> PHAs are required by the CF ACC to carry various types of insurance to protect it from loss. In most cases, insurance coverage will be the primary source of funding to pay repair or replacement costs associated with emergencies and natural disasters. Where the Department's Annual Appropriations Act establishes a set-aside from the Capital Fund appropriation for emergencies and natural disasters, the procedures in this section apply.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Emergencies and natural disasters.</E> An emergency is an unforeseen or unpreventable event or occurrence that poses an immediate threat to the health and safety of the residents that must be corrected within one year of funding. A natural disaster for purposes of the Capital Fund reserve, is a non-presidentially declared disaster. In the event an emergency or natural disaster arises, HUD may require a PHA to use any other source that may legally be available, including unobligated Capital Funds, prior to providing emergency or natural disaster funds from the set-aside. The Department will review, on a case-by-case basis, requests for emergency and natural disaster funding from PHAs.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedure to request emergency or natural disaster funds.</E> To obtain emergency or natural disaster funds, a PHA shall submit a written request in the form and manner prescribed by HUD. In a natural disaster where the PHA requires immediate relief to preserve the property and safety of the residents, the PHA may submit a preliminary request outlined in paragraph (d) of this section. Subsequently, the PHA is required to complete and submit the remaining information outlined in paragraph (e) of this section, at a time prescribed by HUD. For emergency requests, PHAs are to follow the procedures outlined in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure to request preliminary natural disaster grant for immediate preservation.</E> A PHA may request a preliminary grant only for costs necessary for immediate preservation of the property and safety of the residents. The application should include the reasonable identification of damage and preservation costs as determined by the PHA. An independent assessment will be required when the PHA submits the final request or when the PHA reconciles the preliminary application grant with the actual amounts received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), insurance carriers, and other natural disaster relief sources. Regardless of whether further funding from the set-aside is requested, at a time specified by HUD, the PHA will be expected to provide a reconciliation of all funds received, to ensure that the PHA does not receive duplicate funding.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure for an emergency or a final request for natural disaster funds.</E> In the request the PHA shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Identify the public housing project(s) with the emergency or natural disaster condition(s).</P>
              <P>(2) Identify and provide the date of the conditions that present an unforeseen or unpreventable threat to the health, life, or safety of residents, in the case of emergency; or Natural disaster (e.g., hurricane, tornado, etc.).</P>
              <P>(3) Describe the activities that will be undertaken to correct the emergency or the conditions caused by the natural disaster and the estimated cost.</P>

              <P>(4) Provide an independent assessment of the extent of and the cost to correct the condition. The assessment must be specific as to the damage and costs associated with the emergency or <PRTPAGE P="335"/>natural disaster. An independent estimate of damage and repair cost is required as a part of the final natural disaster application. For natural disasters, the assessment must identify damage specifically caused by the natural disaster. The set-aside can be used only to pay costs to repair or replace a public housing project damaged as a result of the natural disaster, not for nonroutine maintenance or other improvements.</P>
              <P>(5) Provide a copy of a currently effective DOT covering the property and an opinion of counsel that there are no preexisting liens or other encumbrances on the property.</P>
              <P>(6) Demonstrate that without the requested funds from the set-aside, the PHA does not have adequate funds available to correct the emergency condition(s).</P>
              <P>(7) Identify all other sources of available funds (e.g., insurance proceeds, FEMA).</P>
              <P>(8) Any other material required by HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">HUD Action.</E> HUD shall review all requests for emergency or natural disaster funds. If HUD determines that a PHA's request meets the requirements of this section, HUD shall approve the request subject to the availability of funds in the set-aside, in the order in which requests are received and are determined approvable.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Submission of the CF ACC.</E> Upon being provided with a CF ACC Amendment from HUD, the PHA must sign and date the CF ACC Amendment and return it to HUD by the date established by HUD. HUD will execute the signed and dated CF ACC Amendment submitted by the PHA.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in this section apply to both qualified PHAs (as described in § 903.3(c) of this chapter) and nonqualified PHAs. Each PHA must complete a comprehensive physical needs assessment (PNA).</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> Small PHAs (PHAs that own or operate fewer than 250 public housing units) must comply with the requirements of this section beginning 30 days after the end of the federal fiscal year quarter following HUD's publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Capital Fund program submission requirements.</E> At the time that the PHA submits the ACC Amendment(s) for its Capital Fund Grants(s) to HUD, the PHA must also submit the following items:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">CFP 5-Year Action Plan.</E> (i) <E T="03">Content.</E> The CFP 5-Year Action Plan must describe the capital improvements necessary to ensure long-term physical and social viability of the PHA's public housing developments, including the capital improvements to be undertaken within the 5-year period, their estimated costs, status of environmental review, and any other information required for participation in the CFP, as prescribed by HUD. In order to be entitled to fungibility, PHA's must have an approved 5-year Action Plan. Except in the case of emergency/disaster work, the PHA shall not spend Capital Funds on any work that is not included in an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan and its amendments.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Budget.</E> The Capital Fund Budget for each of the 5 years shall be prepared by a PHA using the form(s) prescribed by HUD. Work items listed in the budget must include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(A) Where a PHA has an approved Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP) loan, debt service payments for the grants from which the payments are scheduled;</P>
              <P>(B) Where a PHA has an approved CFFP loan, the PHA shall also include all work and costs, including debt service payments, in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan. Work associated with the use of financing proceeds will be reported separately in a form and manner prescribed by HUD; or</P>

              <P>(C) Work affecting health and safety and compliance with regulatory requirements such as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's <PRTPAGE P="336"/>implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8, and the lead-based paint poisoning prevention standards at 24 CFR part 35, before major systems (e.g., heating, roof, etc.) and other costs of lower priority.</P>
              <P>(iii) PHA Criteria for Significant Amendment or Modification. The PHA must include in the basic criteria that the PHA will use for determining a significant amendment or modification to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In addition to the criteria established by the PHA, for the purpose of the CFP, a proposed demolition, disposition, homeownership, Capital Fund financing, development, or mixed-finance proposal are considered significant amendments to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Submission.</E> The PHA must submit a Board-approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan at least once every 5 years. The PHA may choose to update its CFP 5-Year Action Plan every year. The PHA shall indicate whether its CFP 5-Year Action Plan is fixed or rolling. Prior to submission to HUD, the 5-Year Action Plan must have been approved by the PHA's Board of Commissioners. In any given year that a PHA does not have a CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, the Capital Fund grant(s) for these PHAs will be reserved and obligated; however, the PHA will not have access to those funds until its CFP 5-Year Action Plan is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD.</P>
              <P>(v) Significant amendments or modification to the CFP 5 Year Action Plan. PHAs making significant amendments or modifications to the CFP 5-Year Action Plan, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, must follow the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) A PHA after submitting its 5-Year Action Plan may amend or modify the plan. If the amendment or modification is a significant amendment or modification, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the PHA:</P>
              <P>(1) May not adopt the amendment or modification until the PHA has duly called a meeting of its Board of Commissioners (or similar governing body) and the meeting at which the amendment or modification is adopted, is open to the public; and</P>
              <P>(2) May not implement the amendment or modification until notification of the amendment or modifications are provided to HUD and approved by HUD in accordance with HUD's plan review procedures, as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</P>
              <P>(B) Each significant amendment or modification to a plan submitted to HUD is subject to the requirement of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Certifications required for receipt of Capital Fund grants.</E> The PHA is also required to submit various certifications to HUD, in a form prescribed by HUD, including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) Certification of PIC Data;</P>
              <P>(ii) Standard Form—Disclosure of Lobbying Activities;</P>
              <P>(iii) Civil Rights Compliance, in a form prescribed by HUD; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Certification of Compliance with Public Hearing Requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Conduct of public hearing and Resident Advisory Board Consultation.</E> A PHA must annually conduct a public hearing and consult with the Resident Advisory Board (RAB) of the PHA to discuss the Capital Fund submission. The PHA may elect to conduct a separate annual public hearing in order to solicit public comments or to hold the annual public hearing at the same time as the hearing for the Annual PHA Plan, the 5-Year Plan, or the required annual hearing for qualified public housing authorities. The hearing must be conducted at a location that is convenient to the residents served by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(i) Not later than 45 days before the public hearing is to take place, the PHA must:</P>
              <P>(A) Make the Capital Fund submission along with the material required under this paragraph (b) available to the residents and the RAB; and</P>
              <P>(B) Publish a notice informing the public that the information is available for review and inspection; that a public hearing will take place on the plan; and of the date, time, and location of the hearing.</P>

              <P>(C) PHAs shall conduct reasonable outreach activities to encourage broad public participation in the review of the Capital Fund submission.<PRTPAGE P="337"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Public and RAB comments.</E> The PHA must consider the comments from the residents, the public, and the RAB on the Capital Fund submission, or any significant modification thereto. In submitting the final CFP 5-Year Action Plan to HUD for approval, or any significant amendment or modification to the 5-Year Action Plan to HUD for approval, the PHA must include a copy of the recommendations made by the RAB(s) and a description of the manner in which the PHA addressed these recommendations.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Consistency with Consolidated Plan.</E> The Capital Fund submission must be consistent with any applicable Consolidated Plan.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">HUD review and approval.</E> The CFP submission requirements must meet the requirements of this part as well as the Public Housing Program Requirements as defined in § 905.108 of this part. A PHA is required to revise or correct information that is not in compliance, and HUD has the authority to impose administrative sanctions until the appropriate revisions are made. HUD will review the CFP submission requirements to determine whether:</P>
              <P>(i) All of the information that is required to be submitted is included;</P>
              <P>(ii) The information is consistent with the needs identified in the PNA and data available to HUD; and</P>
              <P>(iii) There are any issues of compliance with applicable laws, regulations, or contract requirements that have not been addressed with the proposed use of the Capital Fund.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Time frame for submission of CFP requirements.</E> The requirements identified in this paragraph (b) must be submitted to HUD, in a format prescribed by HUD, at the time that the PHA submits its signed CF ACC Amendment.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Performance and Evaluation Report.</E> (i) All PHAs must prepare a CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report at a time and in a format prescribed by HUD. These reports shall be retained on file for all grants for which a final Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or an Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) has not been submitted. A final Performance and Evaluation Report must be submitted in accordance with 24 CFR 905.322, at the time the PHA submits its AMCC or ADCC.</P>
              <P>(ii) PHAs that are designated as troubled performers under PHAS (24 CFR part 902) or as troubled under the Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) (24 CFR part 985), and/or were identified as noncompliant with section 9(j) obligation and expenditure requirements during the fiscal year, shall submit their CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Reports to HUD for review and approval.</P>
              <P>(iii) All other PHAs, that are not designated as troubled performers under PHAS and are not designated as troubled under SEMAP, and that were in compliance with section 9(j) obligation and expenditure requirements during the fiscal year, shall prepare a CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation report for all open grants and shall retain the report(s) on file at the PHA, to be available to HUD upon request.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Moving to Work (MTW) PHAs.</E> MTW PHAs are to submit the Capital Fund submissions as part of the MTW Plan annually, as required by the MTW Agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Period of obligation to operate as public housing.</E> The PHA shall operate <PRTPAGE P="338"/>all public housing projects in accordance with the CF ACC, as amended, and applicable HUD regulations, for the statutorily prescribed period. These periods shall be evidenced by a recorded DOT on all public housing property. If the PHA uses Capital Funds to develop public housing or to modernize existing public housing, the CF ACC term and the covenant to operate those projects are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Development activities.</E> Each public housing project developed using Capital Funds shall establish a restricted use covenant, either in the DOT or as a Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, to operate under the terms and conditions applicable to public housing for a 40-year period that begins on the date on which the project becomes available for occupancy, as determined by HUD.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Modernization activities.</E> For PHAs that receive Capital Fund assistance, the execution of each new CF ACC Amendment establishes an additional 20-year period that begins on the latest date on which modernization is completed, except that the additional 20-year period does not apply to a project that receives Capital Fund assistance only for management improvements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operating Fund.</E> Any public housing project developed that receives Operating Fund assistance shall have a covenant to operate under requirements applicable to public housing for a 10-year period beginning upon the conclusion of the fiscal year for which such amounts were provided, except for such shorter period as permitted by HUD by an exception.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Mortgage or security interests.</E> The PHA shall not allow <E T="03">any mortgage</E> or security interest in public housing assets, including under section 30 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-2), without prior written approval from HUD. PHAs that undertake financing unsecured by public housing assets shall include the following nonrecourse language in all financing documents as follows:

              <EXTRACT>
                <P>“This financing is non-recourse to any public housing property (real or personal property including all public housing assets or income), or disposition proceeds approved pursuant to Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (unless explicitly permitted by HUD in the Section 18 approval letter).”</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Applicability of latest expiration date.</E> All public housing subject to this part or required by law shall be maintained and operated as public housing, as prescribed, until the latest expiration date provided in section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3)) or any other provision of law or regulation mandating the operation of the housing as public housing, or under terms and conditions applicable to public housing, for a specified period of time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Obligation and expenditure of Capital Fund grants.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Obligation.</E> A PHA shall obligate each Capital Fund grant, including formula grants, Replacement Housing Factor (RHF) grants, Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding (DDTF) grants, and natural disaster grants, no later than 24 months after, and emergency grants no later than 12 months after, the date on which the funds become available to the PHA for obligation, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, a PHA with unobligated funds from a grant shall disregard this requirement for up to not more than 10 percent of the originally allocated funds from that grant. The funds become available to the PHA when HUD executes the CF ACC Amendment. With HUD approval, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the PHA can accumulate RHF grants for up to 5 years or until it has adequate funds to undertake replacement housing. The PHA shall obligate 90 percent of the RHF grant within 24 months from the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Items and costs.</E> For funds to be considered obligated, all items and costs must meet the definition of “obligation” in § 905.108 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Extension to obligation requirement.</E> The PHA may request an extension of the obligation deadline, and HUD may grant an extension for a period of up to 12 months, based on:</P>
              <P>(1) The size of the PHA;</P>
              <P>(2) The complexity of the CFP of the PHA;<PRTPAGE P="339"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Any limitation on the ability of the PHA to obligate the amounts allocated for the PHA from the Capital Fund in a timely manner as a result of state or local law; or</P>
              <P>(4) Any other factors that HUD determines to be relevant.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">HUD extension for other reasons.</E> HUD may extend the obligation deadline for a PHA for such a period as HUD determines to be necessary, if HUD determines that the failure of the PHA to obligate assistance in a timely manner is attributable to:</P>
              <P>(1) Litigation;</P>
              <P>(2) Delay in obtaining approvals from the Federal Government or a state or local government that is not the fault of the PHA;</P>
              <P>(3) Compliance with environmental assessment and abatement requirements;</P>
              <P>(4) Relocating residents;</P>
              <P>(5) An event beyond the control of the PHA; or</P>

              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Failure to obligate.</E> (1) For any month during the fiscal year, HUD shall withhold all new Capital Fund grants from any PHA that has unobligated funds in violation of paragraph (a) of this section. The penalty will be imposed once the violations of paragraph (a) are known. The PHA may cure the noncompliance by:</P>
              <P>(i) Requesting in writing that HUD recapture the unobligated balance of the grant; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Continuing to obligate funds for the grant in noncompliance until the noncompliance is cured.</P>
              <P>(2) After the PHA has cured the noncompliance, HUD will release the withheld Capital Fund grant(s) minus a penalty of one-twelfth of the grant for each month of noncompliance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Expenditure.</E> The PHA shall expend all grant funds within 48 months after the date on which funds become available, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. The deadline to expend funds may be extended only by the period of time of a HUD-approved extension of the obligation deadline. No other extensions of the expenditure deadline will be granted. All funds not expended will be recaptured.</P>

              <P>(a) Physical structures shall be designed, constructed, and equipped to be consistent with the neighborhoods they occupy; meet contemporary standards of modest design, comfort, and livability (see also § 905.202(c) of this part); promote security; promote energy conservation; and be attractive so as to harmonize with the community.</P>
              <P>(b) All development projects shall be designed and constructed in compliance with:</P>
              <P>(1) A national building code, such as those developed by the International Code Council or the National Fire Protection Association; and the IECC or ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (both incorporated by reference, see § 905.110 of this part), for multifamily high-rises (four stories or higher), or a successor energy code or standard that has been adopted by HUD pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 12709 or other relevant authority;</P>
              <P>(2) Applicable state and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations;</P>
              <P>(3) Other federal requirements, including fire protection and safety standards implemented under section 31 of the Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992, 15 U.S.C. 2227 and HUD minimum property standards (e.g., 24 CFR part 200, subpart S);</P>

              <P>(4) Accessibility Requirements as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35; and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and</P>
              <P>(5) Occupancy of high-rise elevator structures by families with children. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437d(a), a high-rise elevator structure shall not be provided for families with children regardless of density, unless the PHA demonstrates and HUD determines that there is no practical alternative.</P>
              <P>(c) All modernization projects shall be designed and constructed in compliance with:</P>
              <P>(1) The modernization standards as prescribed by HUD;</P>

              <P>(2) Accessibility requirements as required by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and implementing regulations at 28 CFR part 35; and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100; and</P>
              <P>(3) Cost-effective energy conservation measures, identified in the PHA's most recently updated energy audit.</P>
              <P>(d) Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, in purchasing appliances, PHAs shall purchase appliances that are Energy Star products or Federal Energy Management Program designed products, unless the PHA determines that the purchase of these appliances is not cost effective.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Broadband infrastructure.</E> Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded or Capital Funds allocated after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the PHA determines and, in accordance with § 905.326, documents the determination that:</P>
              <P>(1) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or</P>

              <SUBJECT>Cost and other limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Eligible administrative costs.</E> Where the physical or management improvement costs will benefit programs other than Public Housing, such as the Housing Choice Voucher program or local <PRTPAGE P="342"/>revitalization programs, eligible administrative costs are limited to the amount directly attributable to the public housing program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum project cost.</E> The maximum project cost represents the total amount of public housing capital assistance used in connection with the development of a public housing project, and includes:</P>
              <P>(1) Project costs that are subject to the TDC limit (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, HCC and Community Renewal Costs); and</P>

              <P>(2) Project costs that are not subject to the TDC limit (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, Additional Project Costs). The total project cost to be funded with public housing capital assistance, as set forth in the proposal and as approved by HUD, becomes the maximum project cost stated in the ACC Amendment. Upon completion of the project, the actual project cost is determined based upon the amount of public housing capital assistance expended for the project, and this becomes the maximum project cost for purposes of the ACC Amendment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">TDC limit.</E> (1) Public housing funds, including Capital Funds, may not be used to pay for HCC and Community Renewal Costs in excess of the TDC limit, as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, HOPE VI grantees will be eligible to request a TDC exception for public housing and HOPE VI funds awarded in FFY 1996 and prior years. PHAs may also request a TDC exception for integrated utility management, capital planning, and other capital and management activities that promote energy conservation and efficiency. HUD will examine the request for TDC exceptions to ensure that they would be cost-effective, so as to ensure that up-front expenditures subject to the exceptions would be justified by future cost savings.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of TDC limit.</E> HUD will determine the TDC limit for a public housing project as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Step 1: Unit construction cost guideline.</E> HUD will first determine the applicable “construction cost guideline” by averaging the current construction costs as listed in two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality for specific bedroom sizes and structure types. The two indices HUD will use for this purpose are the R.S. Means cost index for construction of “average” quality and the Marshall &amp; Swift cost index for construction of “good” quality. HUD has the discretion to change the cost indices to other such indices that reflect comparable housing construction quality through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Step 2: Bedroom size and structure types.</E> The construction cost guideline is then multiplied by the number of units for each bedroom size and structure type.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Step 3: Elevator and nonelevator type structures.</E> HUD will then multiply the resulting amounts from step 2 by 1.6 for elevator type structures and by 1.75 for nonelevator type structures.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Step 4: TDC limit.</E> The TDC limit for a project is calculated by adding the resulting amounts from step 3 for all the public housing units in the project.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Costs not subject to the TDC limit.</E> Additional project costs are not subject to the TDC limit.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Funds not subject to the TDC limit.</E> A PHA may use funding sources not subject to the TDC limit (e.g., Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, low-income housing tax credits, private donations, private financing, etc.) to cover project costs that exceed the TDC limit or the HCC limit described in this paragraph (c). Such funds, however, may not be used for items that would result in substantially increased operating, maintenance, or replacement costs, and must meet the requirements of section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989) (42 U.S.C. 3545). These funds must be included in the project development cost budget.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Housing Construction Costs (HCC).</E> (1) <E T="03">General.</E> A PHA may not use Capital Funds to pay for HCC in excess of the amount determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of HCC limit.</E> HUD will determine the HCC limit as listed in at least two nationally recognized residential construction cost indices for publicly bid construction of a good <PRTPAGE P="343"/>and sound quality for specific bedroom sizes and structure types. The two indices HUD will use for this purpose are the R.S. Means cost index for construction of “average” quality and the Marshal &amp; Swift cost index for construction of “good” quality. HUD has the discretion to change the cost indices to other such indices that reflect comparable housing construction quality through a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The resulting construction cost guideline is then multiplied by the number of public housing units in the project, based upon bedroom size and structure type. The HCC limit for a project is calculated by adding the resulting amounts for all public housing units in the project.</P>
              <P>(3) The HCC limit is not applicable to the acquisition of existing housing, whether or not such housing will be rehabilitated. The TDC limit is applicable to such acquisition.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Community Renewal Costs.</E> Capital Funds may be used to pay for Community Renewal Costs in an amount equivalent to the difference between the HCC paid for with public housing capital assistance and the TDC limit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rehabilitation of existing public housing projects.</E> The HCC limit is not applicable to the rehabilitation of existing public housing projects. The TDC limit for modernization of existing public housing is 90 percent of the TDC limit as determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation does not apply to the rehabilitation of any property acquired pursuant to § 905.600 of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Modernization cost limits.</E> If the modernization costs are more than 90 percent of the TDC, then the project shall not be modernized. Capital Funds shall not be expended to modernize an existing public housing development that fails to meet the HUD definition of reasonable cost found in § 905.108 of this part, except for:</P>
              <P>(1) Emergency work;</P>
              <P>(2) Essential maintenance necessary to keep a public housing project habitable until the demolition or disposition application is approved; or</P>
              <P>(3) The costs of maintaining the safety and security of a site that is undergoing demolition.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Administrative cost limits and Capital Fund Program Fee.</E> (1) Administrative cost limits (for non-asset-management PHAs). The PHA shall not budget or expend more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant on administrative costs, in accordance with the CFP 5-Year Action Plan.</P>
              <P>(2) Capital Fund Program Fee (for asset-management PHAs). For a PHA that is under asset management, the Capital Fund Program Fee and administrative cost limits are the same. For the Capital Fund Program Fee, a PHA may charge a management fee of up to 10 percent of the annual CFP formula grant(s) amount, excluding emergency and disaster grants and also excluding any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house architectural and engineering work, or other special administrative costs required by state or local law.</P>
              <P>(i) Modernization. The PHA shall not budget or expend more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant on administrative costs, in accordance with its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. The 10 percent limit excludes any costs related to lead-based paint or asbestos testing, in-house Architectural and Engineering work, or other special administrative costs required by state or local law.</P>
              <P>(ii) Development. For development work with Capital Fund and RHF grants, the administrative cost limit is 3 percent of the total project budget, or, with HUD's approval, up to 6 percent of the total project budget.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Management improvement cost limits.</E> In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, a PHA shall not use more than 18 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2015, a PHA shall not use more than 16 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2016, a PHA shall not use more than 14 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY 2017, a PHA shall not use more than 12 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. In FY <PRTPAGE P="344"/>2018 and thereafter, a PHA shall not use more than 10 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for eligible management improvement costs identified in its CFP 5-Year Action Plan. Management improvements are an eligible expense for PHAs participating in asset management.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Types of labor.</E> A PHA may use force account labor for development and modernization activities if included in a CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD. HUD approval to use force account labor is not required when the PHA is designated as a high performer under PHAS.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">RMC activities.</E> When the entire development, financing, or modernization activity, including the planning and architectural design, is administered by an RMC, the PHA shall not retain any portion of the Capital Funds for any administrative or other reason, unless the PHA and the RMC provide otherwise by contract.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Capital Funds for operating costs.</E> A PHA may use Capital Funds for operating costs only if it is included in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan that is approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, and limited as described in paragraphs (l)(1) and (2) of this section. Capital Funds identified in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan to be transferred to operations are obligated once the funds have been budgeted and drawn down by the PHA. Once such transfer of funds occurs, the PHA must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 990 with respect to those funds.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Large PHAs.</E> A PHA with 250 or more units may use no more than 20 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for activities that are eligible under the Operating Fund at 24 CFR part 990.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Small PHAs.</E> A PHA with less than 250 units, that is not designated as troubled under PHAS, may use up to 100 percent of its annual Capital Fund grant for activities that are eligible under the Operating Fund at 24 CFR part 990, except that the PHA must have determined that there are no debt service payments, significant Capital Fund needs, or emergency needs that must be met prior to transferring 100 percent of its funds to operating expenses.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Contract administration.</E> The PHA is responsible, in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, for all contractual and administrative issues arising out of their procurements. The PHA shall maintain full and complete records on the history of each procurement transaction.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection and acceptance.</E> The PHA, or, in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity shall carry out inspections of work in progress and goods delivered, as necessary, to ensure compliance with existing contracts. If, upon inspection, the PHA determines that the work and/or goods are complete, satisfactory and, as applicable, otherwise undamaged, except for any work that is appropriate for delayed completion, the PHA shall accept the work. The PHA shall determine any holdback for items of delayed completion and the amount due and payable for the work that has been accepted, including any conditions precedent to payment that are stated in the construction contract or contract of sale. The contractor shall be paid for items only after the PHA inspects and accepts that work.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Guarantees and warranties.</E> The PHA or, in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity, shall specify the guaranty period and amounts to be withheld, as applicable, and shall provide that all contractor, manufacturer, and supplier warranties required by the construction and modernization documents shall be assigned to the PHA. The PHA shall inspect each dwelling unit and the overall project approximately 3 months after the beginning of the project guaranty period, 3 months before its expiration, and at other times as may be necessary to exercise its rights before expiration of any warranties. The PHA shall require repair or replacement of all defective items prior to the expiration of the guaranty or warranty periods.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notification of completion.</E> The PHA, or in the case of mixed finance, the Owner Entity, shall require that all contractors and developers notify the PHA in writing when the contract work, including any approved off-site work, will be completed and ready for inspection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Fiscal closeout.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each Capital Fund grant and/or development project is subject to fiscal closeout. Fiscal closeout includes the submission of a cost certificate; an audit, if applicable; a final Performance and Evaluation Report; and HUD approval of the cost certificate.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Submission of cost certificate.</E> (1) When an approved development or modernization activity is completed or <PRTPAGE P="346"/>when HUD terminates the activity, the PHA must submit to HUD the:</P>
              <P>(i) Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) within 12 months. For purposes of the CF ACC, costs incurred between the completion of the development and the date of full availability (DOFA) becomes the actual development cost; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) for each grant, no later than 12 months after the expenditure deadline but no earlier than the obligation end date. A PHA with under 250 units with an approved CFP 5-Year Action Plan for use of 100 percent of the Capital Fund grant in operations may submit the cost certificate any time after the funds have been budgeted to operations and withdrawn, as described in § 905.314(l) of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) If the PHA does not submit the cost certificate and the final CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report within the period prescribed in this section, HUD may impose restrictions on open Capital Fund grants; e.g., establish review thresholds, set the grant to “auto review” (HUD automatically reviews it on a periodic basis), or suspend grants, until the cost certificate for the affected grant is submitted. These restrictions may be imposed by HUD after notification of the PHA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Audit.</E> The cost certificate is a financial statement subject to audit pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. After submission of the cost certificate to HUD, the PHA shall provide the cost certificate to its independent public auditor (IPA) as part of its annual audit. After audit, the PHA will notify HUD of the grants included in the audit, any exceptions noted by the PHA auditor, and the schedule to complete corrective actions recommended by the auditor.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Review and approval.</E> For PHAs exempt from the audit requirements, HUD will review and approve the cost certificate based on available information regarding the Capital Fund grant. For PHAs subject to an audit, HUD will review the information from the annual audit provided by the PHA and approve the certificate after all exceptions, if any, have been resolved.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Recapture.</E> All Capital Funds in excess of the actual cost incurred for the grant are subject to recapture. Any funds awarded to the PHA that are returned or any funds taken back from the PHA in a fiscal year after the grant was awarded are subject to recapture.</P>

              <P>(A) Each public housing and section 23 bond-financed CF unit, except that each existing unit under the Turnkey III program shall count as one-fourth of a unit. Units receiving operating subsidy only shall not be counted.</P>
              <P>(B) Each existing unit under the Mutual Help program.</P>
              <P>(ii) HUD shall add to the overall unit count any units that the PHA adds to its inventory when the units are under CF ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the date that HUD establishes for the FFY in which the CF formula is being run (hereafter called the “reporting date”). New CF units and those reaching DOFA after the reporting date shall be counted for CF formula purposes in the following FFY.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Replacement units.</E> Replacement units newly constructed on or after October 1, 1998, that replace units in a project funded in FFY 1999 by the Comprehensive Grant formula system or the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system shall be given a new CF ACC number as a separate project and shall be treated as a newly constructed development as outlined in § 905.600 of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Reconfiguration of units.</E> Reconfiguration of units may cause the need to be calculated by the new configuration based on the formula characteristics in the building and unit's PIC module (refer to the formula sections here). The unit counts will be determined by the CF units existing after the reconfiguration.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Reduction of units.</E> For a project losing units as a result of demolition and disposition, the number of units on which the CF formula is based shall be the number of units reported as eligible for Capital Funds as of the reporting date. Units are eligible for funding until they are removed due to demolition and disposition in accordance with a schedule approved by HUD.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Computation of formula shares under the CF formula.</E> (1) <E T="03">Total estimated existing modernization need.</E> The total estimated existing modernization need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated existing modernization need per unit, as determined <PRTPAGE P="350"/>by paragraph (d) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated project needs.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Total accrual need.</E> The total accrual need of a PHA under the CF formula is the result of multiplying for each project the PHA's total number of formula units by its estimated accrual need per unit, as determined by paragraph (e) of this section, and calculating the sum of these estimated accrual needs.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">PHA's formula share of existing modernization need.</E> A PHA's formula share of existing modernization need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated existing modernization need divided by the total existing modernization need of all PHAs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">PHA's formula share of accrual need.</E> A PHA's formula share of accrual need under the CF formula is the PHA's total estimated accrual need divided by the total existing accrual need of all PHAs.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">PHA's formula share of capital need.</E> A PHA's formula share of capital need under the CF formula is the average of the PHA's share of existing modernization need and its share of accrual need (by which method each share is weighted 50 percent).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">CF formula capping.</E> (1) For units that are eligible for funding under the CF formula (including replacement housing units discussed below), a PHA's CF formula share shall be its share of capital need, as determined under the CF formula, subject to the condition that no PHA's CF formula share for units funded under the CF formula can be less than 94 percent of its formula share had the FFY 1999 formula system been applied to these CF formula-eligible units. The FFY 1999 formula system is based upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Grant formula system for PHAs with 250 or more units in FFY 1999 and upon the FFY 1999 Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) formula system for PHAs with fewer than 250 units in FFY 1999.</P>
              <P>(2) For a Moving to Work (MTW) PHA whose MTW agreement provides that its CF formula share is to be calculated in accordance with the previously existing formula, the PHA's CF formula share, during the term of the MTW agreement, may be approximately the formula share that the PHA would have received had the FFY 1999 formula funding system been applied to the CF formula eligible units.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Replacement Housing Factor to reflect formula need for developments with demolition or disposition occurring on or after October 1, 1998, and prior to September 30, 2013.</E> (1) <E T="03">RHF generally.</E> PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units attributable to demolition or disposition of units during the period (reflected in data maintained by HUD) that lowers the formula unit count for the CFF calculation qualify for application of an RHF, subject to satisfaction of criteria stated in paragraph (i)(5) of this section</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When applied.</E> The RHF will be added, where applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) For the first 5 years after the reduction of units described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) For an additional 5 years if the planning, leveraging, obligation, and expenditure requirements are met. As a prior condition of a PHA's receipt of additional funds for replacement housing provided for the second 5-year period or any portion thereof, a PHA must obtain a firm commitment of substantial additional funds, other than public housing funds, for replacement housing, as determined by HUD.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">Replacement housing funding in FFYs 1998 and 1999.</E> Units that received replacement housing funding in FFY 1998 will be treated as if they had received 2 years of replacement housing funding by FFY 2000. Units that received replacement housing funding in FFY 1999 will be treated as if they had received one year of replacement housing funding as of FFY 2000.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">PHA Eligibility for the RHF.</E> A PHA is eligible for this factor only if the PHA satisfies the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA will use the funding in question only for replacement housing;</P>

              <P>(ii) The PHA will use the restored funding that results from the use of the <PRTPAGE P="351"/>replacement factor to provide replacement housing in accordance with the PHA's 5-Year Action Plan, as approved by HUD under part 903 of this chapter as well as the PHA's Board of Commissioners;</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA has not received funding for public housing units that will replace the lost units under Public Housing Development, Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing, HOPE VI, Choice Neighborhoods, Rental Assistance Payment (RAP), or programs that otherwise provide for replacement with public housing units;</P>
              <P>(iv) The PHA, if designated as a troubled PHA by HUD, and not already under the direction of HUD or an appointed receiver, in accordance with part 902 of this chapter, uses an Alternative Management Entity, as defined in part 902 of this chapter, for development of replacement housing and complies with any applicable provisions of its Memorandum of Agreement executed with HUD under that part; and</P>

              <P>(B) With specific HUD approval, 24 months from the date that the PHA accumulates adequate funds to undertake replacement housing.</P>
              <P>(ii) To the extent the PHA has not obligated any funds provided as a result of the RHF within the time frames required by this paragraph, or has not expended such funds within a reasonable time, HUD shall recapture the unobligated amount of the grant.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding (DDTF) to reflect formula need for developments with demolition or disposition on or after October 1, 2013.</E> (1) <E T="03">DDTF generally.</E> In FFY 2014 and thereafter, PHAs that have a reduction in the number of units occurring in FFY 2013 and attributable to demolition or disposition are automatically eligible to receive Demolition and Disposition Transitional Funding. The DDTF will be included in their annual Capital Fund grant for a 5-year period to offset the reduction in funding a PHA would receive from removing units from inventory. DDTF is subject to the criteria stated in paragraph (j)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When applied.</E> DDTF will be added to a PHA's annual CFP grant, where applicable, for 5 years after the reduction of units described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and description.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This subpart provides the requirements necessary for a PHA to participate in the Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP), under which the PHA may obtain HUD approval to borrow private capital and pledge a portion of its annual Capital Fund grant or public housing assets and other public housing property of the public housing agency as security.</P>

              <P>(b) Under the CFFP, PHAs are permitted to borrow private capital to finance public housing development or modernization activities. A PHA may use a portion of its Capital Fund for <PRTPAGE P="353"/>debt service payments and usual and customary financing costs associated with public housing development or modernization (including public housing in mixed-finance developments). A PHA that undertakes such financing activities may, subject to HUD's written approval, grant a security interest in its future annual Capital Fund grants, which shall be subject to the appropriation of those funds by Congress. The PHA's financing activities are not obligations or liabilities of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not assume any liability with respect to any such pledge of future appropriations, and the Federal Government neither guarantees nor provides any full faith and credit for these financing transactions.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 905.505</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Program requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Written approval.</E> A PHA shall obtain written HUD approval for all Capital Fund financing transactions that pledge, encumber, or otherwise provide a security interest in public housing assets or other property, including Capital Funds, and use Capital Funds for the payment of debt service or other financing costs. HUD approval shall be based on:</P>
              <P>(1) The ability of the PHA to complete the financing transaction along with the associated improvements;</P>
              <P>(2) The reasonableness of the provisions in the Capital Fund Financing Proposal considering the other pledges or commitments of public housing assets, the PHA's capital needs, and the pledge being proposed; and</P>
              <P>(3) Whether the PHA meets the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Antideficiency.</E> Any pledge of future year Capital Fund grants under this section is subject to the availability of appropriations by Congress for that year. All financing documents related to future year Capital Fund amounts must include a statement that the pledging of funds is subject to the availability of appropriations.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditions on use</E>—(1) <E T="03">Development.</E> Any public housing that is developed using amounts under this part (including proceeds from financing authorized under this part) shall be operated under the terms and conditions applicable to public housing during the 40-year period that begins on the date on which the project becomes available for occupancy, except as otherwise provided in the 1937 Act.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Modernization.</E> Any public housing or portion of public housing that is modernized using amounts under this part (including proceeds from financing authorized under this part) shall be maintained and operated during the 20-year period that begins on the latest date on which the modernization is completed, except as otherwise provided in the 1937 Act.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Applicability of latest expiration date.</E> Public housing subject to the use conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section, or to any other provision of law mandating the operation of housing as public housing for a specific length of time, shall be maintained and operated as required until the latest such expiration date.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Declaration of Trust.</E> All public housing rental projects must show evidence satisfactory to HUD of an effective Declaration of Trust being recorded in first position, meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and covering the term of the financing. If part of a mixed-finance project, this evidence will be with the mixed-finance evidentiary documents.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) designation.</E> Generally, a PHA shall be designated a standard performer or high performer under PHAS (24 CFR part 902), and must be a standard performer or higher on the management and financial condition indicators. HUD will consider requests from a PHA designated as troubled under PHAS when the PHA is able to show that it has developed appropriate management and financial capability and controls that demonstrate its ability to successfully undertake the Capital Fund Financing Proposal. The PHA must comply with all applicable fair housing and civil rights requirements in 24 CFR 5.105(a). If a PHA has received a letter of findings, charge, or lawsuit involving ongoing systemic noncompliance under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Fair Housing Act, or Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, and the letter of findings, <PRTPAGE P="354"/>charge, or lawsuit has not been resolved to HUD's satisfaction, then unless the Capital Fund Financing Proposal is part of a plan to address such findings, charge, or lawsuit, the PHA will not be eligible for financing pursuant to the CFFP. HUD will determine if actions to resolve the charge, lawsuit, or letter of findings taken are sufficient to resolve the matter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Management capacity.</E> A PHA shall have the capacity to undertake and administer private financing and construction or modernization of the size and type contemplated. In order to determine capacity, HUD may require the PHA to submit a management assessment conducted by an independent third party, in a form and manner prescribed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Existing financing.</E> A PHA shall identify the nature and extent of any existing encumbrances, pledges, or other financing commitments of public housing funds undertaken by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Need for financing.</E> (1) A PHA must complete a physical needs assessment at the project level, in the form and manner prescribed by HUD that covers the PHA's entire public housing portfolio for the term of the financing and that takes into consideration existing needs and the lifecycle repair and replacement of major building components. The activity to be financed must be identified as a need in the physical needs assessment.</P>
              <P>(2) Based on the assessment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the PHA must demonstrate that the financing will not negatively impact the ability of the PHA to meet the ongoing needs of its public housing portfolio over the term of the financing. In making this demonstration, PHAs must reduce any projected future Capital Fund grants to account for planned or anticipated activities that would have the effect of reducing or otherwise limiting the availability of future Capital Fund grants. PHA projections must be detailed on the portfolio schedule form prescribed by HUD, and shall project a stabilized number of units (Stabilized Base Unit Count) to be reached in no more than 5 years after all planned or anticipated activities have been completed that would reduce future Capital Fund grants. PHAs must also take into consideration projected use of Capital Funds for other eligible activities under part 905, and may take into consideration alternative sources of financing that are available to help meet its needs.</P>
              <P>(3) For PHAs that are proposing to borrow more than $2 million on a cumulative basis, to the extent that:</P>
              <P>(i) Capital and other eligible Capital Fund needs exceed projected Capital Fund program funding amounts, and the PHA is not leveraging non-public housing funds as part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal transaction, then</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must demonstrate that it has considered leveraging non-public housing funds, and state why the proposed financing is appropriate in light of alternative sources available.</P>
              <P>(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, PHAs that size their financing by utilizing only replacement housing factor (RHF) funds, or PHAs that propose to use their Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds as part of a mixed-finance modernization transaction, are not required to comply with § 905.505(g).</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">CFP Plan.</E> (1) The use of the CFFP proceeds shall be included in a form and manner as required by HUD for CFP planning and budgeting and in a same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The CFFP proceeds shall be included as a separate Capital Fund grant to the same extent that PHAs are required to plan and budget Capital Fund grants. The use of Capital Funds for the payment of debt service and related costs shall be planned and budgeted as would other eligible uses of Capital Funds.</P>

              <P>(2) As part of its Capital Fund Financing Proposal, the PHA shall submit a Capital Fund financing budget, in the form and manner required by HUD, detailing the proposed use of the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds. There shall be no requirement for PHAs to submit a Capital Fund financing budget as part of their Capital Fund financing proceeds where the sizing of the financing is based upon the use of RHF funds for debt service, or where the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds are being used as part of a mixed-finance transaction. Approval letters for mixed-finance and <PRTPAGE P="355"/>RHF-related Capital Fund financing transactions shall be conditioned upon the approval of the mixed-finance proposal, or, in the case of conventional development, upon the approval of the development proposal and the execution of an associated construction contract with which the Capital Fund financing proceeds would be used.</P>
              <P>(3) The work financed with Capital Funds and described in the Capital Fund financing budget will be based on the physical needs assessment. The Capital Fund financing budget shall list the work items (e.g., roof replacement, window replacement, accessibility modifications) by development. These work items will constitute performance measures upon which the PHA's performance will be evaluated. A general representation of the work (e.g., “rehabilitation of the development”) is not sufficient.</P>
              <P>(4) The CFP Plan (submission (as described in paragraph (h) of this section) shall include a copy of the physical needs assessment described in § 905.505(g).</P>
              <P>(5) Financing proceeds under this part may be used only for the modernization or development of public housing and related costs including the modernization or development of non-dwelling space. Financing proceeds may not be used for administration or central office cost center costs (except for mixed-finance projects), management improvements, or upon non-viable projects, such as those subject to required conversion. Financing proceeds may be used to reimburse predevelopment costs, but only to the extent they were incurred in conformance with applicable regulatory requirements.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Debt Coverage Percentage.</E> (1) Except as stated in § 905.505(i)(2), a PHA shall not pledge more than 33 percent of its annual future Capital Fund grants for debt service payments, assuming level Capital Fund appropriations over the term of the debt obligation and any reduction attributable to activities projected by the PHA to occur during the term of the financing such as demolition, disposition, or conversion of public housing units or other occurrences that could limit the availability of Capital Funds, including a voluntary compliance agreement. This percentage of Capital Funds dedicated for debt service, taking into account adjustments for activities that would reduce the receipt of Capital Funds, is called the “Debt Coverage Percentage.”</P>
              <P>(2) A PHA may pledge up to 100 percent of any projected replacement housing factor (RHF) grants for debt service payments, provided that the pledge extends to the formula fund portion of its Capital Fund grants also, but that not more than 50 percent of its overall projected Capital Fund grants (including formula funds and RHF funds) are pledged. RHF projections shall account for any projected reductions in RHF over the term of the financing. Unless otherwise approved by HUD, PHAs shall be limited to sizing their loans based upon increments of RHF currently being received by the PHA. CFFP transactions pledging RHF funds shall include accelerated amortization provisions, requiring all RHF funds received by the PHA to pay debt service as those RHF funds are received. A RHF grant shall be used only to develop or pay financing costs for the development of replacement public housing units in accordance with § 905.10.</P>
              <P>(3) Subject to the reasonableness test in § 905.505(a)(2), PHAs may exceed 33 percent when pledging existing Capital Fund grants and RHF grants for the payment of debt service. Existing grants are grants that have been received by the PHA at the time of HUD's approval of the Capital Fund Financing Proposal.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Terms and conditions of financing.</E> The terms and conditions of all financing shall be reasonable based on current market conditions. The financing documents shall include the following, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Term.</E> The term of the Capital Fund financing transaction shall not be more than 20 years. All Capital Fund financing transactions shall be fully amortizing. Bridge loans and other short-term loans are permitted; however, unless otherwise approved by HUD, the CFFP Financing transaction may not be structured in a manner that generates program income.<PRTPAGE P="356"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Acceleration.</E> Unless otherwise approved by HUD, the financing documents shall provide that HUD approval is required before a lender may accelerate a PHA's debt obligation, for default or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Public housing assets.</E> A PHA may not pledge any public housing assets unless specifically approved in writing by HUD. PHAs seeking approval of a pledge of public housing assets must submit documentation to HUD that details the nature and priority of the pledge.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Variable interest rate.</E> All variable-rate transactions shall include an interest-rate cap. The financing documents must specify that the PHA shall not be liable to pay debt service with public housing funds, and that there shall be no recourse to public housing assets, beyond the interest-rate cap. The limitation on the pledge of Capital Funds specified in § 905.505(i) shall be calculated based on the interest-rate cap.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Other pledges or commitments.</E> PHAs seeking approval of a pledge of public housing assets must describe the nature and extent of existing commitments or pledges of public housing assets, providing documentation of such other commitments or pledges to the extent required by HUD.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> Financing documents must include any other terms and conditions as required by HUD.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Fairness opinion.</E> The PHA shall provide an opinion, in a form and manner prescribed by HUD, from a qualified, independent, third-party financial advisor attesting that the terms and conditions of the proposed financing transaction are reasonable given current market conditions with respect to such matters as interest rate, fees, costs of issuance, call provisions, and reserve fund requirements.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Financial controls and construction management.</E> (1) The PHA shall have a financial control and construction management plan describing how the PHA will ensure that:</P>
              <P>(i) Adequate controls are in place regarding the use of the Capital Fund financing proceeds; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The improvements will be developed and completed in a timely manner consistent with the contract documents.</P>
              <P>(2) This plan shall contain protocols and financial control mechanisms that address the design of the improvements, construction inspections, construction draws, and requisition approval checks and balances. A PHA that is designated troubled under PHAS, or other PHAs as determined by HUD, may be required to institute risk mitigation measures to ensure that the funds are used properly and for the purposes intended.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Work items.</E> To the extent that any changes in work items financed by Capital Fund financing proceeds meet or exceed the following threshold requirements determined by HUD, PHAs must obtain written approval of amendments to their Capital Fund financing budget from HUD:</P>
              <P>(1) A change in the type of activity being financed (for example, if the approved Capital Fund financing budget contemplated the proceeds being used for modernization, but after the proposal is approved, the PHA decides instead to pursue development);</P>
              <P>(2) A change in the project being modernized or developed with the proceeds;</P>
              <P>(3) A reduction in 20 percent or more in the number of public housing units being modernized; or</P>
              <P>(4) An increase of 20 percent or more of the cost of non-dwelling space.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Applicability of other Federal requirements.</E> The proceeds of the Capital Fund financing are subject to all laws, regulations, and other requirements applicable to the use of Capital Fund grants made under 24 CFR part 905, unless otherwise approved by HUD in writing. PHAs undertaking CFFP transactions shall be subject to the following requirements, which shall be further enumerated in a Capital Fund Financing Amendment to the Annual Contributions Contract (CFF ACC Amendment):</P>

              <P>(1) Amounts payable to the PHA by HUD pursuant to the CFFP and pledged to the payment of debt service by the PHA shall be used exclusively for debt service in accordance with the debt service schedule approved by HUD and shall not be available for any other purpose;<PRTPAGE P="357"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The financing does not constitute a debt or liability of HUD or the United States, the full faith and credit of the United States are not pledged to the payment of debt service, and debt service is not guaranteed by HUD or the United States;</P>
              <P>(3) Nothing in this CFF ACC Amendment or 24 CFR part 905 is intended to diminish HUD's authority to administer, monitor, and regulate the public housing program, including HUD's authority to exercise any administrative sanction or remedy provided by law; provided, however, that except as required by law, HUD will not assert any claim or right under the ACC, including the exercise of administrative sanctions and remedies, if and to the extent that the effect of such claim or right would be to reduce the payment of Capital Fund moneys to the PHA below the level necessary to pay debt service or delay the time for payment of such moneys such that required amounts would not be available to pay debt service when due;</P>
              <P>(4) The financing is subject to mandatory prepayment prior to the obligation end date and expenditure end date of the Capital Fund financing proceeds to the extent necessary for the Capital Fund Financing Proposal proceeds to comply with section 9(j) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(j)). Bond and loan documents shall include appropriate provisions such that prepayment shall be made by the lender, trustee, or appropriate third-party servicer approved by HUD, without any action by HUD post-approval;</P>
              <P>(5) HUD agrees, subject to the availability of appropriations, to approve immediately upon receipt from the PHA (subject to any legal requirements or constraints applicable at the time), a CFP Plan document (as described in 24 CFR 905.505(h)) and/or an annual CFF ACC Amendment, to the extent and in an amount sufficient to make the applicable debt service payment;</P>
              <P>(6) Prior to cumulatively reducing its inventory of public housing units by more than 5 percent of the Stabilized Base Unit Count, if, after the removal of units from inventory, the Debt Coverage Percentage under § 905.505(i)(1) would constitute more than 33 percent of future Capital Funds, the PHA shall prepay the financing such that the reduction in inventory shall not cause the Debt Coverage Percentage to increase. If the reduction in inventory is required by law or public housing requirements, the prepayment is not required to be made prior to the reduction in inventory, but instead shall be made as soon as possible after the PHA becomes aware of the requirement of law or public housing requirements, but only to the extent that Capital Funds are not otherwise needed by the PHA to address the health and safety issues or other requirements of law in the PHA's public housing portfolio, all as determined by HUD. For PHAs that size their loans based upon the projected receipt of RHF funds, prior to undertaking an activity that will reduce its RHF units below the number of units projected in the Capital Fund Financing Proposal as required by § 905.505(i)(3), the PHA shall prepay its loan such that debt service does not exceed 100 percent of projected RHF after accounting for the reduction in RHF units, all as determined by HUD.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Performance measures.</E> Pursuant to 24 CFR 905.505(h) a PHA is required to identify in its CFP Plan documents specific items of work that will be accomplished using the proceeds of the proposed financing. The identified items, which shall be quantifiable, shall be the basis on which HUD evaluates a PHA's performance. HUD may also utilize the Capital Fund financing budget, and Capital Fund Financing Proposal approval documents as the basis to evaluate a PHA's performance. Failure to meet performance measures may result in:</P>
              <P>(1) Failure to receive HUD approval for future financing transactions;</P>
              <P>(2) Failure to be considered for future competitive grant programs; and</P>
              <P>(3) Other sanctions HUD deems appropriate and authorized by law or regulation.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Reporting requirements.</E> (1) The use of the CFFP proceeds shall be reported in the same manner as a Capital Fund grant. The PHA shall submit a performance and evaluation report on a quarterly basis. PHAs that utilize their Capital Fund financing proceeds as part of a mixed-finance transaction, and PHAs that size their financing <PRTPAGE P="358"/>based upon RHF in their Capital Fund financing transactions, are not required to submit quarterly reports.</P>
              <P>(2) Each CFFP transaction and/or development project is subject to fiscal closeout in the same manner of a Capital Fund grant. Fiscal closeout includes the submission of an Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC) or Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC), an audit, if applicable, a final quarterly report, and a final Performance and Evaluation report.</P>

              <SUBJECT>General.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This subpart F applies to the development of public housing units to be included under an ACC and which will receive funding from public housing funds. PHAs must comply, or cause the Owner Entity and its contractors to comply, as applicable, with all of the applicable requirements in this subpart. Pursuant to § 905.106 of this part, when a PHA, a PHA partner, and/or an Owner Entity submits a development proposal and, if applicable, a site acquisition proposal, and executes an ACC covering the public housing units being developed, it is deemed to have certified by those executed submissions its compliance with <PRTPAGE P="360"/>this subpart. Noncompliance with any provision of this subpart or other applicable statutes or regulations, or the ACC Amendment, and any amendment thereto may subject the PHA, the PHA's partner and/or the Owner Entity to sanctions contained in § 905.804 of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Description.</E> A PHA may develop public housing through the construction of new units or the acquisition, with or without rehabilitation, of existing units. A PHA may use any generally accepted method of development including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Conventional.</E> The PHA designs a project on a property it owns. The PHA then competitively selects an entity to build or rehabilitate the project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Turnkey.</E> The PHA advertises for and competitively selects a developer who will develop public housing units on a site owned or to be owned by the developer. Following HUD approval of the development proposal, the PHA and the developer execute a contract of sale and the developer builds the project. Once the project is complete, the developer sells it to the PHA.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Acquisition with or without rehabilitation.</E> The PHA acquires an existing property that requires substantial, moderate, or no repair. Any repair work is done by PHA staff or contracted out by the PHA. The PHA must certify that the property was not constructed with the intent of selling it to the PHA or, alternatively, the PHA must certify that HUD requirements were followed in the development of the property.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">PHA use of force account labor.</E> The PHA uses staff to carry out new construction or rehabilitation, as provided in § 905.314(j) of this part.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Mixed finance.</E> Development or modernization of public housing units where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a PHA, pursuant to Section 905.604.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Development process.</E> The general development process for public housing development, using any method and with any financing, is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The PHA will identify a site to be acquired or a public housing project to be developed or redeveloped. The PHA or its Partner and/or the Owner Entity will prepare a site acquisition proposal pursuant to § 905.608 of this part and/or a development proposal pursuant to § 905.606 of this part for submission to HUD or as otherwise directed by HUD. The PHA may request predevelopment funding necessary for preparation of the acquisition proposal and/or development proposal, as stated in § 905.612(a) of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must consult with affected residents prior to submission of an acquisition proposal, development proposal, or both to HUD to solicit resident input into development of the public housing project.</P>
              <P>(3) After HUD approval of the site acquisition proposal and/or development proposal, HUD and the PHA shall execute the applicable ACC Amendment for the public housing units and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants on all property acquired and/or to be developed. The PHA may then commence development of the units.</P>
              <P>(4) Upon completion of the public housing project, the PHA will establish the DOFA. After the DOFA, the PHA will submit a cost certificate to HUD attesting to the actual cost of the project that will be subject to audit.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Funding sources.</E> A PHA may engage in development activities using any one or a combination of the following sources of funding:</P>
              <P>(1) Capital Funds;</P>
              <P>(2) HOPE VI funds;</P>
              <P>(3) Choice Neighborhoods funds;</P>
              <P>(4) Proceeds from the sale of units under a homeownership program in accordance with 24 CFR part 906;</P>
              <P>(5) Proceeds resulting from the disposition of PHA-owned land or improvements;</P>
              <P>(6) Private financing used in accordance with § 905.604 of this part, Mixed-finance development;</P>
              <P>(7) Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP) proceeds under § 905.500 of this part;</P>
              <P>(8) Proceeds resulting from an Operating Fund Financing Program (OFFP) approved by HUD pursuant to 24 CFR part 990; and</P>
              <P>(9) Funds available from any other eligible sources.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Program requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Local cooperation.</E> Except as provided under § 905.604(i) of this part for mixed-finance projects, the PHA must enter into a Cooperation Agreement with the applicable local governing body that includes sufficient authority to cover the public housing being developed under this subpart, or provide an opinion of counsel that the existing, amended, or supplementary Cooperation Agreement between the jurisdiction and the PHA includes the project or development.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">New construction limitation.</E> These requirements apply to the development (including new construction and acquisition) of public housing. All proposed new development projects must meet both of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Limitation on the number of units.</E> A PHA may not use Capital Funds to pay for the development cost of public housing units if such development would result in a net increase in the number of public housing units that the PHA owned, assisted, or operated on October 1, 1999. Subject to approval by the Secretary, a PHA may develop public housing units in excess of the limitation if:</P>
              <P>(i) The units are available and affordable to eligible low-income families and the CF formula does not provide additional funding for the specific purpose of constructing, modernizing, and operating such excess units; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The units are part of a mixed-finance project or otherwise leverage significant additional investment, and the cost of the useful life of the projects is less than the estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 8(o) of the 1937 Act.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitations on cost.</E> A PHA may not construct public housing unless the cost of construction is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units, including the amount required to establish, as necessary, an upfront reserve for replacement accounts for major repairs. A PHA shall provide evidence of compliance with this subpart either by:</P>
              <P>(i) Demonstrating through a cost comparison that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA proposes to construct the housing is less than the cost of acquisition of existing housing, with or without rehabilitation, in the same neighborhood; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Documenting that there is insufficient existing housing in the neighborhood to acquire.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing PHA-owned nonpublic housing properties.</E> Nonpublic housing properties may be used in the development of public housing units provided all requirements of the 1937 Act and the development requirements of this part are met.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Site and neighborhood standards.</E> Each proposed site to be newly acquired for a public housing project or for construction or rehabilitation of public housing must be reviewed and approved by the field office as meeting the following standards, as applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed. Adequate utilities (e.g., water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets shall be available to service the site.</P>
              <P>(2) The site and neighborhood shall be suitable to facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Executive Order 11063, and HUD regulations issued under these statutes.</P>
              <P>(3) The site for new construction shall not be located in an area of minority concentration unless:</P>
              <P>(i) There are already sufficient, comparable opportunities outside areas of minority concentration for housing minority families in the income range that is to be served by the proposed project; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot feasibly be met otherwise in that housing market area. “Overriding housing needs” shall not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable if the only reason that these needs cannot otherwise feasibly be met is that, due to discrimination because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin, sites outside areas of minority concentration are unavailable.</P>

              <P>(4) The site for new construction shall not be located in a racially mixed <PRTPAGE P="362"/>area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to nonminority residents in the area.</P>
              <P>(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after demolition of public housing units a PHA may construct public housing units on the original public housing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of replacement public housing units is significantly fewer than the number of public housing units demolished. One of the following criteria must be satisfied:</P>
              <P>(i) The number of public housing units being constructed is not more than 50 percent of the number of public housing units in the original development; or</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of replacing an occupied development, the number of public housing units being constructed is the number needed to house current residents who want to remain at the site, so long as the number of public housing units being constructed is significantly fewer than the number being demolished; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The public housing units being constructed constitute no more than 25 units.</P>
              <P>(6) The site shall promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.</P>
              <P>(7) The site shall be free from adverse environmental conditions, natural or manmade, such as: Toxic or contaminated soils and substances; mudslide or other unstable soil conditions; flooding; septic tank backups or other sewage hazards; harmful air pollution or excessive smoke or dust; excessive noise or vibrations from vehicular traffic; insect, rodent, or vermin infestation; or fire hazards. The neighborhood shall not be seriously detrimental to family life. It shall not be filled with substandard dwellings nor shall other undesirable elements predominate, unless there is a concerted program in progress to remedy the undesirable conditions.</P>
              <P>(8) The site shall be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities; health services; and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of similar unassisted standard housing. The availability of public transportation must be considered.</P>
              <P>(9) The site shall be accessible to a range of jobs for low-income workers and for other needs. The availability of public transportation must be considered, and travel time and cost via public transportation and private automobile must not be excessive. This requirement may be given less consideration for elderly housing.</P>
              <P>(10) The project may not be built on a site that has occupants unless the relocation requirements at § 905.308(b)(9) of this part are met.</P>
              <P>(11) The site shall not be in an area that HUD has identified as having special flood hazards and in which the sale of flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, unless the development is covered by flood insurance required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 and meets all applicable HUD standards and local requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Relocation.</E> All acquisition or rehabilitation activities carried out with public housing funds must comply with the provisions of § 905.308(b)(9).</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Environmental requirements.</E> All activities under this part are subject to an environmental review by a responsible entity under HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR Part 58 and must comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and the related laws and authorities listed at 24 CFR 58.5. HUD may make a finding in accordance with 24 CFR 58.11 and may perform the environmental review itself under the provisions of 24 CFR Part 50. In those cases where HUD performs the environmental review under 24 CFR Part 50, it will do so before approving a proposed project, and will comply with the requirements of NEPA and the related requirements at 24 CFR 50.4.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Mixed-finance development.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Mixed-finance development refers to the development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without rehabilitation) or <PRTPAGE P="363"/>modernization of public housing, where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than a PHA. If the public housing units being developed are 100 percent owned by the PHA, the project is not a mixed-finance project and will be not be subject to mixed-finance development requirements. However, all other development requirements of part 905 are applicable, and, if the project includes both public housing funds and private funding for development, the project may be subject to other applicable program requirements; e.g., the Capital Fund Financing Program, Operating Fund Financing Program, Public Housing Mortgage Program, etc.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Ownership.</E> There are various potential scenarios for the ownership structure of a mixed-finance project, such as: public housing units may be owned entirely by a private entity; a PHA may co-own with a private entity; or a PHA affiliate or instrumentality may own or co-own the units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Partnerships.</E> PHAs may choose to enter into a partnership or other contractual arrangement with a third party entity for the mixed-finance development and/or ownership of public housing units.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Funding.</E> Funding for mixed-finance developments may include one or a combination of funding sources, pursuant to § 905.600(d) of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Modernization.</E> A mixed-finance project that involves modernization, rather than new construction, shall maintain the DOFA date that existed prior to modernization and shall be subject to the provisions of § 905.304(a)(2) of this part regarding the applicable period of obligation to operate the public housing units.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions applicable to this subpart.</E> (1) <E T="03">Mixed-finance.</E> The development (through new construction or acquisition, with or without rehabilitation) or modernization of public housing, using public housing, nonpublic housing, or a combination of public housing and nonpublic housing funds, where the public housing units are owned in whole or in part by an entity other than the PHA. A mixed-finance development may include 100 percent public housing (if there is an Owner Entity other than the PHA) or a mixture of public housing and nonpublic housing units.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Owner Entity.</E> As defined in § 905.108 of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">PHA instrumentality.</E> An instrumentality is an entity related to the PHA whose assets, operations, and management are legally and effectively controlled by the PHA, and through which PHA functions or policies are implemented, and which utilizes public housing funds or public housing assets for the purpose of carrying out public housing development functions of the PHA. An instrumentality assumes the role of the PHA, and is the PHA under the Public Housing Requirements, for purposes of implementing public housing development activities and programs, and must abide by the Public Housing Requirements. Instrumentalities must be authorized to act for and to assume such responsibilities. For purposes of development, ownership of public housing units by an instrumentality would be considered mixed-finance development.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">PHA affiliate.</E> An affiliate is an entity, other than an instrumentality, formed by a PHA and in which a PHA has a financial or ownership interest or participates in its governance. The PHA has some measure of control over the assets, operations, or management of the affiliate, but such control does not rise to the level of control to qualify the entity as an instrumentality. For the purposes of development, ownership of public housing units by an affiliate would be considered mixed-finance development.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Public housing funds.</E> As defined in § 905.108 of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Structure of projects.</E> Each mixed-finance project must be structured to:</P>
              <P>(1) Ensure the continued operation of the public housing units in accordance with all Public Housing Requirements;</P>
              <P>(2) Ensure that public housing funds committed to a mixed-finance project are used only to pay for costs associated with the public housing units, including such costs as demolition, site work, infrastructure, and common area improvements.</P>

              <P>(3) To ensure that the amount of public housing funds committed to a project is proportionate to the number of public housing units contained in <PRTPAGE P="364"/>the project. To meet this “pro rata test,” the proportion of public housing funds compared to total project funds committed to a project must not exceed the proportion of public housing units compared to total number of units contained in the project. For example, if there are a total of 120 units in the project and 50 are public housing units, the public housing units are 42 percent of the total number of units in the project. Therefore the amount of public housing funds committed to the project cannot exceed 42 percent of the total project budget, unless otherwise approved by the Secretary. However, if public housing funds are to be used to pay for more than the pro rata cost of common area improvements, HUD will evaluate the proposal to ensure that common area improvements will benefit the residents in the development in a mixed-income project; and</P>
              <P>(4) Ensure that the project is within the Total Development Cost (TDC) and Housing Construction Cost (HCC) limits pursuant to § 905.314(c) and (d) of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Process.</E> Except as provided in this section, development of a mixed-finance project under this subpart is subject to the same requirements as development of public housing by a PHA entirely with public housing funds, as stated in § 905.600 of this part. PHAs must submit an acquisition proposal under § 905.608 and/or a development proposal under § 905.606 or as otherwise specified by HUD.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conflicts.</E> In the event of a conflict between the requirements for a mixed-finance project and other requirements of this subpart, the mixed-finance Public Housing Requirements shall apply, unless HUD determines otherwise.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">HUD approval.</E> For purposes of this section only, any action or approval that is required by HUD pursuant to the requirements set forth in this section shall be construed to mean HUD Headquarters, unless the field office is authorized in writing by Headquarters to carry out a specific function in this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Comparability.</E> Public housing units built in a mixed-financed development must be comparable in size, location, external appearance, and distribution to nonpublic housing units within the development.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Mixed-finance procurement.</E> The requirements of 2 CFR part 200 and 24 CFR 905.316 are applicable to this subpart with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(1) PHAs may select a development partner using competitive proposals procedures for qualifications-based procurement, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation and compliance with TDC and other applicable cost limitations;</P>
              <P>(2) An Owner Entity (which, as a private entity, would normally not be subject to 2 CFR part 200) shall be required to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if HUD determines that the PHA or PHA instrumentality, or either of their members or employees, exercises significant decision making functions within the Owner Entity with respect to managing the development of the proposed units. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt such an Owner Entity from the need to comply with 2 CFR part 200 if it determines that the Owner Entity has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Identity of interest.</E> If the Owner Entity or partner (or any other entity with an identity of interest with the Owner Entity or partner) of a mixed-finance project wants to serve as the general contractor for the mixed-finance project, it may award itself the construction contract only if:</P>
              <P>(1) The identity of interest general contractor's bid is the lowest bid submitted in response to a request for bids; or</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA submits a written justification to HUD that includes an independent third-party cost estimate that demonstrates that the identity of interest general contractor's costs are less than or equal to the independent third-party cost estimate; and</P>
              <P>(3) HUD approves the identity of interest general contractor in conjunction with HUD's approval of the development proposal for the mixed-finance project.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Operating Subsidy-Only and Capital Fund-Only Assistance.</E> (1) <E T="03">General.</E> This section refers to the mixed-finance development of public housing units that will be developed without public housing funds but will receive operating <PRTPAGE P="365"/>subsidy, or will be developed with public housing funds but will not receive operating subsidy.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating Subsidy-Only Development.</E> Operating Subsidy-Only Development refers to mixed-finance projects where public housing units are developed without the use of public housing funds, but for which HUD agrees to provide operating subsidies under Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act. These types of project are subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) The newly developed public housing units will be included in the calculation of the Capital Fund formula in § 905.400 of this part.</P>
              <P>(ii) An ACC Amendment will be executed to include the new public housing units. The term of the ACC Amendment will be determined based on the assistance as provided in § 905.304, unless reduced by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iii) There shall be no disposition of the public housing units without the prior written approval of HUD, during, and for 10 years after the end of, the period in which the public housing units receive operating subsidy from the PHA, as required by 42 U.S.C. 1437g(3), as those requirements may be amended from time to time. However, if the PHA is no longer able to provide operating subsidies to the Owner Entity pursuant to Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act, the PHA may (on behalf of the Owner Entity) request that HUD terminate the Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, as applicable. Termination under this section does not require disposition approval from HUD pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437p. However, the PHA must provide public housing residents with a decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable unit to which they can relocate, which may include a public housing unit in another development or a Housing Choice Voucher, and pay for the tenant's reasonable moving costs. The URA is not applicable in this situation.</P>
              <P>(iv) Where the PHA elects in the future to use public housing funds for modernization of these units, the PHA must execute an ACC Amendment with a 20-year use restriction and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants, in accordance with § 905.304. There may be no disposition of the public housing units without the prior written approval of HUD during the 20-year period, and the public housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as those requirements may be amended from time to time.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Capital Fund-Only Development.</E> Capital Fund-Only projects refers to mixed-finance projects where a PHA and its partners may develop public housing units using public housing funds for development of new units, but for which HUD will not be providing operating subsidy under Section 9(e) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e). These types of projects are subject to the following provisions:</P>
              <P>(i) The newly developed public housing units will not be included in the calculation of the Operating Fund formula.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must sign an ACC Amendment, with a 40-year use restriction, for development of new units and record a Declaration of Trust or Declaration of Restrictive Covenants in accordance with § 905.304 of this part, unless the time period is reduced by the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(iii) There shall be no disposition of the public housing units, without the prior written approval of HUD, during a 40-year period, and the public housing units shall be maintained and operated in accordance with all applicable Public Housing Requirements (including the ACC), as required by section 9(d)(3) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)(3), as those requirements may be amended from time to time.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> PHAs must follow the development approval process identified in § 905.600.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Mixed-finance operations: Deviation from HUD requirements pursuant to section 35(h) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437z-7(h).</E> (1) <E T="03">Deviation.</E> If a PHA enters into a contract with an entity that owns or operates a mixed-finance project, and the terms of the contract obligate the entity to operate and maintain a specified number of units in the project as public housing units, the contract may <PRTPAGE P="366"/>include terms that allow the Owner Entity to deviate from otherwise applicable Public Housing Requirements regarding rents, income eligibility, and other areas of public housing management with respect to all or a portion of the public housing units, subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) There are a significant number of units in the mixed-finance project that are not public housing units;</P>
              <P>(ii) There is a reduction in appropriations under Section 9(e) of the 1937 Act (see 42 U.S.C. 1437g(e)) or a change in applicable law that results in the PHA being unable to fulfill its contractual obligation to the Owner Entity with respect to the public housing units;</P>
              <P>(iii) Prior to implementation of the contractual terms related to deviation from the Public Housing Requirements, HUD approves an Alternative Management Plan for the mixed-finance project; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The deviation shall be to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of those units while maintaining the low-income character of the units to the maximum extent practicable.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preparation of an Alternative Management Plan.</E> Should the PHA and the Owner Entity determine a need to deviate from the Public Housing Requirements, the PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must submit an Alternative Management Plan to HUD for review and approval prior to implementation of any changes. The Plan must include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A statement describing the Owner Entity's reasons for deviating from the Public Housing Requirements;</P>
              <P>(ii) An explanation of the Owner Entity's proposed remedies, including, but not limited to:</P>
              <P>(A) How the Owner Entity will select the residents (including the number and income levels of the families proposed to be admitted to the public housing units) and units to be affected by the proposed change;</P>
              <P>(B) The Owner Entity's timetable for implementing the Alternative Management Plan;</P>
              <P>(C) The impact on existing residents. Note that for any resident who is unable to remain in the unit as a result of implementation of the Alternative Management Plan, the resident must be relocated to a public housing unit or given a Housing Choice Voucher by the PHA or by another entity as provided for in the contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity;</P>
              <P>(iii) An amendment to the existing contractual agreement between the PHA and the Owner Entity that includes provisions which ensure that:</P>
              <P>(A) An update on the Alternative Management Plan is submitted annually to HUD to ensure that implementation of the provisions of the Alternative Management Plan continue to be appropriate;</P>
              <P>(B) The Owner Entity complies with the requirements of this subpart in its management and operation of the public housing units in accordance with the Alternative Management Plan;</P>
              <P>(C) The Owner Entity provides the PHA any income that is generated by the public housing units in excess of the Owner Entity's expenses on behalf of those units, as a result of implementation of provisions in the Alternative Management Plan;</P>
              <P>(D) The Owner Entity reinstates all Public Housing Requirements (including rent and income eligibility requirements) with respect to the original number of public housing units and number of bedrooms in the mixed-finance development, following the PHA's reinstatement of operating subsidies at the level originally agreed to in its contract with the Owner Entity; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Additional evidence. The PHA must provide documentation that:</P>

              <P>(A) The Owner Entity has provided copies of the Alternative Management Plan to residents of the project and provided the opportunity for review and comment prior to submission to HUD. The Owner Entity must have provided written notice to each of the public housing residents in the mixed-finance development of its intention to implement the Alternative Management Plan. Such notice must comply with all relevant federal, state, and local substantive and procedural requirements and, at a minimum, provide public housing residents 90 days advance notice of any proposal to increase rents or to relocate public housing residents to alternative housing;<PRTPAGE P="367"/>
              </P>
              <P>(B) The revenues being generated by the public housing units (in combination with the reduced allocation of Operating Subsidy resulting primarily from a reduction in appropriations or changes in applicable law such that the PHA is unable to comply with its contractual obligations to the Owner Entity) are inadequate to cover the reasonable and necessary operating expenses of the public housing units. Documentation should include a financial statement showing actual operating expenses and revenues over the past 5 years and the projected expenses and revenues over the next 10 years;</P>
              <P>(C) A demonstration that the PHA cannot meet its contractual obligation, and;</P>
              <P>(D) The Owner Entity has attempted to offset with regard to the project, the impact of reduced operating subsidies or changes in applicable law by all available means; including the use of other public and private development resources, the use of cash flow from any nonpublic housing units, and funds from other operating deficient reserves.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">HUD review.</E> HUD will review the Alternative Management Plan to ensure that the plan meets the requirements of this subpart and that any proposed deviation from the Public Housing Requirements will be implemented only to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of the public housing units. Upon completion of HUD's review, HUD will either approve or disapprove the Alternative Management Plan. Reasons for HUD disapproval may include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The justification for deviation from the Public Housing Requirements does not qualify in accordance with section 35(h) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-7(h)).</P>
              <P>(ii) The proposed deviation(s) from the Public Housing Requirements are not limited to preserving the viability of the public housing units.</P>
              <P>(iii) The information that HUD requires to be included in the Alternative Management Plan has not been included, is not accurate, or does not support the need for deviation from the Public Housing Requirements.</P>
              <P>(iv) HUD has evidence that the proposed Alternative Management Plan is not in compliance with other federal requirements, including civil rights laws.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">HUD reevaluation and reapproval.</E> The PHA, on behalf of the Owner Entity, must provide to HUD, for HUD approval, an annual update on the implementation of the Alternative Management Plan. The update must provide the status of the project and whether the circumstances originally triggering the need for the conditions contained in the Alternative Management Plan remain valid and appropriate. Any proposed changes in the Alternative Management Plan should also be identified. Once the annual update of the Alternative Management Plan is properly submitted, the existing Alternative Management Plan shall remain in effect until such time as HUD takes additional action to approve or disapprove the annual update.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Development proposal.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Development proposal.</E> Prior to developing public housing, either through new construction or through acquisition, with or without rehabilitation, a PHA must submit a development proposal to HUD in the form prescribed by HUD, which will allow HUD to assess the viability and financial feasibility of the proposed development. A development proposal must be submitted for all types of public housing development, including mixed-finance. Failure to submit and obtain HUD approval of a development proposal may result in the public housing funds used in conjunction with the project being deemed ineligible expenses. In determining the amount of information to be submitted by the PHA, HUD shall consider whether the documentation is required for HUD to carry out mandatory statutory, regulatory, or Executive order reviews; the quality of the PHA's past performance in implementing development projects under this subpart; the PHA's demonstrated administrative capability; and other program requirements. The development proposal shall include some or all of the following <PRTPAGE P="368"/>documentation, as deemed necessary by HUD.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Project description.</E> A description of the proposed project, including:</P>
              <P>(i) Proposed development method (e.g., mixed-finance, new construction, acquisition with or without rehabilitation, turnkey, etc.), including the extent to which the PHA will use force account labor and use procured contractors. For new construction projects, the PHA must meet the program requirements contained in § 905.602. For projects involving acquisition of existing properties less than 2 years old, the PHA must include an attestation from the PHA and the owner of the property that the property was not constructed with the intent that it would be sold to the PHA or, if it was constructed with the intent that it be sold to the PHA, that it was constructed in compliance with all applicable requirements (e.g., Davis Bacon wage rates, accessibility, etc.);</P>
              <P>(ii) Type of residents to occupy the units (e.g., family, elderly, persons with disabilities, or families that include persons with disabilities);</P>
              <P>(iii) Number and type of unit (detached, semidetached, row house, walkup, elevator), with bedroom count, broken out by public housing vs. nonpublic housing, if applicable;</P>
              <P>(iv) The type and size of nondwelling space, if applicable; and</P>
              <P>(v) Schematic drawings of the proposed buildings, unit plans, and additional information regarding plans and specifications, as needed by HUD to review the project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Site information.</E> An identification and description of the proposed site and neighborhood, a site plan, and a map of the neighborhood.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Participant description.</E> Identification of participating parties and a description of the activities to be undertaken by each of the participating parties and the PHA; and the legal and business relationships between the PHA and each of the participating parties, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Development project schedule.</E> A schedule for the development project that includes each major stage of development, through and including the submission of an Actual Development Cost Certificate to HUD.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Accessibility.</E> A PHA must provide sufficient information for HUD to determine that dwelling units and other public housing facilities meet accessibility requirements specified at § 905.312 of this part, including, but not limited to, the number, location, and bedroom size distribution of accessible dwelling units (see 24 CFR 8.32 and 24 CFR part 40).</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Project costs.</E> (i) <E T="03">Budgets.</E> To allow HUD to assess sources of funding and projected uses of funds, the PHA shall submit a project budget, in the form prescribed by HUD, reflecting the total permanent development budget for the project, including all sources and uses of funds, including hard and soft costs. The PHA shall also submit a budget for the construction period and a construction draw schedule showing the timing of construction financing contributions and disbursements. In addition, the PHA shall submit an independent construction cost estimate or actual construction contract that supports the permanent and construction budgets.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">TDC calculation.</E> The PHA must submit a calculation of the TDC and HCC, subject to § 905.314 of this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Financing.</E> A PHA must submit a detailed description of all financing necessary for the implementation of the project, specifying the sources and uses. In addition, HUD may require documents related to the financing (e.g., loan documents, partnership or operating agreement, regulatory and operating agreement, etc.) to be submitted in final draft form as part of the development proposal. Upon financial closing, HUD may also require final, executed copies of these documents to be submitted to HUD for final approval, per § 905.612(b)(2) of this part.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Commitment of funds.</E> Documents submitted pursuant to this section must irrevocably commit funds to the project. Irrevocability of funds means that binding legal documents—such as loan agreements, mortgages, deeds of trust, partnership agreements or operating agreements, or similar documents committing funds—have been executed by the applicable parties; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/<PRTPAGE P="369"/>or other conditions generally consistent with similar non-public housing transactions. For projects involving revolving loan funds, the irrevocability of funds means that funds in an amount identified to HUD as the maximum revolving loan have been committed pursuant to legally binding documents; though disbursement of such funds may be subject to meeting progress milestones, the absence of default, and/or other conditions generally consistent with similar affordable housing transactions. The PHA must confirm the availability of each party's financing, the amount and source of financing committed to the proposal by the parties, and the irrevocability of those funds.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Irrevocability of funds.</E> To ensure the irrevocable nature of the committed funds, the PHA shall review the legal documents committing such funds to ensure that the progress milestones and conditions precedent contained in such contracts are generally consistent with similar affordable housing transactions; that the PHA and/or its Owner Entity know of no impediments that would prevent the project from moving forward consistent with the project milestones and conditions precedent; and, after conducting sufficient due diligence, that such documents are properly executed by persons or entities legally authorized to bind the entity committing such funds.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Third-party documents.</E> The PHA is not required to ensure the availability of funds by enforcing documents to which it is not a party.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Opinion of counsel.</E> As part of the proposal, the PHA may certify as to the irrevocability of funds through the submission of an opinion of the PHA's counsel attesting that counsel has examined the availability of the participating parties' financing, and the amount and source of financing committed to the project by the participating parties, and has determined that such financing has been irrevocably committed, as defined in paragraph (a)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, and that such commitments are consistent with the project budget submitted under paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Operating pro-forma/Operating Fund methodology.</E> To allow HUD to assess the financial feasibility of projects, PHAs shall submit a 10-year operating pro-forma, including all assumptions, to assure that operating expenses do not exceed operating income. For mixed-finance development, the PHA must describe its methodology for providing and distributing operating subsidy to the Owner Entity for the public housing units.</P>
              <P>(8) <E T="03">Local Cooperation Agreement.</E> A PHA may elect to exempt all public housing units in a mixed-finance project from the payment in lieu of taxes provisions under section 6(d) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(d), and from the finding of need and cooperative agreement provisions under sections 5(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437c(e)(1)(ii) and (e)(2), and instead subject units to local real estate taxes, but only if the PHA provides documentation from an authorized official of the local jurisdiction that development of the units is consistent with the jurisdiction's comprehensive housing affordability strategy. If the PHA does not elect this exemption, the Cooperation Agreement as provided in § 905.602(a) is required and must be submitted.</P>
              <P>(9) <E T="03">Environmental requirements.</E> The PHA must provide an approved Request for Release of Funds and environmental certification, submitted in accordance with 24 CFR part 58, or approval in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. HUD will not approve a development proposal without the appropriate environmental approval.</P>
              <P>(10) <E T="03">Market analysis.</E> For a mixed-finance development that includes nonpublic housing units, the PHA must include an analysis of the projected market for the proposed project.</P>
              <P>(11) <E T="03">Program income and fees.</E> The PHA must provide information identifying fees to be paid to the PHA, the PHA's partner(s), the Owner Entity, and/or other participating parties identified by HUD and on the receipt and use of program income.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Additional HUD-requested information.</E> PHAs are required to provide any additional information that HUD may need to assess the development proposal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Technical processing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Review.</E> HUD shall review all development proposals and site acquisition proposals for compliance with the statutory, Executive order, and regulatory requirements applicable to the development of public housing and the project. HUD's review will evaluate whether the proposed sources and uses of funds are eligible and reasonable, and whether the financing and other documentation establish to HUD's satisfaction that the development is financially viable and structured so as to adequately protect the federal investment of funds in the development. For this purpose, HUD will consider the PHA's proposed methodology for allocating operating subsidies on behalf of the public housing units, the projected revenue to be generated by any nonpublic housing units in a mixed-finance development, and the 10-year operating pro forma and other information contained in the development proposal.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Subsidy layering analysis.</E> After the PHA submits the documentation required under paragraph (a) of this section, HUD or its designee (e.g., the State Housing Finance Agency) shall carry out a subsidy layering analysis, pursuant to section 102(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) (see 24 CFR part 4), to determine that the amount of assistance being provided for the development is not more than necessary to make the assisted activity feasible after taking into account the other governmental assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Safe harbor standards.</E> For mixed-finance projects, in order to expedite the mixed-finance review process and control costs, HUD may make available safe harbor and maximum fee ranges for a number of costs. If a project is at or below a safe harbor standard, no further review will be required by HUD. If a project is above a safe harbor standard, additional review by HUD will be necessary. In order to approve terms above the safe harbor, the PHA must demonstrate to HUD in writing that the negotiated terms are appropriate for the level of risk involved in the project, the scope of work, any specific circumstances of the development, and the local or national market for the services provided.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Approval.</E> If HUD determines that a site acquisition proposal or a development proposal is approvable, HUD shall notify the PHA in writing of its approval. The HUD approval of a development proposal will include the appropriate form of ACC for signature. <PRTPAGE P="371"/>The PHA must execute the ACC and return it to HUD for execution. Until HUD approves a development proposal, a PHA may only expend public housing funds for predevelopment costs, as provided in § 905.612 of this part.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Amendments to approved development proposals.</E> HUD must approve any material change to an approved development proposal. HUD defines material change as:</P>
              <P>(1) A change in the number of public housing units;</P>
              <P>(2) A change in the number of bedrooms by an increase/decrease of more than 10 percent;</P>
              <P>(3) A change in cost or financing by an increase/decrease of more than 10 percent; or</P>
              <P>(4) A change in the site.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Disbursement of Capital Funds—predevelopment costs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Predevelopment costs.</E> After a new development project has been included in the CFP 5-Year Action Plan that has been approved by the PHA Board of Commissioners and HUD, a PHA may use funding for predevelopment expenses. Predevelopment funds may be expended in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) Predevelopment assistance may be used to pay for materials and services related to proposal development and project soft costs. It may also be used to pay for costs related to the demolition of units on a proposed site. Absent HUD approval, predevelopment assistance may not be used to pay for site work, installation of infrastructure, construction, or other hard costs related to a development.</P>
              <P>(2) For non-mixed-finance projects, predevelopment funding up to 5 percent of the total amount of the public housing funds committed to a project does not require HUD approval. HUD shall determine on a case-by-case basis that an amount greater than 5 percent may be drawn down by a PHA to pay for necessary and reasonable predevelopment costs, based upon a consideration of the nature and scope of activities proposed to be carried out by the PHA. Before a request for predevelopment assistance in excess of 5 percent may be approved, the PHA must provide to HUD information and documentation specified in §§ 905.606 and 905.608 of this part, as HUD deems appropriate.</P>
              <P>(3) For mixed-finance projects, all funding for predevelopment costs must be reviewed and approved by HUD prior to expenditure.</P>
              <P>(4) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section to disburse funds for mixed-financed projects in an approved ratio to other public and private funding do not apply to disbursement of predevelopment funds.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Standard drawdown requirements.</E> (1) <E T="03">General.</E> If HUD determines that the proposed development is approvable, it may execute with the PHA the applicable ACC Amendment to provide funds for the purposes and in the amounts approved by HUD. Upon approval of the development proposal and all necessary documentation evidencing and implementing the development plan, the PHA may disburse amounts as are necessary and consistent with the approved development proposal without further HUD approval, unless HUD determines that such approval is necessary. Once HUD approves the site acquisition proposal, the PHA may request funds for acquisition activities. Each Capital Fund disbursement from HUD is deemed to be an attestation of compliance by the PHA with the requirements of this part, as prescribed in § 905.106 of this part. If HUD determines that the PHA is in noncompliance with any provision of this part, the PHA may be subject to the sanctions in § 905.800, subpart H, of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Mixed-finance projects.</E> For mixed-finance projects, prior to PHA disbursement of public housing funds, except predevelopment funds identified in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD may require a PHA to submit to HUD, for review and approval, copies of final, fully executed, and, where appropriate, recorded documents, submitted as part of the development proposal process. Upon completion of the project, the ratio of public housing funds to non-public housing funds for the overall project must remain as reflected in the executed documents. The ratio does not apply during the construction period.</P>

              <P>(a) This part states the requirements and procedures governing public housing homeownership programs involving sales of individual dwelling units to families or to purchase and resale entities (PREs) for resale to families carried out by public housing agencies (PHAs), as authorized by section 32 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-4) (1937 Act). A PHA may only transfer public housing units for homeownership under a homeownership program approved by HUD under this part, except as provided under § 906.3. This section does not govern new construction or substantial rehabilitation of units sold under this part. Such construction or rehabilitation is governed by the public housing development and modernization regulations.<PRTPAGE P="374"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Under a public housing homeownership program, a PHA makes available for purchase by low-income families for use as their principal residences public housing dwelling units, public housing developments, and other housing units or developments owned, assisted, or operated, or otherwise acquired by the PHA for sale under a homeownership program in connection with the use of assistance provided under the 1937 Act (1937 Act funds). A PHA may sell all or a portion of a property for purposes of homeownership in accordance with a HUD-approved homeownership program, and in accordance with the PHA's annual plan under part 903 of this title.</P>

The PHA must indicate whether it, or a PRE will sell units to families directly or via such lease-purchase method. If the PHA or PRE will use a lease-purchase method the proposal should indicate the terms of the lease-purchase arrangement. The terms of the lease-purchase arrangement shall include, but are not limited to the periodic documentation to be provided to the family regarding the amount they have accrued toward the down payment, and the length of the lease period (with regard to PREs the sales must be completed within the statutory 5-year period.);</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Property description.</E> (1) If the program involves only financing assistance to the family purchasing the unit, the PHA need not specify property addresses, but it must describe the area(s) in which the assistance is to be used;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Environmental requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> HUD environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 58 apply to this part, unless, under § 58.11 of this title, HUD itself performs the environmental review under 24 CFR part 50. The PHA conducting a homeownership program under this part must comply with this section and part 50 or 58, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Assistance to facilitate the purchase of homes.</E> Where the PHA's homeownership program involves assistance provided under the 1937 Act solely to assist homebuyers to purchase existing dwelling units or dwelling units under construction, an environmental review is not required under part 58 or part 50 of this title. However, the requirements of § 58.6 or § 50.19(b)(15) of this title are still applicable.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Public housing units in the PHA's inventory.</E> Before the PHA rehabilitates or repairs units in its inventory for use <PRTPAGE P="384"/>for homeownership, or expends or commits HUD or local funds for such activities, the responsible entity must comply with part 58 and the PHA, where required, must submit and receive HUD approval of its request for release of funds, or HUD must have completed any part 50 environmental review and notified the PHA of its approval of the property. HUD may not release funds under this part before the appropriate approval is obtained.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Units to be acquired with federal funds and used for public housing homeownership.</E> A PHA may not enter into any contract for acquisition of real property to be used in a homeownership program unless the required environmental reviews have been performed and approvals have been obtained.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Specific units unidentified.</E> Where the PHA's homeownership program contemplates acquisition of properties not identified at the time of submission, the PHA must certify that it will comply with this section, including paragraph (f) of this section, prior to such acquisition or construction. HUD may conditionally approve such a homeownership program; however, HUD will not give final approval of any site or unit until the required environmental review has been completed.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Information.</E> The PHA shall supply all relevant information necessary for the responsible entity, or HUD, if applicable, to perform the environmental review for each property included in the homeownership program, and, if necessary, shall carry out mitigating measures or select alternate eligible properties. Where HUD performs the environmental review, the PHA shall comply with 24 CFR 50.3(h).</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Non-exclusivity.</E> Nothing in this section relieves the participating PHA, and its partners and contractors, from complying with all requirements of 24 CFR part 50 or part 58, as applicable.</P>

              <P>HUD may approve a homeownership program as submitted, conditionally approve it under § 906.47(e), or return it to the PHA for revision and resubmission. Where such conditional approval is given, the PHA, partners, and contractors remain subject to the restrictions in § 906.47. Upon HUD notification to the PHA that the homeownership program is approvable (in final form that satisfies all applicable requirements of this part), the PHA and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement, in a form prescribed by HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The program itself, as approved by HUD, must be incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also be incorporated, if agreeable to the PHA and HUD. The PHA is obligated to carry out the approved homeownership program and other provisions of the implementing agreement without modification, except with written approval by HUD.</P>

            <P>The purpose of this part is to require Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), including Moving-to-Work (MTW) PHAs, that operate Public Housing, Indian Housing, or Section 8 Rental Certificate, Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Rental Voucher, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs to electronically submit certain data to HUD for those programs. These electronically submitted data are required for HUD forms: HUD-50058, including the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Addendum. Applicable program entities must retain at a minimum, the last three years of the form HUD-50058, and supporting documentation, during the term of each assisted lease, and for a period of at least 3 years from the end of participation (EOP) date, to support billings to HUD and to permit an effective audit. Electronic retention of form HUD-50058 and HUD-50058-FSS and supporting documentation fulfills the record retention requirement under this section.</P>

Regardless of whether an HA obtains the ADP system itself or contracts with a service bureau to provide the system, the software must be periodically updated to incorporate changes or revisions in legislation, regulations, handbooks, notices, or HUD electronic transmission data format requirements.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Service contract.</E> HAs that determine that the purchase of hardware and/or software is not cost effective may contract out the electronic data transmission function to organizations that provide such services, including, but not limited to the following organizations: local management associations and management agents with centralized facilities. HAs that contract out the electronic transmission function must retain the ability to monitor the day-to-day operations of the project at the HA site and be able to demonstrate the ability to the relevant HUD Field Office.</P>
            <P>(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Department may approve transmission of the data by tape or diskette if it determines that the cost of telephonic transmission would be excessive.</P>

This means that the PHA has an obligation to assure that all program funds, including funds paid to the lead agency for administration by the consortium, are used in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements, and that the PHA program is administered in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements. Any breach of program requirements with respect to a program covered by the consortium agreement is a breach of the ACC with each of the participating PHAs, so each PHA is responsible for the performance of the consortium.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability of independent audit and performance assessment system requirements to consortia.</E> Where the lead agency will manage substantially all program and activities of the consortium, HUD interprets financial accountability to rest with the consortium and thus HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements on a consortium-wide basis. Where the lead agency will not manage substantially all programs and activities of a consortium, the consortium shall indicate in its PHA Plan submission which PHAs have financial accountability for the programs. The determination of financial accountability shall be made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as determined in consultation with an independent public accountant. In such situations, HUD will apply independent audit and performance assessment requirements consistent with that determination. With respect to any consortium, however, HUD may determine (based on a request from the consortium or other circumstances) to apply independent audit and performance requirements on a different basis where this would promote sound management.</P>

              <P>(b) A PHA may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement (request for qualifications or “RFQ”), or may solicit a proposal from only one source (“sole source”) to select a joint venture partner to perform an administrative or management function of its public housing program or to provide or arrange to provide supportive or social services covered under this part, under the following circumstances:</P>

              <P>(1) The proposed joint venture partner has under its control and will make available to the partnership substantial, unique and tangible resources or other benefits that would not otherwise be available to the PHA on the open market (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> planning expertise, program experience, or financial or other resources). In this case, the PHA must maintain documentation to substantiate both the cost reasonableness of its selection of the proposed partner and the unique qualifications of the partner: or</P>
              <P>(2) A resident group or a PHA subsidiary is willing and able to act as the PHA's partner in performing administrative and management functions or to provide supportive or social services. This entity must comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 (if the entity is a nonprofit or a State or local government) with respect to its selection of the members of the team and the members must be paid on a cost-reimbursement basis only. The PHA must maintain documentation that indicates both the cost reasonableness of its selection of a resident group or PHA subsidiary and the ability of that group or subsidiary to act as the PHA's partner under this provision.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What procurement standards apply to a PHA's joint venture partner?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A joint venture partner is not a grantee or subgrantee and, accordingly, is not required to comply with 2 CFR part 200 in its procurement of goods and services under this part. The partner must comply with all applicable State and local procurement and conflict of interest requirements with respect to its selection of entities to assist in PHA program administration.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Exception.</E> If the joint venture partner is a subsidiary, affiliate, or identity of interest party of the PHA, it is subject to the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 of this title. HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, exempt such a joint venture partner from the need to comply with requirements under 2 CFR part 200 of this title if HUD determines that the joint venture has developed an acceptable alternative procurement plan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contracting with identity-of-interest parties.</E> A joint venture partner may contract with an identity-of-interest party for goods or services, or a party <PRTPAGE P="392"/>specified in the selected bidder's response to a RFP or RFQ (as applicable), without the need for further procurement if:</P>
              <P>(1) The PHA can demonstrate that its original competitive selection of the partner clearly anticipated the later provision of such goods or services;</P>
              <P>(2) Compensation of all identity-of-interest parties is structured to ensure there is no duplication of profit or expenses; and</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA can demonstrate that its selection is reasonable based upon prevailing market costs and standards, and that the quality and timeliness of the goods or services is comparable to that available in the open market. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an “identity-of-interest party” means a party that is wholly owned or controlled by, or that is otherwise affiliated with, the partner or the PHA. The PHA may use an independent organization experienced in cost valuation to determine the cost reasonableness of the proposed contracts.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this part is to provide for designated housing as authorized by section 7 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437e).

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Agency participation.</E> Participation in this program is limited to public housing agencies (PHAs) (as this term is defined in 24 CFR 913.102) that elect to designate public housing projects for occupancy by disabled families, elderly families, or disabled families and elderly families, as provided by this part.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible housing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Designation of public housing.</E> Projects eligible for designation under this part are public housing projects as described in the definition of “project” in § 945.105.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Additional housing resources.</E> To meet the housing and supportive service needs of elderly families, and disabled families, including non-elderly disabled families, who will not be housed in a designated project, PHAs shall utilize housing resources that they own, control, or have received preliminary notification that they will obtain (e.g., section 8 certificates and vouchers). They also may utilize housing resources for which they plan to apply during the period covered by the <PRTPAGE P="393"/>allocation plan, and that they have a reasonable expectation of obtaining. PHAs also may utilize, to the extent practicable, any housing facilities that they own or control in which supportive services are already provided, facilitated or coordinated, such as mixed housing, shared housing, family housing, group homes, and congregate housing.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Exemption of mixed population projects.</E> A PHA with a public housing project with a mixed population of elderly families and disabled families that plans to house them in such project in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 960, subpart D, is not required to meet the designation requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Family Participation in designated housing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Voluntary participation.</E> The election to reside in designated housing is voluntary on the part of a family. No disabled family or elderly family may be required to reside in designated housing, nor shall a decision not to reside in designated housing adversely affect the family with respect to occupancy of another appropriate project.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Meeting stated eligibility requirements.</E> Nothing in this part shall be construed to require or permit a PHA to accept for admission to a designated project a disabled family or elderly family who does not meet the stated eligibility requirements for occupancy in the project (for example, income), as set forth in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR parts 912 and 913, and in the PHA's admission policies.</P>

Among these resources may be:</P>
              <P>(A) Normal turnover in existing projects;</P>
              <P>(B) Existing housing stock that previously was not available to or considered for non-elderly disabled families. Examples are dwellings in general occupancy (family) projects that are reconfigured to meet the dwelling size needs of the non-elderly disabled families, or were previously occupied by elderly families who will relocate to the designated project for elderly families, or were previously vacant because there had not been a demand for dwellings of that size in that location;</P>
              <P>(C) Housing for which the PHA has received preliminary notification that it will obtain; and</P>
              <P>(D) Housing for which the PHA plans to apply during the period covered by the allocation plan, and which it has a reasonable expectation of obtaining.</P>
              <P>(v) Where a project is being designated for elderly families, explain how the PHA plans to secure the required additional housing resources. In the case of housing for which the PHA plans to apply, the PHA must provide sufficient information about the housing resource and its application to establish that the PHA can reasonably expect to obtain the housing.</P>
              <P>(vi) Describe incentives, if any, that the PHA intends to offer to:</P>

              <P>(A) Families who are members of the group for whom a project was designated to achieve voluntary transfers <E T="03">to</E> the designated project; and</P>

              <P>(B) Families who are not members of the group for whom a project was designated to achieve voluntary transfers <E T="03">from</E> the project proposed to be designated;</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Criteria for allocation plan approval.</E> HUD shall approve an initial allocation plan, or updated allocation plan, if HUD determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The information contained in the plan is complete and accurate (a plan that is incomplete, i.e., missing required statements or items, will be disapproved), and the projections are reasonable;</P>
              <P>(2) Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial increase in the vacancy rates in the designated project;</P>
              <P>(3) Implementation of the plan will not result in a substantial increase in delaying or denying housing assistance to families on the PHA's waiting list because of designating projects;</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Priority for occupancy.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, in determining priority for admission to designated housing, the PHA shall make units in the designated housing available only to designated families.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance with preference regulations.</E> Among the designated families, the PHA shall give preference in accordance with the preferences in 24 CFR part 960, subpart B.<PRTPAGE P="401"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligibility of other families for housing designated for elderly families</E>—(1) <E T="03">Insufficient elderly families.</E> If there are an insufficient number of elderly families for the units in a project designated for elderly families, the PHA may make dwelling units available to near-elderly families, who qualify for preferences under 24 CFR part 960, subpart B. The election to make dwelling units available to near-elderly families if there are an insufficient number of elderly families should be explained in the PHA's allocation plan.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Insufficient elderly families and near-elderly families.</E> If there are an insufficient number of elderly families and near-elderly families for the units in a project designated for elderly families, the PHA shall make available to all other families any dwelling unit that is:</P>
              <P>(i) Ready for re-rental and for a new lease to take effect; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Vacant for more than 60 consecutive days.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Tenant choice of housing.</E> (1) Subject to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the decision of any disabled family or elderly family not to occupy or accept occupancy in designated housing shall not have an adverse affect on:</P>

              <P>(ii) The family's position on or placement on a public housing waiting list.</P>
              <P>(2) The protection provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply to any family who refuses to occupy or accept occupancy in designated housing because of the race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin of the occupants of the designated housing or the surrounding area.</P>
              <P>(3) The protection provided by paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to an elderly family or disabled family that declines to accept occupancy, respectively, in a designated project for elderly families or for disabled families, and requests occupancy in a general occupancy project or in a mixed population project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appropriateness of dwelling unit to family size.</E> This part may not be construed to require a PHA to offer a dwelling in a designated project to any family who is not of appropriate family size for the dwelling unit.

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Prohibition of evictions.</E> Any tenant who is lawfully residing in a dwelling unit in a public housing project may not be evicted or otherwise required to vacate the unit because of the designation of the project, or because of any action taken by HUD or the PHA in accordance with this part.</P>

              <P>(2) Be publicized by posting copies thereof in each office where applications are received and by furnishing copies to applicants or tenants upon request, free or at their expense, at the discretion of the PHA; and</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 960.203</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Standards for PHA tenant selection criteria.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The tenant selection criteria to be established and information to be considered shall be reasonably related to individual attributes and behavior of an applicant and shall not be related to those which may be imputed to a particular group or category of persons of which an applicant may be a member. The PHA may use local preferences, as provided in § 960.206.</P>

              <P>(b) Under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), PHAs that have adopted policies, implemented procedures and can document that they successfully screen out and deny admission to certain applicants with unfavorable criminal histories receive <PRTPAGE P="405"/>points. (See 24 CFR 902.43(a)(5).) This policy takes into account the importance of screening to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(c) In selection of families for admission to its public housing program, or to occupy a public housing development or unit, the PHA is responsible for screening family behavior and suitability for tenancy. The PHA may consider all relevant information, which may include, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(1) An applicant's past performance in meeting financial obligations, especially rent;</P>
              <P>(2) A record of disturbance of neighbors, destruction of property, or living or housekeeping habits at prior residences which may adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of other tenants; and</P>
              <P>(3) A history of criminal activity involving crimes of physical violence to persons or property and other criminal acts which would adversely affect the health, safety or welfare of other tenants. (See § 960.204.) With respect to criminal activity described in § 960.204:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA may require an applicant to exclude a household member in order to be admitted to the housing program where that household member has participated in or been culpable for actions described in § 960.204 that warrants denial.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may, where a statute requires that the PHA prohibit admission for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, choose to continue that prohibition for a longer period of time.</P>
              <P>(4) PHA tenant selection criteria are subject to 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking). In cases of requests for emergency transfers under VAWA, with the written consent of the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the receiving PHA may accept and use the prior covered housing provider's determination of eligibility and tenant screening and all related verification information, including form HUD 50058 (Family Report).</P>
              <P>(d) In the event of the receipt of unfavorable information with respect to an applicant, consideration shall be given to the time, nature, and extent of the applicant's conduct (including the seriousness of the offense).</P>
              <P>(1) In a manner consistent with the PHA's policies, procedures and practices referenced in paragraph (b) of this section, consideration may be given to factors which might indicate a reasonable probability of favorable future conduct. For example:</P>
              <P>(i) Evidence of rehabilitation; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence of the applicant family's participation in or willingness to participate in social service or other appropriate counseling service programs and the availability of such programs;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Consideration of rehabilitation.</E> (i) In determining whether to deny admission for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use, or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the PHA may require the applicant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</P>
              <P>(ii) If rehabilitation is not an element of the eligibility determination (see § 960.204(a)(1)), the PHA may choose not to consider whether the person has been rehabilitated.</P>

However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:</P>
              <P>(i) The evicted household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The circumstances leading to the eviction no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Persons engaging in illegal use of a drug.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission of a household to the PHA's public housing program if:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug (For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” the criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal use or pattern of illegal use of a drug may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Persons convicted of methamphetamine production.</E> The PHA must establish standards that permanently prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Persons subject to sex offender registration requirement.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In the screening of applicants, the PHA must perform necessary criminal history background checks in the State where the housing is located and in other States where household members are known to have resided. (See part 5, subpart J of this title for provisions concerning access to sex offender registration records.)</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Persons that abuse or show a pattern of abuse of alcohol.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the PHA's public housing program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Use of criminal records.</E> Before a PHA denies admission to the PHAs public housing program on the basis of a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant with a copy of the criminal record and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record. (See part 5, subpart J of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)</P>

              <SUBJECT>Waiting list: Local preferences in admission to public housing program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of PHA local preferences.</E> (1) The PHA may adopt a system of local preferences for selection of families admitted to the PHA's public housing program. The PHA system of selection preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities as determined by the PHA. In determining such needs and priorities, the PHA shall use generally accepted data sources. Such sources include public comment on the PHA plan (as received pursuant to § 903.17 of this chapter), and on the consolidated plan for the relevant jurisdiction (as received pursuant to part 91 of this title).</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA may limit the number of applicants that qualify for any local preference.</P>
              <P>(3) PHA adoption and implementation of local preferences is subject to HUD requirements concerning income-targeting (§ 960.202(b)), deconcentration and income-mixing (§ 903.7), and selection preferences for developments designated exclusively for elderly or disabled families or for mixed population developments (§ 960.407).</P>
              <P>(4) The PHA must inform all applicants about available preferences and must give applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for available preferences.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Particular local preferences</E>—(1) <E T="03">Residency requirements or preferences.</E> (i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although a PHA is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the PHA may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title.</P>
              <P>(ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”). A county or municipality may be used as a residency preference area. An area smaller than a county or municipality may not be used as a residency preference area.</P>
              <P>(iii) Any PHA residency preferences must be included in the statement of PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admission to the program, which is included in the PHA annual plan (or supporting documents) pursuant to part 903 of this chapter. Such policies must specify that use of a residency preference will not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to the program based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.</P>
              <P>(iv) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.</P>
              <P>(v) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The PHA may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for working families.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families <PRTPAGE P="409"/>where the head, spouse, or sole member, is employed). However, an applicant must be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Preference for person with disabilities.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the PHA may not adopt a preference for persons with a specific disability.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Preference for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</E> The PHA should consider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced, homeless or a person with disabilities.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Selection for particular unit.</E> In selecting a family to occupy a particular unit, the PHA may match characteristics of the family with the type of unit available, for example, number of bedrooms. In selection of families to occupy units with special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the PHA must first offer such units to families which include persons with disabilities who require such accessibility features (see §§ 8.27 and 100.202 of this title).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Housing assistance limitation for single persons.</E> A single person who is not an elderly or displaced person, or a person with disabilities, or the remaining member of a resident family may not be provided a housing unit with two or more bedrooms.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Selection method.</E> (1) The PHA must use the following to select among applicants on the waiting list with the same priority for admission:</P>
              <P>(i) Date and time of application; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A drawing or other random choice technique.</P>
              <P>(2) The method for selecting applicants must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that each applicant has been selected in accordance with the method specified in the PHA plan.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Rent options</E>—(1) <E T="03">Annual choice by family.</E> Once a year, the PHA must give each family the opportunity to choose between the two methods for determining the amount of tenant rent payable monthly by the family. The family may choose to pay as tenant rent either a flat rent as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, or an income-based rent as determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Except for financial hardship cases as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the family may not be offered this choice more than once a year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Relation to minimum rent.</E> Regardless of whether the family chooses to pay a flat rent or income-based rent, the family must pay at least the minimum rent as determined in accordance with § 5.630 of this title.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Flat rent</E>. The flat rent is determined annually, based on the market rental value of the unit as determined by this paragraph (b).<PRTPAGE P="410"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The PHA must establish a flat rent for each public housing unit that is no less than 80 percent of the applicable Fair Market Rent (FMR) as determined under 24 CFR part 888, subpart A; or</P>
              <P>(2) HUD may permit a flat rent of no less than 80 percent of an applicable small area FMR (SAFMR) or unadjusted rent, if applicable, as determined by HUD, or any successor determination, that more accurately reflects local market conditions and is based on an applicable market area that is geographically smaller than the applicable market area used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If HUD has not determined an applicable SAFMR or unadjusted rent, the PHA must rely on the applicable FMR under paragraph (b)(1) or may apply for an exception flat rent under paragraph (b)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA may request, and HUD may approve, on a case-by-case basis, a flat rent that is lower than the amounts in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, subject to the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA must submit a market analysis of the applicable market.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must demonstrate, based on the market analysis, that the proposed flat rent is a reasonable rent in comparison to rent for other comparable unassisted units, based on the location, quality, size, unit type, and age of the public housing unit and any amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the PHA in accordance with the lease.</P>
              <P>(iii) All requests for exception flat rents under this paragraph (b)(3) must be submitted to HUD.</P>
              <P>(4) For units where utilities are tenant-paid, the PHA must adjust the flat rent downward by the amount of a utility allowance for which the family might otherwise be eligible under 24 CFR part 965, subpart E.</P>
              <P>(5) The PHA must revise, if necessary, the flat rent amount for a unit no later than 90 days after HUD issues new FMRs.</P>
              <P>(6) If a new flat rent would cause a family's rent to increase by more than 35 percent, the family's rent increase must be phased in at 35 percent annually until such time that the family chooses to pay the income-based rent or the family is paying the flat rent established pursuant to this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Income-based rent.</E> (1) An income-based rent is a tenant rent that is based on the family's income and the PHA's policies for determination of such rents.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA rent policies may specify that the PHA will use percentage of family income or some other reasonable system to determine income-based rents. The PHA rent policies may provide for depositing a portion of tenant rent in an escrow or savings account, for imposing a ceiling on tenant rents, for adoption of permissive income deductions (see § 5.611(b) of this title), or for another reasonable system to determining the amount of income-based tenant rent.</P>
              <P>(3) The income-based tenant rent must not exceed the total tenant payment (§ 5.628 of this title) for the family minus any applicable utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. If the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, the PHA shall pay such excess amount (the utility reimbursement) either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family.</P>
              <P>(4) The PHA may elect to establish policies regarding the frequency of utility reimbursement payments for payments made to the family.</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA will have the option of making utility reimbursement payments not less than once per calendar-year quarter, for reimbursements totaling $45 or less per quarter. In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the PHA must reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier, the PHA must notify the family of the amount of utility reimbursement paid to the utility supplier.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Ceiling rent.</E> A PHA using ceiling rents authorized and established before October 1, 1999, may continue to use ceiling rents, provided such ceiling rents are set at the level required for flat rents under this section. PHAs must follow the requirements for calculating and adjusting flat rents in <PRTPAGE P="411"/>paragraph (b) of this section when calculating and adjusting ceiling rents.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Information for families.</E> For the family to make an informed choice about its rent options, the PHA must provide sufficient information for an informed choice. Such information must include at least the following written information:</P>
              <P>(1) The PHA's policies on switching type of rent in circumstances of financial hardship, and</P>
              <P>(2) The dollar amounts of tenant rent for the family under each option, following the procedures in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Choice between flat and income-based rents.</E> Families must be offered the choice between a flat rental amount and a previously calculated income-based rent according to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) For a family that chooses the flat rent option, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least once every three years.</P>
              <P>(2) At initial occupancy, or in any year in which a participating family is paying the income-based rent, the PHA must:</P>
              <P>(i) Conduct a full examination of family income and composition, following the provisions in § 960.257;</P>
              <P>(ii) Inform the family of the flat rental amount and the income-based rental amount determined by the examination of family income and composition;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inform the family of the PHA's policies on switching rent types in circumstances of financial hardship; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Apply the family's rent decision at the next lease renewal.</P>
              <P>(3) In any year in which a family chooses the flat rent option but the PHA chooses not to conduct a full examination of family income and composition for the annual rent option under the authority of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the PHA must:</P>
              <P>(i) Use income information from the examination of family income and composition from the first annual rent option;</P>
              <P>(ii) Inform the family of the updated flat rental amount and the rental amount determined by the most recent examination of family income and composition;</P>
              <P>(iii) Inform the family of the PHA's policies on switching rent types in circumstances of financial hardship; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Apply the family's rent decision at the next lease renewal.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Switch from flat rent to income-based rent because of hardship.</E> (1) A family that is paying a flat rent may at any time request a switch to payment of income-based rent (before the next annual option to select the type of rent) if the family is unable to pay flat rent because of financial hardship. The PHA must adopt written policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship for the family.</P>
              <P>(2) If the PHA determines that the family is unable to pay the flat rent because of financial hardship, the PHA must immediately allow the requested switch to income-based rent. The PHA shall make the determination within a reasonable time after the family request.</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA policies for determining when payment of flat rent is a financial hardship must provide that financial hardship include the following situations:</P>
              <P>(i) The family has experienced a decrease in income because of changed circumstances, including loss or reduction of employment, death in the family, or reduction in or loss of earnings or other assistance;</P>
              <P>(ii) The family has experienced an increase in expenses, because of changed circumstances, for medical costs, child care, transportation, education, or similar items; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Such other situations determined by the PHA to be appropriate.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When PHA is required to conduct reexamination.</E> (1) For families who pay an income-based rent, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family income and composition at least annually and must make appropriate adjustments in the rent after consultation with the family and upon verification of the information.</P>
              <P>(2) For families who choose flat rents, the PHA must conduct a reexamination of family composition at least annually, and must conduct a reexamination of family income at least once every three years in accordance with the procedures in § 960.253(f).</P>
              <P>(3) For all families who include nonexempt individuals, as defined in § 960.601, the PHA must determine compliance once each twelve months with community service and self-sufficiency requirements in subpart F of this part.</P>
              <P>(4) The PHA may use the results of these reexaminations to require the family to move to an appropriate size unit.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interim reexaminations.</E> (1) A family may request an interim reexamination of family income or composition because of any changes since the last determination.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must make the interim reexamination within a reasonable time after the family request. The PHA must adopt policies prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Streamlined income determination</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A PHA may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of “fixed income”.</E> For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:</P>
              <P>(i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.</P>
              <P>(ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.</P>
              <P>(iii) Annuities or other retirement benefit programs, insurance policies, disability or death benefits, or other similar types of periodic receipts.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Method of streamlined income determination.</E> A PHA using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.</P>
              <P>(i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's sources of fixed income, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, the PHA may choose, but is not required, to make appropriate adjustments pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income individually. The PHA must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">COLA rate applied by PHAs.</E> PHAs using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific <PRTPAGE P="414"/>source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Triennial verification.</E> For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, a PHA must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PHA reexamination policies.</E> The PHA must adopt admission and occupancy policies concerning conduct of annual and interim reexaminations in accordance with this section, and shall conduct reexaminations in accordance with such policies. The PHA reexamination policies must be in accordance with the PHA plan.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Family release and consent.</E> (1) As a condition of admission to or continued assistance under the program, the PHA shall require the family head, and such other family members as the PHA designates, to execute a consent form (including any release and consent as required under § 5.230 of this title) authorizing any depository or private source of income, or any Federal, State or local agency, to furnish or release to the PHA or HUD such information as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary.</P>
              <P>(2) The use or disclosure of information obtained from a family or from another source pursuant to this release and consent shall be limited to purposes directly connected with administration of the program.</P>

              <P>(2) For a family with net assets equal to or less than $5,000, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration that it has net assets equal to or less than $5,000, without taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the declaration.</P>
              <P>(i) The declaration must state the amount of income the family expects to receive from such assets; this amount must be included in the family's income.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administration of qualifying community service or self-sufficiency activities for residents.</E> The PHA may administer qualifying community service or economic self-sufficiency activities directly, or may make such activities available through a contractor, or through partnerships with qualified organizations, including resident organizations, and community agencies or institutions.</P>

              <P>(a) The policies and procedures contained in this part apply to any PHA that has a Public Housing Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD. This part, except for subpart E, does not apply to PHAs with housing assistance payments contracts with HUD under section 8 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.</P>
              <P>(b) Subpart B of this part contains HUD policies, procedures, and requirements for the participation of residents in public housing operations. These policies, procedures, and requirements apply to all residents participating under this part.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) Subpart C of this part contains HUD policies, procedures, and requirements for residents participating in the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) (replaces the Resident Management Program under Section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937). Resident management in public housing is viable and remains an option under TOP.</P>
              <P>(2) Subpart C of this part is not intended to negate any pre-existing arrangements for resident management in public housing between a PHA and a resident management corporation. On or after September 23, 1994, any new, renewed or renegotiated contracts must meet the requirements of this part, the ACC and all applicable laws and regulations.</P>
              <P>(d) Subpart D of this part includes requirements for the Family Investment Centers (FIC) Program which was established by Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) to provide families living in public housing and Indian housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities.</P>
              <P>(e) Subpart E of this part implements section 2(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437), which provides for resident membership on the board of directors or similar governing body of a PHA. Subpart E applies to any public housing agency that has a public housing annual contributions contract with HUD or administers tenant-based rental under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).</P>
              <P>(f) The term “resident,” as used throughout this part, is interchangeable with the term “tenant,” to reflect the fact that local resident organizations have differing preferences for the terms. Terms such as “resident council” and “tenant council” and “resident management” and “tenant management” are interchangeable. Hereafter, for ease of discussion, the rule will use the terms resident, resident council and resident management corporation, as appropriate.</P>

If a HA fails to negotiate with a resident council in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses to permit such usage of community space, the resident council may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing copies of relevant materials evidencing the resident council's efforts to negotiate a written agreement. HUD shall require the HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the request or for refusing to negotiate.

This will guarantee the resources necessary to create a bona fide partnership among the duly elected resident councils, the HA and HUD.

              <P>(2) If funds are available through appropriations, the HA must provide tenant services funding to the duly elected resident councils regardless of the HA's financial status. The resident council funds shall not be impacted or restricted by the HA financial status and all said funds must be used for the purpose set forth in subparts B and C of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) The HA and the duly elected resident council at each development and/or those jurisdiction-wide councils shall collaborate on how the funds will be distributed for tenant participation activities. If disputes regarding funding decisions arise between the parties, the matter shall be referred to the Field Office for intervention. HUD Field Office shall require the parties to undertake further negotiations to resolve the dispute. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date of the Field Office intervention, the Field Office shall refer the matter to HUD Headquarters for final resolution.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Stipends.</E> (1) HUD encourages HAs to provide stipends to resident council officers who serve as volunteers in their public housing developments. The amount of the stipend, up to $200 per month/per officer, shall be decided locally by the resident council and the HA. Subject to appropriations, the stipends will be funded from the resident council's portion of the operating subsidy funding for resident council expenses ($15.00 per unit per year).<PRTPAGE P="431"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Pursuant to § 913.106, stipends are not to be construed as salaries and should not be included as income for calculation of rents, and are not subject to conflict of interest requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) Funding provided by a HA to a duly elected resident council may be made only under a written agreement between the HA and a resident council, which includes a resident council budget and assurance that all resident council expenditures will not contravene provisions of law and will promote serviceability, efficiency, economy and stability in the operation of the local development. The agreement must require the local resident council to account to the HA for the use of the funds and permit the HA to inspect and audit the resident council's financial records related to the agreement.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Resident management requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The following requirements apply when a HA and its residents are interested in providing for resident performance of several management functions in one or more projects.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Resident management corporation responsibilities.</E> Resident councils interested in contracting with a HA must establish a resident management corporation that meets the requirements for such a corporation, as specified in subpart B. The RMC and its employees must demonstrate their ability and skill to perform in the particular areas of management pursuant to the management contract.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">HA responsibilities.</E> HAs shall give full and serious consideration to resident management corporations seeking <PRTPAGE P="433"/>to enter into a management contract with the HA. A HA shall enter into good-faith negotiations with a corporation seeking to contract to provide management services.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Duty to bargain in good faith.</E> If a HA refuses to negotiate with a resident management corporation in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses to enter into a contract, the corporation may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing copies of relevant materials evidencing the corporation's efforts to negotiate a contract. HUD shall require the HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the corporation's contract offer or for refusing to negotiate. Thereafter, HUD shall require the parties (with or without direct HUD participation) to undertake or to resume negotiations on a contract providing for resident management, and shall take such other actions as are necessary to resolve the conflicts between the parties. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Management contract.</E> A management contract between the HA and a resident management corporation is required for property management. The HA and the resident management corporation may agree to the performance by the corporation of any or all management functions for which the HA is responsible to HUD under the ACC and any other functions not inconsistent with the ACC and applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procurement requirements.</E> The management contract shall be treated as a contracting out of services, and must be subject to any provision of a collective bargaining agreement regarding the contracting out of services to which the HA is subject. Provisions on competitive bidding and requirements of prior written HUD approval of contracts contained in the ACC do not apply to the decision of a HA to contract with a RMC.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Rights of families; operation of project.</E> If a resident management corporation is approved by the tenant organization representing one or more buildings or an area of row houses that are part of a public housing project for purposes of part 941 of this chapter, the resident management program may not, as determined by the HA, interfere with the rights of other residents of such project or harm the efficient operation of such project.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Comprehensive improvement assistance with RMCs.</E> (1) The HA may enter into a contract with the RMC to provide comprehensive improvement assistance under part 968 of this chapter to modernize a project managed by the RMC.</P>
              <P>(2) The HA shall not retain, for any administrative or other reason, any portion of the comprehensive improvement assistance provided, unless the PHA and the RMC provide otherwise by contract.</P>
              <P>(3) In assessing the modernization needs of its projects under 24 CFR part 968, or other grant mechanisms established by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the HAs must consult with the tenant management corporation regarding any project managed by the corporation, in order to determine the modernization needs and preferences of resident-managed projects. Evidence of this required consultation must be included with a HA's initial submission to HUD.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Direct provision of operating and capital assistance to RMC</E>—(1) <E T="03">Direct provision of assistance to RMC.</E> The ACC shall provide for the direct provision of operating and capital assistance by HUD to an RMC if:</P>
              <P>(i) The RMC petitions HUD for the release of funds;</P>
              <P>(ii) The contract provides for the RMC to assume the primary management responsibilities of the PHA;</P>
              <P>(iii) The RMC has been designated as at least a “standard performer” under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) (see 24 CFR part 902); and</P>

              <P>(iv) The RMC is not in violation of any financial, accounting, procurement, civil rights, fair housing or other <PRTPAGE P="434"/>program requirements that HUD determines call into question the capability of the RMC to effectively discharge its responsibilities under the contract.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Use of assistance.</E> Any direct capital or operating assistance provided to the RMC must be used for purposes of performing eligible activities with respect to public housing as may be provided under the contract.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Responsibilities of PHA.</E> If HUD provides direct funding to a RMC under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the PHA is not responsible for the actions of the RMC.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Prohibited activities.</E> A HA may not contract for assumption by the resident management corporation of the HA's underlying responsibilities to HUD under the ACC.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Bonding, insurance, and licensing</E>—(1) <E T="03">Bonding and insurance.</E> Before assuming any management responsibility under its contract, the RMC must provide fidelity bonding and insurance, or equivalent protection that is adequate (as determined by HUD and the PHA) to protect HUD and the PHA against loss, theft, embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the RMC or its employees.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Licensing and other local requirements.</E> An RMC must be in compliance with any local licensing, or other local requirement, governing the qualifications or operations of a property manager.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Waiver of HUD requirements.</E> Upon the joint request of a resident management corporation and the HA, HUD may waive any requirement that HUD has established and that is not required by law, if HUD determines, after consultation with the resident management corporation and the HA, that the requirement unnecessarily increases the costs to the project or restricts the income of the project; and that the waiver would be consistent with the management contract and any applicable collective bargaining agreement. Any waiver granted to a resident management corporation under this section will apply as well to the HA to the extent the waiver affects the HA's remaining responsibilities relating to the resident management corporation's project.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Monitoring of RMC performance.</E> The HA must review periodically (but not less than annually) the management corporation's performance to ensure that it complies with all applicable requirements and meets agreed-upon standards of performance. (The method of review and criteria used to judge performance should be specified in the management contract.)</P>

              <P>(1) Grant recipients must comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, as applicable.</P>

A written report of the audit must be forwarded to HUD within 60 days of issuance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Resident management corporations.</E> Resident management corporations who have entered into a contract with a HA with respect to management of a development(s) must comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, as applicable. Resident management corporations managing a development(s) must be audited annually by a licensed certified public accountant, designated by the corporation, in accordance with generally accepted government audit standards. A written report of each audit must be forwarded to HUD and the HA within 30 days of issuance. These requirements are in addition to any other Federal law or other requirement that would apply to the availability and audit of books and records of resident management corporations under this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Preemption of State prevailing wage requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A prevailing wage rate including basic hourly rate and any fringe benefits) determined under State law shall be inapplicable to a contract or PHA-performed work item for the development, maintenance, and modernization of a project whenever:</P>
              <P>(1) The contract or work item: (i) Is otherwise subject to State law requiring the payment of wage rates determined by a State or local government or agency to be prevailing and (ii) is assisted with funds for low-income public housing under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended; and</P>
              <P>(2) The wage rate determined under State law to be prevailing with respect to an employee in any trade or position employed in the development, maintenance, and modernization of a project exceeds whichever of the following Federal wage rates is applicable:</P>

              <P>(i) The wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a <E T="03">et seq.</E>) to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trade;</P>
              <P>(ii) An applicable apprentice wage rate based thereon specified in an apprenticeship program registered with the Department of Labor or a DOL-recognized State Apprenticeship Agency;</P>
              <P>(iii) An applicable trainee wage rate based thereon specified in a DOL-certified trainee program; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The wage rate determined by the Secretary of HUD to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trade or position.</P>

              <P>(v) For the purpose of ascertaining whether a wage rate determined under State law for a trade or position exceeds the Federal wage rate: (A) Where <PRTPAGE P="441"/>a rate determined by the Secretary of Labor or an apprentice or trainee wage rate based thereon is applicable, the total wage rate determined under State law, including fringe benefits (if any) and basic hourly rate, shall be compared to the total wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor or apprentice or trainee wage rate; and (B) where a rate determined by the Secretary of HUD is applicable, any fringe benefits determined under State law shall be excluded from the comparison with the rate determined by the Secretary of HUD.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever paragraph (a)(1) of this section is applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Any solicitation of bids or proposals issued by the PHA and any contract executed by the PHA for development, maintenance, and modernization of the project shall include a statement that any prevailing wage rate (including basic hourly rate and any fringe benefits) determined under State law to be prevailing with respect to an employee in any trade or position employed under the contract is inapplicable to the contract and shall not be enforced against the contractor or any subcontractor with respect to employees engaged under the contract whenever either of the following occurs:</P>

              <P>(i) Such nonfederal prevailing wage rate exceeds: (A) The applicable wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a <E T="03">et seq.</E>) to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trade; (B) an applicable apprentice wage rate based thereon specified in an apprenticeship program registered with the Department of Labor or a DOL-recognized State Apprenticeship Agency or (C) an applicable trainee wage rate based thereon specified in a DOL-certified trainee program; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Such nonfederal prevailing wage rate, exclusive of any fringe benefits, exceeds the applicable wage rate determined by the Secretary of HUD to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trade or position.</P>
              <FP>Failure to include this statement may constitute grounds for requiring resolicitation of the bid or proposal;</FP>
              <P>(2) The PHA itself shall not be required to pay the basic hourly rate or any fringe benefits comprising a prevailing wage rate determined under State law and described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to any of its own employees who may be engaged in the work item for development, maintenance, and modernization of the project; and</P>
              <P>(3) Neither the basic hourly rate nor any fringe benefits comprising a prevailing wage rate determined under State law and described in paragraph (a)(2) shall be enforced against the PHA or any of its contractors or subcontractors with respect to employees engaged in the contract or PHA-performed work item for development, maintenance, and modernization of the project.</P>
              <P>(c) Nothing in this section shall affect the applicability of any wage rate established in a collective bargaining agreement with a PHA or its contractors or subcontractors where such wage rate equals or exceeds the applicable Federal wage rate referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, nor does this section impose a ceiling on wage rates a PHA or its contractors or subcontractors may choose to pay independent of State law.</P>
              <P>(d) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to work performed under any prime contract entered into as a result of a solicitation of bids or proposals issued on or after October 6, 1988 and to any work performed by employees of a PHA on or after October 6, 1988, but not to work or contracts administered by Indian Housing Authorities (for which, see part 905 of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this subpart is to implement policies concerning insurance coverage required <PRTPAGE P="442"/>under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and a Public Housing Agency (PHA).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The provisions of this subpart apply to all housing owned by PHAs, including Turnkey III housing. However, these provisions do not apply to Section 23 and Section 10(c) PHA-leased projects or to Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program projects.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Qualified PHA-owned insurance entity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Contractual requirements for insurance coverage.</E> The Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) between PHAs and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires that PHAs maintain specified insurance coverage for property and casualty losses that would jeopardize the financial stability of the PHAs. The insurance coverage is required to be obtained under procedures that provide “for open and competitive bidding.” The HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provided that a PHA could purchase insurance coverage without regard to competitive selection procedures when it purchases it from a nonprofit insurance entity owned and controlled by PHAs approved by HUD in accordance with standards established by regulation. This section specifies the standards.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Method of selecting insurance coverage.</E> While 2 CFR 200.319 requires that grantees solicit full and open competition for their procurements, the HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992 provides an exception to this requirement. PHAs are authorized to obtain any line of insurance from a nonprofit insurance entity that is owned and controlled by PHAs and approved by HUD in accordance with this section, without regard to competitive selection procedures. Procurement of insurance from other entities is subject to competitive selection procedures.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Approval of a nonprofit insurance entity.</E> Under the following conditions, HUD will approve a nonprofit self-funded insurance entity created by PHAs that limits participation to PHAs (and to nonprofit entities associated with PHAs that engage in activities or perform functions only for housing authorities or housing authority residents):</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">An insurance company (including a risk retention group).</E> (i) The insurance company is licensed or authorized to do business in the State by the State Insurance Commissioner and has submitted documentation of this approval to HUD; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The insurance company has not been suspended from providing insurance coverage in the State or been suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal government. The insurance company is obligated to send to HUD a copy of any action taken by the authorizing official to withdraw the license or authorization.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">An entity not organized as an insurance company.</E> (i) The entity has competent underwriting staff (hired directly or engaged by contract with a third party), as evidenced by professionals with an average of at least five years of experience in large risk (exceeding $100,000 in annual premiums) commercial underwriting or at least five years of experience in the underwriting of risks for public entity risk pools. This standard may be satisfied by submission of evidence of competent underwriting staff, including copies of resumes of underwriting staff for the entity;</P>
              <P>(ii) The entity has efficient and qualified management (hired directly or engaged by contract with a third party), as evidenced by the report submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section and by having at least one senior staff person who has a minimum of five years of experience:</P>
              <P>(A) At the management level of Vice President of a property/casualty insurance entity;</P>
              <P>(B) As a senior branch manager of a branch office with annual property/casualty premiums exceeding $5 million; or</P>

              <P>(C) As a senior manager of a public entity risk pool. Documentation for this standard must include copies of resumes of key management personnel responsible for oversight and for the day-to-day operation of the entity;<PRTPAGE P="443"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) The entity maintains internal controls and cost containment measures, as evidenced by an annual budget;</P>
              <P>(iv) The entity maintains sound investments consistent with the State insurance commissioner's requirements for licensed insurance companies, or other State statutory requirements controlling investments of public entities, in the State in which the entity is organized, investing only in assets that qualify as “admitted assets”;</P>
              <P>(v) The entity maintains adequate surplus and reserves for undischarged liabilities of all types, as evidenced by a current audited financial statement and an actuarial review conducted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Upon application for initial approval, the entity has proper organizational documentation, as evidenced by copies of the articles of incorporation, by-laws, business plans, copies of contracts with third party administrators, and an opinion from legal counsel that establishment of the entity conforms with all legal requirements under Federal and State law. Any material changes made to these documents after initial approval must be submitted for review and approval before becoming effective.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Professional evaluations of performance.</E> Audits and actuarial reviews are required to be prepared and submitted annually to the HUD Office of Public and Indian Housing, for review and appropriate action, by nonprofit insurance entities that are not insurance companies approved under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In addition, an evaluation of other management factors is required to be performed by an insurance professional every three years. For fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 1993, the initial audit, actuarial review, and insurance management review required for a nonprofit insurance entity must be submitted to HUD within 90 days after the entity's fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(1) The annual financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (including any supplementary data required under GASB 10) is to be audited by an independent auditor (see 2 CFR part 200, subpart F), in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The independent auditor shall express an opinion on whether the entity's financial statement is presented fairly in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A copy of this audit must be submitted to HUD.</P>
              <P>(2) The actuarial review must be done consistent with requirements established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and must be conducted by an independent property/casualty actuary who is an Associate or Fellow of a recognized professional actuarial organization, such as the Casualty Actuary Society. The report issued, a copy of which must be submitted to HUD, must include an opinion on any over or under reserving and the adequacy of the reserves maintained for the open claims and for incurred but unreported claims.</P>
              <P>(3) A review must be conducted, a copy of which must be submitted to HUD, by an independent insurance consulting firm that has at least one person on staff who has received the professional designation of chartered property/casualty underwriter (CPCU), associate in risk management (ARM), or associate in claims (AIC), of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Efficiency of any Third Party Administrator;</P>
              <P>(ii) Timeliness of the claim payments and reserving practices; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The adequacy of reinsurance coverage.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Revocation of approval of a nonprofit insurance entity.</E> HUD may revoke its approval of a nonprofit insurance entity under this section when it no longer meets the requirements of this section. The nonprofit insurance entity will be notified in writing of: the proposed revocation of its approval, the reasons for the action, and the manner and time in which to request a hearing to challenge the determination. The procedure to be followed is specified in 24 CFR part 26, subpart A.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Lead-based paint liability insurance coverage.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The purpose of this section is to specify what HUD deems reasonable insurance coverage with respect to the hazards associated with lead-based paint activities that the PHA undertakes, in accordance with the PHA's ACC with HUD. The insurance coverage does not relieve the PHA of its responsibility for assuring that lead-based paint activities are conducted in a responsible manner.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Insurance coverage requirements.</E> When the PHA undertakes lead-based paint activities, it must assure that it has reasonable insurance coverage for itself for potential personal injury liability associated with those activities. If the work is being done by PHA employees, the PHA must obtain a liability insurance policy directly to protect the PHA. If the work is being done by a contractor, the PHA must obtain, from the insurer of the contractor performing this type of work in accordance with a contract, a certificate of insurance providing evidence of such insurance and naming the PHA as an additional insured; or obtain such insurance directly. Insurance must remain in effect during the entire period of lead-based paint activity and must comply with the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Named insured.</E> If purchased by the PHA, the policy shall name the PHA as insured. If purchased by an independent contractor, the policy shall name the contractor as insured and the PHA as an additional insured, in connection with performing work under the PHA's contract pertaining to lead-based paint activities. If the PHA has executed a contract with a Resident Management Corporation (RMC) to manage a building/project on behalf of the PHA, the RMC shall be an additional insured under the policy in connection with the PHA's contract related to lead-based paint activities. (The duties of the RMC are similar to those of a real estate management firm.)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Coverage limits.</E> The minimum limit of liability shall be $500,000 per occurrence written, with a combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Deductible.</E> A deductible, if any, may not exceed $5,000 per occurrence.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Supplementary payments.</E> Payments for such supplementary costs as the costs of defending against a claim must be in addition to, and not as a reduction of, the limit of liability. However, it will be permissible for the policy to have a limit on the amount payable for defense costs. If a limit is applicable, it must not be less than $250,000 per claim prior to such costs being deducted from the limit of liability.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Occurrence form policy.</E> The form used must be an “occurrence” form, or a “claims made” form that contains an extended reporting period of at least five years. (Under an occurrence form, coverage applies to any loss regardless of when the claim is made.)</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Aggregate limit.</E> If the policy contains an aggregate limit, the minimum acceptable limit is $1,000,000.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Cancellation.</E> In the event of cancellation, at least 30 days' advance notice is to be given to the insured and any additional insured.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exception to requirements.</E> Insurance already purchased by the PHA or contractor and enforced on the day this section is effective which provides coverage for lead-based paint activities shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this section until the expiration of the policy. This section is not applicable to architects, engineers or consultants who do not physically perform lead-based paint activities.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Insurance for the existence of lead-based paint hazards.</E> A PHA may also purchase special liability insurance against the existence of lead-based paint hazards, although it is not a required coverage. A PHA may purchase this coverage if, in the opinion of the PHA, the policy meets the PHA's requirements, the premium is reasonable and the policy is obtained in accordance with applicable procurement standards. (See 2 CFR part 200 and § 965.205 of this title.) If this coverage is purchased, the premium must be paid from funds available under the Performance Funding System or from reserves.</P>

              <P>Within the funds available to a PHA, energy conservation measures should be accomplished with the shortest pay-back periods funded first. A PHA may make adjustments to this funding order because of insufficient funds to accomplish high-cost energy conservation measures (ECM) or where an ECM with a longer pay-back period can be more efficiently installed in conjunction with other planned modernization. A PHA may not install individual utility meters that measure the energy or fuel used for space heating in dwelling units that need substantial weatherization, when installation of meters would result in economic hardship for residents. In these cases, the ECMs related to weatherization shall be accomplished before the installation of individual utility meters.</P>

              <P>(b) If a PHA finances energy conservation measures from sources other than modernization or operating reserves, such as a loan from a utility entity or a guaranteed savings agreement with a private energy service company, HUD may agree to provide adjustments in its calculation of the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility under the PFS for the project and utility involved based on a determination that payments can be funded from the reasonably anticipated energy cost savings (See § 990.107(g) of this chapter).</P>

              <P>(a) In projects for which retail service is provided by the utility supplier and the PHA is paying all the individual utility bills, no benefit/cost analysis is necessary, and residents shall be billed directly after the PHA <PRTPAGE P="447"/>adopts revised payment schedules providing appropriate allowances for resident-supplied utilities.</P>
              <P>(b) In projects for which checkmeters have been installed but are not being utilized as the basis for determining utility charges to the residents, no benefit/cost analysis is necessary. The checkmeters shall be used as the basis for utility charges, and residents shall be surcharged for excess utility use.</P>
              <P>(c) Projects for which meter loops have been installed for utilization of checkmeters shall be analyzed both for the installation of checkmeters and for conversion to retail service.</P>
              <P>(d) Low- or medium-rise family units with a mastermeter system should be analyzed for both checkmetering and conversion to retail service, because of their large potential for energy savings.</P>
              <P>(e) Low- or medium-rise housing for the elderly should next be analyzed for both checkmetering and conversion to retail service, since the potential for energy saving is less than for family units.</P>
              <P>(f) Electric service under mastermeters for high-rise buildings, including projects for the elderly, should be analyzed for both use of retail service and of checkmeters.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Actions affecting residents.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before making any conversion to retail service, the PHA shall adopt revised payment schedules, providing appropriate allowances for the resident-supplied utilities resulting from the conversion.</P>
              <P>(b) Before implementing any modifications to utility services arrangements with the residents or charges with respect thereto, the PHA shall make the requisite changes in resident dwelling leases in accordance with 24 CFR part 966.</P>
              <P>(c) PHAs must work closely with resident organizations, to the extent practicable, in making plans for conversion of utility service to individual metering, explaining the national policy objectives of energy conservation, the changes in charges and rent structure that will result, and the goals of achieving an equitable structure that will be advantageous to residents who conserve energy.</P>
              <P>(d) A transition period of at least six months shall be provided in the case of initiation of checkmeters, during which residents will be advised of the charges but during which no surcharge will be made based on the readings. This trial period will afford residents ample notice of the effects the checkmetering system will have on their individual utility charges and also afford a test period for the adequacy of the utility allowances established.</P>
              <P>(e) During and after the transition period, PHAs shall advise and assist residents with high utility consumption on methods for reducing their usage. This advice and assistance may include counseling, installation of new energy conserving equipment or appliances, and corrective maintenance.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Standards for allowances for utilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The objective of a PHA in designing methods of establishing utility allowances for each dwelling unit category and unit size shall be to approximate a reasonable consumption of utilities by an energy-conservative household of modest circumstances consistent with the requirements of a safe, sanitary, and healthful living environment.</P>

              <P>(b) Allowances for both PHA-furnished and resident-purchased utilities shall be designed to include such reasonable consumption for major equipment or for utility functions furnished <PRTPAGE P="449"/>by the PHA for all residents (e.g., heating furnace, hot water heater), for essential equipment whether or not furnished by the PHA (e.g., range and refrigerator), and for minor items of equipment (such as toasters and radios) furnished by residents.</P>
              <P>(c) The complexity and elaborateness of the methods chosen by the PHA, in its discretion, to achieve the foregoing objective will depend upon the nature of the housing stock, data available to the PHA and the extent of the administrative resources reasonably available to the PHA to be devoted to the collection of such data, the formulation of methods of calculation, and actual calculation and monitoring of the allowances.</P>
              <P>(d) In establishing allowances, the PHA shall take into account relevant factors affecting consumption requirements, including:</P>
              <P>(1) The equipment and functions intended to be covered by the allowance for which the utility will be used. For instance, natural gas may be used for cooking, heating domestic water, or space heating, or any combination of the three;</P>
              <P>(2) The climatic location of the housing projects;</P>
              <P>(3) The size of the dwelling units and the number of occupants per dwelling unit;</P>
              <P>(4) Type of construction and design of the housing project;</P>
              <P>(5) The energy efficiency of PHA-supplied appliances and equipment;</P>
              <P>(6) The utility consumption requirements of appliances and equipment whose reasonable consumption is intended to be covered by the total resident payment;</P>
              <P>(7) The physical condition, including insulation and weatherization, of the housing project;</P>
              <P>(8) Temperature levels intended to be maintained in the unit during the day and at night, and in cold and warm weather; and</P>
              <P>(9) Temperature of domestic hot water.</P>
              <P>(e) If a PHA installs air conditioning, it shall provide, to the maximum extent economically feasible, systems that give residents the option of choosing to use air conditioning in their units. The design of systems that offer each resident the option to choose air conditioning shall include retail meters or checkmeters, and residents shall pay for the energy used in its operation. For systems that offer residents the option to choose air conditioning, the PHA shall not include air conditioning in the utility allowances. For systems that offer residents the option to choose air conditioning but cannot be checkmetered, residents are to be surcharged in accordance with § 965.506. If an air conditioning system does not provide for resident option, residents are not to be charged, and these systems should be avoided whenever possible.</P>

              <P>(a) For dwelling units subject to allowances for PHA-furnished utilities where checkmeters have been installed, the PHA shall establish surcharges for utility consumption in excess of the allowances. Surcharges may be computed on a straight per unit of purchase basis (e.g., cents per kilowatt hour of electricity) or for stated blocks of excess consumption, and shall be based on the PHA's average utility rate. The basis for calculating such surcharges shall be described in the PHA's schedule of allowances. Changes in the dollar amounts of surcharges based directly on changes in the PHA's average utility rate shall not be subject to the advance notice requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) For dwelling units served by PHA-furnished utilities where checkmeters have not been installed, the PHA shall establish schedules of surcharges indicating additional dollar amounts residents will be required to pay by reason of estimated utility consumption attributable to resident-owned major appliances or to optional functions of PHA-furnished equipment. Such surcharge schedules shall state the resident-owned equipment (or functions of PHA-furnished equipment) for which surcharges shall be made and the amounts of such charges, which shall be based on the cost to the PHA of the utility consumption estimated to be attributable to reasonable usage of such equipment.</P>

The review shall include all changes in circumstances (including completion of modernization and/or other energy conservation measures implemented by the PHA) indicating probability of a significant change in reasonable consumption requirements and changes in utility rates.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Revision as a result of rate changes.</E> The PHA may revise its allowances for resident-purchased utilities between annual reviews if there is a rate change (including fuel adjustments) and shall be required to do so if such change, by itself or together with prior rate changes not adjusted for, results in a change of 10 percent or more from the rates on which such allowances were based. Adjustments to resident payments as a result of such changes shall be retroactive to the first day of the month following the month in which the last rate change taken into account in such revision became effective.

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Funding.</E> PHAs shall use operating funds to provide battery-operated smoke detectors in units that do not have any smoke detector in place. If operating funds or reserves are insufficient to accomplish this, PHAs may apply for emergency CIAP funding. The PHAs may apply for CIAP or CGP funds to replace battery-operated smoke detectors with hard-wired smoke detectors in the normal course of a planned modernization program.</P>

              <P>A lease shall be entered into between the PHA and each tenant of a dwelling unit which shall contain the provisions described hereinafter.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Parties, dwelling unit and term.</E> (1) The lease shall state:</P>
              <P>(i) The names of the PHA and the tenant;</P>
              <P>(ii) The unit rented (address, apartment number, and any other information needed to identify the dwelling unit);</P>
              <P>(iii) The term of the lease (lease term and renewal in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section);</P>
              <P>(iv) A statement of what utilities, services, and equipment are to be supplied by the PHA without additional cost, and what utilities and appliances are to be paid for by the tenant;</P>

              <P>(v) The composition of the household as approved by the PHA (family members and any PHA-approved live-in aide). The family must promptly inform the PHA of the birth, adoption, or <PRTPAGE P="453"/>court-awarded custody of a child. The family must request PHA approval to add any other family member as an occupant of the unit;</P>
              <P>(vi) HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Lease term and renewal.</E> (i) The lease shall have a twelve month term. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the lease term must be automatically renewed for the same period.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may not renew the lease if the family has violated the requirement for resident performance of community service or participation in an economic self-sufficiency program in accordance with part 960, subpart F of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) At any time, the PHA may terminate the tenancy in accordance with § 966.4(l).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Execution and modification.</E> The lease must be executed by the tenant and the PHA, except for automatic renewals of a lease. The lease may modified at any time by written agreement of the tenant and the PHA.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Payments due under the lease</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tenant rent.</E> (i) The tenant shall pay the amount of the monthly tenant rent determined by the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and other requirements. The amount of the tenant rent is subject to change in accordance with HUD requirements.</P>
              <P>(ii) The lease shall specify the initial amount of the tenant rent at the beginning of the initial lease term. The PHA shall give the tenant written notice stating any change in the amount of tenant rent, and when the change is effective.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">PHA charges.</E> The lease shall provide for charges to the tenant for maintenance and repair beyond normal wear and tear and for consumption of excess utilities. The lease shall state the basis for the determination of such charges (e.g., by a posted schedule of charges for repair, amounts charged for utility consumption in excess of the allowance stated in the lease, etc.). The imposition of charges for consumption of excess utilities is permissible only if such charges are determined by an individual check meter servicing the leased unit or result from the use of major tenant-supplied appliances.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Late payment penalties.</E> At the option of the PHA, the lease may provide for payment of penalties for late payment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">When charges are due.</E> The lease shall provide that charges assessed under paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section shall not be due and collectible until two weeks after the PHA gives written notice of the charges. Such notice constitutes a notice of adverse action, and must meet the requirements governing a notice of adverse action (see § 966.4(e)(8)).</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Security deposits.</E> At the option of the PHA, the lease may provide for security deposits which shall not exceed one month's rent or such reasonable fixed amount as may be required by the PHA. Provision may be made for gradual accumulation of the security deposit by the tenant. Subject to applicable laws, interest earned on security deposits may be refunded to the tenant on vacation of the dwelling unit or used for tenant services or activities.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Redetermination of rent and family composition.</E> The lease shall provide for redetermination of rent and family composition which shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The frequency of regular rental redetermination and the basis for interim redetermination.</P>
              <P>(2) An agreement by the tenant to furnish such information and certifications regarding family composition and income as may be necessary for the PHA to make determinations with respect to rent, eligibility, and the appropriateness of dwelling size.</P>
              <P>(3) An agreement by the tenant to transfer to an appropriate size dwelling unit based on family composition, upon appropriate notice by the PHA that such a dwelling unit is available.</P>

              <P>(4) When the PHA redetermines the amount of rent (Total Tenant Payment or Tenant Rent) payable by the tenant, not including determination of the PHA's schedule of Utility Allowances for families in the PHA's Public Housing Program, or determines that the tenant must transfer to another unit based on family composition, the PHA shall notify the tenant that the tenant may ask for an explanation stating the <PRTPAGE P="454"/>specific grounds of the PHA determination, and that if the tenant does not agree with the determination, the tenant shall have the right to request a hearing under the PHA grievance procedure.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Tenant's right to use and occupancy.</E> (1) The lease shall provide that the tenant shall have the right to exclusive use and occupancy of the leased unit by the members of the household authorized to reside in the unit in accordance with the lease, including reasonable accommodation of their guests.

              <P>(2) With the consent of the PHA, members of the household may engage in legal profitmaking activities in the dwelling unit, where the PHA determines that such activities are incidental to primary use of the leased unit for residence by members of the household.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) With the consent of the PHA, a foster child or a live-in aide may reside in the unit. The PHA may adopt reasonable policies concerning residence by a foster child or a live-in-aide, and defining the circumstances in which PHA consent will be given or denied. Under such policies, the factors considered by the PHA may include:</P>
              <P>(A) Whether the addition of a new occupant may necessitate a transfer of the family to another unit, and whether such units are available.</P>
              <P>(B) The PHA's obligation to make reasonable accommodation for handicapped persons.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Live-in aide</E> means a person who resides with an elderly, disabled or handicapped person and who:</P>
              <P>(A) Is determined to be essential to the care and well-being of the person;</P>
              <P>(B) Is not obligated for the support of the person; and</P>
              <P>(C) Would not be living in the unit except to provide the necessary supportive services.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">The PHA's obligations.</E> The lease shall set forth the PHA's obligations under the lease, which shall include the following:</P>

              <P>(2) To comply with requirements of applicable building codes, housing codes, and HUD regulations materially affecting health and safety;</P>
              <P>(3) To make necessary repairs to the dwelling unit;</P>
              <P>(4) To keep project buildings, facilities, and common areas, not otherwise assigned to the tenant for maintenance and upkeep, in a clean and safe condition;</P>

              <P>(7) To supply running water and reasonable amounts of hot water and reasonable amounts of heat at appropriate times of the year (according to local custom and usage), except where the building that includes the dwelling unit is not required by law to be equipped for that purpose, or where heat or hot water is generated by an installation within the exclusive control of the tenant and supplied by a direct utility connection; and</P>
              <P>(8)(i) To notify the tenant of the specific grounds for any proposed adverse action by the PHA.

              </P>
              <P>(B) In the case of a proposed adverse action other than a proposed lease termination, the PHA shall not take the proposed action until the time for the tenant to request a grievance hearing has expired, and (if a hearing was timely requested by the tenant) the grievance process has been completed.</P>
              <P>(9) To consider lease bifurcation, as provided in 24 CFR 5.2009, in circumstances involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking addressed in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), provided that, if a PHA chooses to bifurcate a lease, no assistance will be given for an individual who does not meet public housing eligibility and 24 CFR 5.508(h)(2) applies to submission of evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Tenant's obligations.</E> The lease shall provide that the tenant shall be obligated:</P>

              <P>(E) Failure to accept the PHA's offer of a lease revision to an existing lease: that is on a form adopted by the PHA in accordance with § 966.3; with written notice of the offer of the revision at least 60 calendar days before the lease revision is scheduled to take effect; and with the offer specifying a reasonable time limit within that period for acceptance by the family.</P>

              <P>(ii) The notice of lease termination to the tenant shall state specific grounds for termination, and shall inform the tenant of the tenant's right to make such reply as the tenant may wish. The notice shall also inform the tenant of the right (pursuant to § 966.4(m)) to examine PHA documents directly relevant to the termination or eviction. When the PHA is required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a grievance hearing, the notice shall also inform the tenant of the tenant's right to request a hearing in accordance with the PHA's grievance procedure.</P>
              <P>(iii) A notice to vacate which is required by State or local law may be combined with, or run concurrently with, a notice of lease termination under paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) When the PHA is required to afford the tenant the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA grievance procedure for a grievance concerning the lease termination (see § 966.51(a)(1)), the tenancy shall not terminate (even if any notice to vacate under State or local law has expired) until the time for the tenant to request a grievance hearing has expired, and (if a hearing was timely requested by the tenant) the grievance process has been completed.</P>

              <P>(4) <E T="03">How tenant is evicted.</E> The PHA may evict the tenant from the unit either:</P>
              <P>(i) By bringing a court action or;</P>
              <P>(ii) By bringing an administrative action if law of the jurisdiction permits eviction by administrative action, after a due process administrative hearing, and without a court determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. In order to evict without bringing a court action, the PHA must afford the tenant the opportunity for a pre-eviction hearing in accordance with the PHA grievance procedure.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">PHA termination of tenancy for criminal activity or alcohol abuse</E>—(i) <E T="03">Evicting drug criminals.</E> (A) <E T="03">Methamphetamine conviction.</E> The PHA must immediately terminate the tenancy if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Drug crime on or off the premises.</E> The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or off the premises by any tenant, member of the tenant's household or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the PHA to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that a PHA may evict a family when the PHA determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the PHA determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Evicting other criminals.</E> (A) <E T="03">Threat to other residents.</E> The lease must provide that any criminal activity by a covered person that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents (including PHA management staff residing on the premises) or threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises is grounds for termination of tenancy.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Fugitive felon or parole violator.</E> The PHA may terminate the tenancy if a tenant is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Eviction for criminal activity.</E> (A) <E T="03">Evidence.</E> The PHA may evict the tenant by judicial action for criminal activity in accordance with this section if the PHA determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Notice to Post Office.</E> When a PHA evicts an individual or family for criminal activity, the PHA must notify the local post office serving the dwelling unit that the individual or family is no longer residing in the unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Use of criminal record.</E> If the PHA seeks to terminate the tenancy for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record before a PHA grievance hearing or court trial concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant must be given an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in the grievance hearing or court trial.<PRTPAGE P="459"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Cost of obtaining criminal record.</E> The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Evicting alcohol abusers.</E> The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of tenancy if the PHA determines that a household member has:</P>
              <P>(A) Engaged in abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or</P>
              <P>(B) Furnished false or misleading information concerning illegal drug use, alcohol abuse, or rehabilitation of illegal drug users or alcohol abusers.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">PHA action, generally.</E> (A) <E T="03">Assessment under PHAS.</E> Under the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS), PHAs that have adopted policies, implemented procedures and can document that they appropriately evict any public housing residents who engage in certain activity detrimental to the public housing community receive points. (See 24 CFR 902.43(a)(5).) This policy takes into account the importance of eviction of such residents to public housing communities and program integrity, and the demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Consideration of circumstances.</E> In a manner consistent with such policies, procedures and practices, the PHA may consider all circumstances relevant to a particular case such as the seriousness of the offending action, the extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action, the effects that the eviction would have on family members not involved in the offending activity and the extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and has taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Exclusion of culpable household member.</E> The PHA may require a tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Consideration of rehabilitation.</E> In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use by a household member who is no longer engaging in such use, or for abuse or a pattern of abuse of alcohol by a household member who is no longer engaging in such abuse, the PHA may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13662). For this purpose, the PHA may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Length of period of mandatory prohibition on admission.</E> If a statute requires that the PHA prohibit admission of persons for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, the PHA may apply that prohibition for a longer period of time.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination limitation.</E> The PHA's eviction actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of § 5.105 of this title.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Eviction: Right to examine PHA documents before hearing or trial.</E> The PHA shall provide the tenant a reasonable opportunity to examine, at the tenant's request, before a PHA grievance hearing or court trial concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, any documents, including records and regulations, which are in the possession of the PHA, and which are directly relevant to the termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant shall be allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. A notice of lease termination pursuant to § 966.4(l) (3) shall inform the tenant of the tenant's right to examine PHA documents concerning the termination of tenancy or eviction. If the PHA does not make documents available for examination upon request by the tenant (in accordance with this § 966.4(m)), the PHA may not proceed with the eviction.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Grievance procedures.</E> (1) The lease must provide that all disputes concerning the obligations of the tenant or the PHA must (except as provided in § 966.51(a)(2)) be resolved in accordance with the PHA grievance procedures. <PRTPAGE P="460"/>The grievance procedures must comply with subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(2) The lease must include a description of the PHA's policies for selecting a hearing officer.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Provision for modifications.</E> The lease shall provide that modification of the lease must be accomplished by a written rider to the lease executed by both parties, except for paragraph (c) of this section and § 966.5.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Signature clause.</E> The lease shall provide a signature clause attesting that the lease has been executed by the parties.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the requirements, standards and criteria for a grievance procedure to be established and implemented by public housing agencies (PHAs) to assure that a PHA tenant is afforded an opportunity for a hearing if the tenant disputes within a reasonable time any PHA action or failure to act involving the tenant's lease with the PHA or PHA regulations which adversely affect the individual tenant's rights, duties, welfare or status.</P>

              <P>(a)(1) The PHA grievance procedure shall be applicable (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) to all individual grievances as defined in § 966.53 of this subpart between the tenant and the PHA.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) The term <E T="03">due process determination</E> means a determination by HUD that law of the jurisdiction requires that the tenant must be given the opportunity for a hearing in court which provides the basic elements of due process (as defined in § 966.53(c)) before eviction from the dwelling unit. If HUD has issued a due process determination, a PHA may exclude from the PHA administrative grievance procedure under this subpart any grievance concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction that involves:</P>
              <P>(A) Any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other residents or employees of the PHA;</P>
              <P>(B) Any violent or drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any criminal activity that resulted in felony conviction of a household member.</P>

              <P>(iii) For guidance of the public, HUD will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> a notice listing the judicial eviction procedures for which HUD has issued a due process determination. HUD will make available for public inspection and copying a copy of the legal analysis on which the determinations are based.</P>
              <P>(iv) If HUD has issued a due process determination, the PHA may evict the occupants of the dwelling unit through the judicial eviction procedures which are the subject of the determination. In this case, the PHA is not required to provide the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA's administrative grievance procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) The PHA grievance procedure shall not be applicable to disputes between tenants not involving the PHA or to class grievances. The grievance procedure is not intended as a forum for initiating or negotiating policy changes between a group or groups of tenants and the PHA's Board of Commissioners.</P>

              <P>(c) The PHA shall provide at least 30 days notice to tenants and resident organizations setting forth proposed changes in the PHA grievance procedure, and providing an opportunity to present written comments. Subject to requirements of this subpart, comments submitted shall be considered by the PHA before adoption of any grievance procedure changes by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(d) The PHA shall furnish a copy of the grievance procedure to each tenant and to resident organizations.</P>
              <P>(e) The PHA must not only meet the minimal procedural due process requirements contained in this subpart but also satisfy any additional requirements required by local, state, or federal law.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Procedures governing the hearing.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The hearing must be scheduled promptly for a time and place reasonably convenient to both the complainant and the PHA and held before a hearing officer. A written notification specifying the time, place, and the procedures governing the hearing must be delivered to the complainant and the appropriate official.</P>
              <P>(b) The complainant shall be afforded a fair hearing, which shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The opportunity to examine before the grievance hearing any PHA documents, including records and regulations, that are directly relevant to the hearing. (For a grievance hearing concerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, see also § 966.4(m).) The tenant shall be allowed to copy any such document at the tenant's expense. If the PHA does not make the document available for examination upon request by the complainant, the PHA may not rely on such document at the grievance hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) The right to be represented by counsel or other person chosen as the tenant's representative and to have such person make statements on the tenant's behalf;</P>
              <P>(3) The right to a private hearing unless the complainant requests a public hearing;</P>
              <P>(4) The right to present evidence and arguments in support of the tenant's complaint, to controvert evidence relied on by the PHA or project management, and to confront and cross-examine all witnesses upon whose testimony or information the PHA or project management relies; and</P>
              <P>(5) A decision based solely and exclusively upon the facts presented at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(c) If the complainant or the PHA fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, the hearing officer may make a determination to postpone the hearing for no more than 5 business days or may make a determination that the party has waived his right to a hearing. Both the complainant and the PHA must be notified of the determination by the hearing officer. A determination that the complainant has waived the complainant's right to a hearing will not constitute a waiver of any right the complainant may have to contest the PHA's disposition of the grievance in an appropriate judicial proceeding.</P>
              <P>(d) At the hearing, the complainant must first make a showing of an entitlement to the relief sought and thereafter the PHA must sustain the burden of justifying the PHA action or failure to act against which the complaint is directed.</P>
              <P>(e) The complainant or the PHA may arrange, in advance and at the expense of the party making the arrangement, for a transcript of the hearing. Any interested party may purchase a copy of such transcript.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Accommodation of persons with disabilities.</E> (1) The PHA must provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities to participate in the hearing. Reasonable accommodation may include qualified sign language interpreters, readers, accessible locations, or attendants.</P>
              <P>(2) If the tenant is visually impaired, any notice to the tenant which is required under this subpart must be in an accessible format.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Limited English Proficiency.</E> PHAs must comply with HUD's “Final Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English Proficient Persons” issued on January 22, 2007 and available at <E T="03">http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/promotingfh/lep-faq.</E>

              <P>(a) The hearing officer must prepare a written decision, including the reasons for the PHA's decision within a reasonable time after the hearing. A copy of the decision must be sent to the complainant and the PHA. The <PRTPAGE P="464"/>PHA must retain a copy of the decision in the tenant's folder. The PHA must maintain a log of all hearing officer decisions and make that log available upon request of the hearing officer, a prospective complainant, or a prospective complainant's representative.</P>
              <P>(b) The decision of the hearing officer will be binding on the PHA unless the PHA Board of Commissioners determines that:</P>
              <P>(1) The grievance does not concern PHA action or failure to act in accordance with or involving the complainant's lease on PHA regulations, which adversely affects the complainant's rights, duties, welfare or status; or</P>
              <P>(2) The decision of the hearing officer is contrary to applicable Federal, State or local law, HUD regulations or requirements of the annual contributions contract between HUD and the PHA.</P>
              <P>(c) A decision by the hearing officer or Board of Commissioners in favor of the PHA or which denies the relief requested by the complainant in whole or in part will not constitute a waiver of, nor affect in any manner whatever, any rights the complainant may have to a trial de novo or judicial review in any judicial proceedings, which may thereafter be brought in the matter.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General requirements for HUD approval of a PHA demolition/disposition application.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Application for HUD Approval.</E> A PHA must obtain written approval from HUD before undertaking any transaction involving demolition or disposition of PHA-owned property under the ACC. Where a PHA demolishes or disposes of public housing property without HUD approval, no HUD funds may be used to fund the costs of demolition or disposition or reimburse the PHA for those costs. HUD will approve an application for demolition or disposition upon the PHA's submission of an application with the required certifications and the supporting information required by this section and §§ 970.15 or 970.17. Section 970.29 specifies criteria for disapproval of an application. Approval of the application under this part does not imply approval of a request for additional funding, which the PHA must make separately under a program that makes available funding for this purpose. The PHA shall submit the application for demolition or disposition and the timetable in a time and manner and in a form prescribed by HUD. The supporting information shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A certification that the PHA has described the demolition or disposition in the PHA Annual Plan and timetable under 24 CFR part 903 (except in the case of small or high-performing PHAs eligible for streamlined annual plan treatment), and that the description in the PHA Annual Plan is identical to the application submitted pursuant to this part and otherwise complies with section 18 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p) and this part;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of all identifiable property, by development, including land, dwelling units, and other improvements, involved in the proposed demolition or disposition;</P>
            <P>(3) A description of the specific action proposed, such as:</P>
            <P>(i) Demolition, disposition, or demolition with disposition;</P>
            <P>(ii) If disposition is involved, the method of sale;</P>
            <P>(4) A general timetable for the proposed action(s), including the initial contract for demolition, the actual demolition, and, if applicable, the closing of sale or other form of disposition;</P>
            <P>(5) A statement justifying the proposed demolition or disposition under the applicable criteria of §§ 970.15 or 970.17;</P>
            <P>(6) If applicable, a plan for the relocation of tenants who would be displaced by the proposed demolition or disposition (including persons with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodations and a relocation timetable as prescribed in § 970.21);</P>

            <P>(7) A description with supporting evidence of the PHA's consultations with <PRTPAGE P="467"/>residents, any resident organizations, and the Resident Advisory Board, as required under § 903.9 of this title;</P>
            <P>(8) In the case of disposition only, evidence of compliance with the offering to resident organizations, as required under § 970.9;</P>
            <P>(9) In the case of disposition, an estimate of the fair market value of the property, established on the basis of one independent appraisal, unless otherwise determined by HUD, as described in § 970.19(c);</P>
            <P>(10) In the case of disposition, estimates of the gross and net proceeds to be realized, with an itemization of estimated costs to be paid out of gross proceeds and the proposed use of any net proceeds in accordance with § 970.19;</P>
            <P>(11) An estimate of costs for any required relocation housing, moving costs, and counseling.</P>
            <P>(12) Where the PHA is requesting a waiver of the requirement for the application of proceeds for repayment of outstanding debt, the PHA must request such a waiver in its application, along with a description of the proposed use of the proceeds;</P>
            <P>(13) A copy of a resolution by the PHA's Board of Commissioners approving the specific demolition or disposition application (or, in the case of the report required under § 970.27(e) for “de minimis” demolitions, the Board of Commissioner's resolution approving the “de minimis” action) for that development or developments or portions thereof. The resolution must be signed and dated after all resident and local government consultation has been completed;</P>
            <P>(14) Evidence that the application was developed in consultation with appropriate government officials as defined in § 970.5, including:</P>
            <P>(i) A description of the process of consultation with local government officials, which summarizes dates, meetings, and issues raised by the local government officials and the PHA's responses to those issues;</P>
            <P>(ii) A signed and dated letter in support of the application from the chief executive officer of the unit of local government that demonstrates that the PHA has consulted with the appropriate local government officials on the proposed demolition or disposition;</P>
            <P>(iii) Where the local government consistently fails to respond to the PHA's attempts at consultation, including letters, requests for meetings, public notices, and other reasonable efforts, documentation of those attempts;</P>
            <P>(iv) Where the PHA covers multiple jurisdictions (such as a regional housing authority), the PHA must meet these requirements for each of the jurisdictions where the PHA is proposing demolition or disposition of PHA property;</P>
            <P>(15) An approved environmental review of the proposed demolition or disposition in accordance with 24 CFR parts 50 or 58 for any demolition or disposition of public housing property covered under this part, as required under 24 CFR 970.13;</P>
            <P>(16) A certification that the demolition or disposition application does not violate any remedial civil rights order or agreement, voluntary compliance agreement, final judgment, consent decree, settlement agreement, or other court order or agreement;</P>
            <P>(17) Any additional information necessary to support the application and assist HUD in making determinations under this part.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Completion of demolition/disposition or rescissions of approval.</E> (1) HUD will consider a PHA's request to rescind an earlier approval to demolish or dispose of public housing property, where a PHA submits a resolution from the Board of Commissioners and submits documentation that the conditions that originally led to the request for demolition or disposition have significantly changed or been removed.</P>
            <P>(2) The Assistant Secretary will not approve any request by the PHA to either substitute units or add units to those originally included in the approved demolition or disposition application, unless the PHA submits a new application for those units that meet the requirements of this part.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Resident consultation.</E> PHAs must consult with residents who will be affected by the proposed action with respect to all demolition or disposition applications. The PHA must provide <PRTPAGE P="468"/>with its application evidence that the application was developed in consultation with residents who will be affected by the proposed action, any resident organizations for the development, PHA-wide resident organizations that will be affected by the demolition or disposition, and the Resident Advisory Board (RAB). The PHA must also submit copies of any written comments submitted to the PHA and any evaluation that the PHA has made of the comments.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Resident organization offer to sell—applicability.</E> In the situation where the PHA applies to dispose of a development or portion of a development:</P>
            <P>(1) The PHA shall, in appropriate circumstances as determined by the Assistant Secretary, initially offer the property proposed for disposition to any eligible resident organization, eligible resident management corporation as defined in 24 CFR part 964, or to a nonprofit organization acting on behalf of the residents at any development proposed for disposition, if the resident entity has expressed an interest in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing. The entity must make the request in writing to the PHA, no later than 30 days after the resident entity has received the notification of sale from the PHA;</P>
            <P>(2) If the resident entity has expressed an interest in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing, the entity, in order for its purchase offer to be considered, must:</P>
            <P>(i) In the case of a nonprofit organization, be acting on behalf of the residents of the development; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Demonstrate that it has obtained a firm commitment for the necessary financing within 60 days of serving its written notice of interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The requirements of this section do not apply to the following cases, which have been determined not to present an appropriate opportunity for purchase by a resident organization:</P>
            <P>(i) A unit of state or local government requests to acquire vacant land that is less than two acres in order to build or expand its public services (a local government wishes to use the land to build or establish a police substation); or</P>
            <P>(ii) A PHA seeks disposition outside the public housing program to privately finance or otherwise develop a facility to benefit low-income families (e.g., day care center, administrative building, mixed-finance housing under 24 CFR part 941 subpart F, or other types of low-income housing);</P>
            <P>(iii) Units that have been legally vacated in accordance with the HOPE VI program, the regulations at 24 CFR part 971, or the mandatory conversion regulations at 24 CFR part 972, excluding developments where the PHA has consolidated vacancies;</P>
            <P>(iv) Distressed units required to be converted to tenant-based assistance under section 33 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5); or</P>
            <P>(v) Disposition of non-dwelling properties, including administration and community buildings, and maintenance facilities.</P>
            <P>(4) If the requirements of this section are not applicable, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the PHA may proceed to submit to HUD its application under this part to dispose of the property, or a portion of the property, without affording an opportunity for purchase by a resident organization. However, PHAs must consult with their residents in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The PHA must submit documentation with date and signatures to support the applicability of one of the exceptions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Examples of appropriate documentation include, but are not limited to: a letter from the public body that wants to acquire the land, copies of memoranda or letters approving the PHA's previous application under part 970 or mandatory conversion plan, and the HUD transmittal document approving the proposed revitalization plan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Established eligible organizations.</E> Where there are eligible resident organizations, eligible resident management corporations as defined in 24 CFR part 964, or nonprofit organizations acting on behalf of the residents as defined in 24 CFR part 964 (collectively, “established eligible organizations”), that have expressed an interest, in writing, to the PHA within 30 days of <PRTPAGE P="469"/>the date of notification of the proposed sale, in purchasing the property for continued use as low-income housing at the affected development, the PHA shall follow the procedures for making the offer described in § 970.11.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for the offer of sale to established eligible organizations.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In making an offer of sale to established eligible organizations as defined in § 970.9(c) in the case of proposed disposition, the PHA shall proceed as follows:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Initial written notification of sale of property.</E> The PHA shall send an initial written notification to each established eligible organization (for purposes of this section, an established eligible organization that has been so notified is a “notified eligible organization”) of the proposed sale of the property. The notice of sale must include, at a minimum, the information listed in paragraph (d) of this section;</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial expression of interest.</E> All notified eligible organizations shall have 30 days to initially express an interest, in writing, in the offer (“initial expression of interest”). The initial expression of interest need not contain details regarding financing, acceptance of an offer of sale, or any other terms of sale.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Opportunity to obtain firm financial commitment by interested entity.</E> If a notified eligible organization expresses interest in writing during the 30-day period referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, no disposition of the property shall occur during the 60-day period beginning on the date of the receipt of the written notice of interest. During this period, the PHA must give the entity expressing interest an opportunity to obtain a firm financial commitment as defined in § 970.5 for the financing necessary to purchase the property;</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Contents of initial written notification.</E> The initial written notification to established eligible organizations under paragraph (a) of this section must include at a minimum the following:</P>
            <P>(1) An identification of the development, or portion of the development, involved in the proposed disposition, including the development number and location, the number of units and bedroom configuration, the amount and use of non-dwelling space, the current physical condition (fire damaged, friable asbestos, lead-based paint test results), and percent of occupancy;</P>
            <P>(2) A copy of the appraisal of the property and any terms of sale;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure and description of the PHA's plans for reuse of land, if any, after the proposed disposition;</P>
            <P>(4) An identification of available resources (including its own and HUD's) to provide technical assistance to the organization to help it to better understand its opportunity to purchase the development, the development's value, and potential use;</P>
            <P>(5) A statement that public housing developments sold to resident organizations will not continue to receive capital and operating subsidy after the completion of the sale;</P>
            <P>(6) Any and all terms of sale that the PHA will require, including a statement that the purchaser must use the property for low-income housing. If the PHA does not know all the terms of the offer of sale at the time of the notice of sale, the PHA shall include all the terms of sale of which it is aware. The PHA must supply the totality of all the terms of sale and all necessary material to the residents no later than 3 business days from the day it receives the residents' initial expression of interest;</P>
            <P>(7) A date by which an established eligible organization must express its interest, in writing, in response to the PHA's offer to sell the property proposed for demolition or disposition, which shall be up to 30 days from the date of the official written offer of sale from the PHA;</P>

            <P>(8) A statement that the established eligible organization will be given 60 days from the date of the PHA's receipt of its letter expressing interest to develop and submit a proposal to the PHA to purchase the property and to obtain a firm financial commitment, as defined in § 970.5. The statement shall explain that the PHA shall approve the proposal from an organization if the <PRTPAGE P="470"/>proposal meets the terms of sale and is supported by a firm commitment for financing. The statement shall also provide that the PHA can consider accepting an offer from the organization that differs from the terms of sale. The statement shall explain that if the PHA receives proposals from more than one organization, the PHA shall select the proposal that meets the terms of sale, if any. In the event that two proposals from the development to be sold meet the terms of sale, the PHA shall choose the best proposal. If no proposal meets the terms of sale, the PHA in its discretion may or may not select the best proposal.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Response to the notice of sale.</E> The established eligible organization or organizations have up to 30 days to respond to the notice of sale from the PHA. The established eligible organization shall respond to the PHA's notice of sale by means of an initial expression of interest under paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Resident proposal.</E> The established eligible organization has up to 60 days from the date the PHA receives its initial expression of interest and provides all necessary terms and information to prepare and submit a proposal to the PHA for the purchase of the property of which the PHA plans to dispose, and to obtain a firm commitment for financing. The resident's proposal shall provide all the information requested in paragraph (i) of this section.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">PHA Review of Proposals.</E> The PHA has up to 60 days from the date of receipt of the proposal or proposals to review the proposals and determine whether they meet the terms of sale described in the PHA's offer or offers. If the PHA determines that the proposal meets the terms of sale, within 14 days of the date of this determination, the PHA shall notify the organization of that fact and that the proposal has been accepted. If the PHA determines that the proposal differs from the terms of sale, the PHA may accept or reject the proposal at its discretion;</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> The established eligible organization has the right to appeal the PHA's decision to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or his designee, by sending a letter of appeal within 30 days of the date of the PHA's decision to the field office director. The letter of appeal must include copies of the proposal and any related correspondence, along with a statement of reasons why the organization believes the PHA should have decided differently. HUD shall render a decision within 30 days, and notify the organization and the PHA by letter within 14 days of such decision. If HUD cannot render a decision within 30 days, HUD will so notify the PHA and the established eligible organization in writing, in which case HUD will have an additional 30 days in which to render a decision. HUD may continue to extend its time for decision in 30-day increments for a total of 120 days. Once HUD renders its decision, there is no further administrative appeal or remedy available.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Contents of the organization's proposal.</E> The established eligible organization's proposal shall at a minimum include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The length of time the organization has been in existence;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of current or past activities that demonstrate the organization's organizational and management capability, or the planned acquisition of such capability through a partner or other outside entities (in which case the proposal should state how the partner or outside entity meets this requirement);</P>
            <P>(3) To the extent not included in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the organization's experience in the development of low-income housing, or planned arrangements with partners or outside entities with such experience (in which case the proposal should state how the partner or outside entity meets this requirement);</P>
            <P>(4) A statement of financial capability;</P>
            <P>(5) A description of involvement of any non-resident organization (such as non-profit, for-profit, governmental, or other entities), if any, the proposed division of responsibilities between the non-resident organization and the established eligible organization, and the non-resident organization's financial capabilities;</P>

            <P>(6) A plan for financing the purchase of the property and a firm financial commitment as stated in paragraph (c) <PRTPAGE P="471"/>of this section for funding resources necessary to purchase the property and pay for any necessary repairs;</P>
            <P>(7) A plan for using the property for low-income housing;</P>
            <P>(8) The proposed purchase price in relation to the appraised value;</P>
            <P>(9) Justification for purchase at less than the fair market value in accordance with § 970.19(a) of this part, if appropriate;</P>
            <P>(10) Estimated time schedule for completing the transaction;</P>
            <P>(11) Any additional items necessary to respond fully to the PHA's terms of sale;</P>
            <P>(12) A resolution from the resident organization approving the proposal; and</P>
            <P>(13) A proposed date of settlement, generally not to exceed 6 months from the date of PHA approval of the proposal, or such period as the PHA may determine to be reasonable.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">PHA obligations.</E> The PHA must:</P>
            <P>(1) Prepare and distribute the initial notice of sale pursuant to 24 CFR 970.11(a), and, if any established eligible organization expresses an interest, any further documents necessary to enable the organization or organizations to make an offer to purchase;</P>
            <P>(2) Evaluate proposals received, make the selection based on the considerations set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and issue letters of acceptance or rejection;</P>
            <P>(3) Prepare certifications, where appropriate, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section;</P>
            <P>(4) Comply with its obligations under § 970.7(a) regarding tenant consultation and provide evidence to HUD that the PHA has met those obligations. The PHA shall not act in an arbitrary manner and shall give full and fair consideration to any offer from a qualified resident management corporation, resident council of the affected development, or a nonprofit organization acting on behalf of the residents, and shall accept the proposal if the proposal meets the terms of sale.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">PHA post-offer requirements.</E> After the resident offer, if any, is made, the PHA shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Submit its disposition application to HUD in accordance with section 18 of the Act and this part. The disposition application must include complete documentation that the resident offer provisions of this part have been met. This documentation shall include:</P>
            <P>(i) A copy of the signed and dated PHA notification letter(s) to each established eligible organization informing them of the PHA's intention to submit an application for disposition, the organization's right to purchase the property to be disposed of; and</P>
            <P>(ii) The responses from each organization.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If the PHA accepts the proposal of an established eligible organization, the PHA shall submit revisions to its disposition application to HUD in accordance with section 18 of the Act and this part reflecting the arrangement with the resident organization, with appropriate justification for a negotiated sale and for sale at less than fair market value, if applicable.</P>
            <P>(ii) If the PHA rejects the proposal of the resident organization, the resident organization may appeal as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Once the appeal is resolved, or, if there is no appeal, and the 30 days allowed for appeal has passed, HUD shall proceed to approve or disapprove the application.</P>
            <P>(3) HUD will not process an application for disposition unless the PHA provides HUD with one of the following:</P>
            <P>(i) An official board resolution or its equivalent from each established eligible organization stating that such organization has received the PHA offer, and that it understands the offer and waives its opportunity to purchase the project, or portion of the project, covered by the disposition application;</P>
            <P>(ii) A certification from the executive director or board of commissioners of the PHA that the 30-day time frame to express interest has expired and no response was received to its offer; or</P>

            <SUBJECT>Environmental review requirements.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Activities under this part (including de minimis demolition pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="472"/>§ 970.27) are subject to HUD environmental regulations in 24 CFR part 58. However, HUD may make a finding in accordance with 24 CFR 58.11(d) of this title and may itself perform the environmental review under the provisions of 24 CFR part 50 if a PHA objects in writing to the responsible entity performing the review under 24 CFR part 58.</P>
            <P>(b) The environmental review is limited to the demolition or disposition action and any known re-use, and is not required for any unknown future re-use. Factors that indicate that the future site reuse can reasonably be considered to be known include the following:</P>
            <P>(1) Private, Federal, state, or local funding for the site reuse has been committed;</P>
            <P>(2) A grant application involving the site has been filed with the Federal government or a state or local unit of government;</P>
            <P>(3) The Federal government or a state or unit of local government has made a commitment to take an action, including a physical action, that will facilitate a particular reuse of the site; and</P>
            <P>(4) Architectural, engineering, or design plans for the reuse exist that go beyond preliminary stages.</P>

            <P>(c) In the case of a demolition or disposition made necessary by a disaster that the President has declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> or a disaster that has been declared under state law by the officer or entity with legal authority to make such declaration, pursuant to 24 CFR 50.43 and 24 CFR 58.33, the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.11 will apply.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Specific criteria for HUD approval of demolition requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) In addition to other applicable requirements of this part, HUD will approve an application for demolition upon the PHA's certification that it meets the following statutory criteria, unless the application meets the criteria for disapproval under 24 CFR 970.29. An application for the demolition of all or a portion of a public housing project must certify that the project:</P>
            <P>(1) Is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unsuitable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of modifications is cost-effective to return the public housing project or portion of the project to useful life; and</P>
            <P>(2) In the case of an application for demolition of a portion of a project, the demolition will help to ensure the viability of the remaining portion of the project.</P>
            <P>(b) As to paragraph (a)(1) of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Major problems indicative of obsolescence are:</P>
            <P>(i) As to physical condition: Structural deficiencies that cannot be corrected in a cost-effective manner (settlement of earth below the building caused by inadequate structural fills, faulty structural design, or settlement of floors), or other design or site problems (severe erosion or flooding);</P>
            <P>(ii) As to location: physical deterioration of the neighborhood; change from residential to industrial or commercial development; or environmental conditions as determined by HUD environmental review in accord with 24 CFR part 50, which jeopardize the suitability of the site or a portion of the site and its housing structures for residential use; or</P>
            <P>(iii) There are other factors that have seriously affected the marketability, usefulness, or management of the property.</P>
            <P>(2) HUD generally shall not consider a program of modifications to be cost-effective if the costs of such program exceed 62.5 percent of total development cost (TDC) for elevator structures and 57.14 percent of TDC for all other types of structures in effect at the time the application is submitted to HUD.</P>

            <P>(c) As to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a partial demolition will be considered to ensure the viability of the remaining portion if the application certifies that the demolition will reduce development density to permit better access by emergency, fire, or rescue services, or improve marketability by reducing the density to that <PRTPAGE P="473"/>of the neighborhood or other developments in the PHA's inventory.</P>

            <P>In addition to other applicable requirements of this part, HUD will approve a request for disposition by sale or other transfer of a public housing project or other real property if the PHA certifies that the retention of the property is not in the best interests of the residents or the PHA for at least one of the following reasons, unless information available to HUD is inconsistent with the certification:</P>
            <P>(a) Conditions in the area surrounding the project (density, or industrial or commercial development) adversely affect the health or safety of the tenants or the feasible operation of the project by the PHA;</P>
            <P>(b) Disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties that will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing developments;</P>
            <P>(c) The PHA has otherwise determined the disposition to be appropriate for reasons that are consistent with the goals of the PHA and the PHA Plan and that are otherwise consistent with the Act;</P>
            <P>(d) In the case of disposition of property other than dwelling units (community facilities or vacant land), the PHA certifies that:</P>
            <P>(1) The non-dwelling facilities or land exceeds the needs of the development (after DOFA); or</P>
            <P>(2) The disposition of the property is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of the remaining portion of the development.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Disposition of property; use of proceeds.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Where HUD approves the disposition of real property of a development, in whole or in part, the PHA shall dispose of the property promptly for not less than fair market value (in which case there is no showing of commensurate public benefit required), unless HUD authorizes negotiated sale for reasons found to be in the best interests of the PHA or the federal government; or dispose of the property for sale for less than fair market value (where permitted by state law), based on commensurate public benefits to the community, the PHA, or the federal government justifying such an exception. General public improvements, such as streets and bridges, do not qualify as commensurate public benefits.</P>
            <P>(b) A PHA may pay the reasonable costs of disposition, and of relocation of displaced tenants allowable under § 970.21, out of the gross proceeds, as approved by HUD.</P>
            <P>(c) To obtain an estimate of the fair market value before the property is advertised for bid, the PHA shall have one independent appraisal performed on the property proposed for disposition, unless HUD determines that:</P>
            <P>(1) More than one appraisal is warranted; or</P>
            <P>(2) Another method of valuation is clearly sufficient and the expense of an independent appraisal is unjustified because of the limited nature of the property interest involved or other available data.</P>
            <P>(d) To obtain an estimate of the fair market value when a property is not publicly advertised for bid, HUD may accept a reasonable valuation of the property.</P>
            <P>(e) A PHA shall use net proceeds, including any interest earned on the proceeds (after payment of HUD-approved costs of disposition and relocation under paragraph (a) of this section), subject to HUD approval, as follows:</P>
            <P>(1) Unless waived by HUD, for the retirement of outstanding obligations, if any, issued to finance original development or modernization of the project; and</P>
            <P>(2) To the extent that any net proceeds remain, after the application of proceeds in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for:</P>
            <P>(i) The provision of low-income housing or to benefit the residents of the PHA, through such measures as modernization of lower-income housing or the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties to operate as lower-income housing; or</P>

            <P>(ii) Leveraging amounts for securing commercial enterprises, on-site in public housing developments of the PHA, <PRTPAGE P="474"/>appropriate to serve the needs of the residents.</P>
            <P>(f) For dispositions for the purpose stated in § 970.17(b), a PHA must demonstrate to the satisfaction of HUD that the replacement units are being provided in connection with the disposition of the property. A PHA may use sale proceeds in accordance with paragraph (e) to fund the replacement units.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Relocation of residents.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Relocation of residents on a nondiscriminatory basis and relocation resources.</E> A PHA must offer each family displaced by demolition or disposition comparable housing that meets housing quality standards (HQS) and is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced persons. The housing must be offered on a nondiscriminatory basis, without regard to race, color, religion, creed, national origin, handicap, age, familial status, or gender, in compliance with applicable Federal and state laws. For persons with disabilities displaced from a unit with reasonable accommodations, comparable housing should include similar accommodations. Such housing may include:</P>
            <P>(1) Tenant-based assistance, such as assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, 24 CFR part 982, except that such assistance will not be considered “comparable housing” until the family is actually relocated into such housing;</P>
            <P>(2) Project-based assistance; or</P>
            <P>(3) Occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA at a rental rate paid by the family that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the family is vacated.</P>

            <P>Where HUD has approved demolition of a project, or a portion of a project, and the proposed action is part of a program under the Capital Fund Program (24 CFR part 905), the costs of demolition and of relocation of displaced residents may be included in the budget funded with capital funds pursuant to section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) or awarded HOPE VI or other eligible HUD funds.</P>

            <P>(a) A PHA may not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing development or a portion of a public housing development without obtaining HUD approval under this part. HUD funds may not be used to pay for the cost to demolish or dispose of a public housing development or a portion of a public housing development, unless HUD approval has been obtained under this part. Until the PHA receives HUD approval, the PHA shall continue to meet its ACC obligations to maintain and operate the property as housing for low-income families. However, the PHA may engage in planning activities, analysis, or consultations without seeking HUD approval. Planning activities may include project viability studies, capital planning, or comprehensive occupancy planning. The PHA must continue to provide full housing services to all residents that remain in the development. A PHA should not re-rent these units at turnover while HUD is considering its application for demolition or disposition. However, the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility will continue to be calculated as stated in 24 CFR part 990.</P>
            <P>(b) A PHA may consolidate occupancy within or among buildings of a development, or among developments, or with other housing for the purposes of improving living conditions of, or providing more efficient services to residents, without submitting a demolition or disposition application.</P>

            <SUBJECT>De minimis exception to demolition requirements.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A PHA may demolish units without submitting an application if the PHA is proposing to demolish not more than the lesser of:</P>
            <P>(1) five dwelling units; or</P>
            <P>(2) 5 percent of the total dwelling units owned by the PHA over any 5-year period.</P>

            <P>(b) The 5-year period referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is the 5 years counting backward from the date of the proposed de minimis demolition, except that any demolition performed prior to October 21, 1998, will not be counted against the five units or 5 percent of the total, as applicable. For example, if a PHA that owns 1,000 housing units wishes to demolish units under this de minimis provision on July 1, 2004, and previously demolished two units under this provision on September 1, 2000, and two more units on July 1, 2001, the PHA would be able to demolish one additional unit for a total of five in the preceding 5 years. As another example, if a PHA that owns 60 housing units as of July 1, 2004, had demolished two units on September 1, 2000, and one unit on July 1, 2001, that <PRTPAGE P="476"/>PHA would not be able to demolish any further units under this “de minimis” provision until after September 1, 2005, because it would have already demolished 5 percent of its total.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) In order to qualify for this exemption, the space occupied by the demolished unit must be used for meeting the service or other needs of public housing residents (use of space to construct a laundry facility, community center, child care facility, office space for a general provider; or for use as open space or garden); or</P>
            <P>(2) The unit being demolished must be beyond repair.</P>
            <P>(d) PHAs utilizing this section will comply with environmental review requirements at 24 CFR 970.13 and, if applicable, the requirements of 24 CFR 8.23.</P>
            <P>(e) For recordkeeping purposes, PHAs that wish to demolish units under this section shall submit the information required in § 970.7(a)(1), (2), (12), (13), and (14). HUD will accept a certification from the PHA that one of the two conditions in paragraph (c) of this section apply unless HUD has independent information that requirements for “de minimis” demolition have not been met.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Section 202 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub.L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) (“OCRA”) requires PHAs to identify certain distressed public housing developments that cost more than Section 8 rental assistance and cannot be reasonably revitalized. Households in occupancy that will be affected by the activities will be offered tenant-based or project-based assistance (that can include other public housing units) and will be relocated, to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice. After residents are relocated, the distressed developments (or affected buildings) for which no reasonable means of revitalization exists will be removed from the public housing inventory.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards for identifying developments.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) PHAs shall use the following standards for identifying developments or portions thereof which are subject to section 202's requirement that PHAs develop and carry out plans for the removal over time from the public housing inventory. These standards track section 202(a) of OCRA. The development, or portions thereof, must:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Be on the same or contiguous sites.</E> (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(1)). This standard and the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section refer to the actual number and location of units, irrespective of HUD development project numbers.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Total more than 300 dwelling units.</E> (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(2)).</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Have a vacancy rate of at least ten percent for dwelling units not in funded, on-schedule modernization.</E> (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(3)). For this determination, PHAs and HUD shall use the data the PHA relied upon for its last Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (Report on Occupancy), or more recent data which demonstrates improvement in occupancy rates. Units in the following categories shall not be included in this calculation:</P>
            <P>(i) Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;</P>
            <P>(ii) Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but only if State law requires the property to be left in the unit for some period of time, and only for the period stated in the law;</P>
            <P>(iii) Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only until the insurance claim is adjusted; and</P>
            <P>(iv) Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that are utilized for resident services.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Have an estimated cost of continued operation and modernization of the developments as public housing in excess of the cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for all families in occupancy, based on appropriate indicators of cost (such as the percentage of total development cost required for modernization).</E> (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(5)).</P>
            <P>(i) For purposes of this determination, the costs used for public housing shall be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as described in the paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</P>

            <P>(ii) These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization costs <PRTPAGE P="478"/>and accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost of continuing the development as public housing.</P>
            <P>(iii) That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost.</P>
            <P>(iv) Both the method to be used and an example are included in the Appendix to this part.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Be identified as distressed housing that the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing through reasonable revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of a broader range of household income.</E> (OCRA Sec. 202(a)(4)). [See § 971.5.]</P>
            <P>(b) Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section will be assumed to be “distressed” unless the PHA can show that the property fails the standard set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for reasons that are temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.</P>
            <P>(c) Where the PHA will demolish all of the units in a development, or the portion thereof, that is subject to section 202, section 202 requirements will be satisfied once the demolition occurs and its standards will not be applied further to the use of the site.</P>
            <P>(d) PHAs will meet the test for assuring long-term viability of identified housing only if it is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least twenty years (or at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy; will not be excessively densely configured relative to standards for similar (typically family) housing in the community; will not constitute an excessive concentration of very low-income families; and has no other site impairments which clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 971.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Long-term viability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Reasonable investment.</E> (1) Proposed revitalization costs for viability must be reasonable. Such costs must not exceed, and ordinarily would be substantially less than, 90 percent of HUD's total development cost limit for the units proposed to be revitalized (100 percent of the total development cost limit for any “infill” new construction subject to this regulation). The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent comprehensive plan for modernization is to be used for this purpose, unless a PHA demonstrates or HUD determines that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(2) The overall projected cost of the revitalized development must not exceed the Section 8 cost under the method contained in the Appendix to this part, even if the cost of revitalization is a lower percentage of the TDC than the limits stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) The source of funding for such a revitalization program must be identified and already available. In addition to other resources already available to the PHA, a PHA may assume that future formula funds provided through the Comprehensive Grant Program are available for this purpose, provided that they are sufficient to permit completion of the revitalization within the statutory five year time frame. (Comprehensive plans must be amended accordingly.)</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Density.</E> Density reduction measures would have to result in a public housing community with a density approaching that which prevails in the community for similar types of housing (typically family), or a lower density. If the development's density already meets this description, further reduction in density is not a requirement.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Income mix.</E> (1) Measures generally will be required to broaden the range of resident incomes to include over time a significant mix of households with at least one full-time worker (for example, at least 20 percent with an income at least 30 percent of median area income). Measures to achieve a broader range of household incomes must be realistic in view of the site's location. Evidence of such realism typically would include some mix of incomes of other households located in the same census tract or neighborhood, or unique advantages of the public housing site.<PRTPAGE P="479"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) For purposes of judging appropriateness of density reduction and broader range of income measures, overall size of the public housing site and its number of dwelling units will be considered. The concerns these measures would address generally are greater as the site's size and number of dwelling units increase.</P>

            <P>(b) <E T="03">Plan for removal.</E> With respect to any development that meets all of the standards listed, the PHA shall develop a plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory. The plan should consider relocation alternatives for households in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance, and shall provide for relocation from the units as soon as possible. For planning purposes, PHAs shall assume that HUD will be able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental assistance. The plan shall include:</P>
            <P>(1) A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the inventory;</P>
            <P>(2) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size;</P>
            <P>(3) Identification and obligation status of any previously approved CIAP, modernization, or major reconstruction funds for the distressed development and PHA recommendations concerning transfer of these funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;</P>
            <P>(4) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing;</P>
            <P>(5) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory;</P>
            <P>(6) Provision for notifying families residing in the development, in a timely fashion, that the development shall be removed from the public housing inventory; informing such families that they will receive tenant-based or project-based assistance; providing any necessary counselling with respect to the relocation, including a request for any necessary counseling funds; and assuring that such families are relocated as necessary to other decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;</P>
            <P>(7) The displacement and relocation provisions set forth in 24 CFR 970.5.</P>
            <P>(8) A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected development and the unit of local government where the public housing is located, as set forth in § 971.9.</P>
            <P>(c) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 shall not apply to demolition of developments removed from PHA inventories under this section, but shall apply to any proposed dispositions of such developments or their sites. HUD's review of any such disposition application will take into account that the development has been required to be removed from the PHA's inventory.</P>
            <P>(d) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility under the Performance Funding System (PFS), the submitted plan will be considered the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and ACC and approval (or acceptance). The PHA will receive written notification that the plan has been approved (or accepted). Units that are vacant or vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of this chapter and also will be provided the phase-down of subsidy pursuant to § 990.114 of this chapter.</P>

            <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 971—Methodology of Comparing Cost of Public Housing With Cost of Tenant-Based Assistance</HD>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Public Housing</HD>
            <P>The costs used for public housing shall be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as described in the next paragraph. These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization costs and costs to address accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost of continuing the development as public housing. That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost. The estimated cost of the continued operation and modernization as public housing shall be calculated as the sum of total operating, modernization, and accrual costs, expressed on a monthly per occupied unit basis. The costs shall be expressed in current dollar terms for the period for which the most recent Section 8 costs are available.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">A. Operating Costs</HD>

            <P>1. The proposed revitalization plan must indicate how unusually high current operating expenses (e.g, security, supportive services, maintenance, utilities) will be reduced as a result of post-revitalization changes in occupancy, density and building configuration, income mix and management. The plan must make a realistic projection of overall operating costs per occupied unit in the revitalized development, by relating those operating costs to the expected occupancy rate, tenant composition, physical configuration and management structure of the revitalized development. The projected costs should also address the comparable costs of buildings or developments whose <PRTPAGE P="481"/>siting, configuration, and tenant mix is similar to that of the revitalized public housing development.</P>
            <P>2. The development's operating cost (including all overhead costs pro-rated to the development—including a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) or some other comparable payment, and including utilities and utility allowances) shall be expressed as total operating costs per month, divided by the number of units occupied by households. For example, if a development will have 1,000 units occupied by households and will have $300,000 monthly in non-utility costs (including pro-rated overhead costs and appropriate P.I.L.O.T.) and $100,000 monthly in utility costs paid by the authority and $50,000 monthly in utility allowances that are deducted from tenant rental payments to the authority because tenants paid some utility bills directly to the utility company, then the development's monthly operating cost per occupied unit is $450—the sum of $300 per unit in non-utility costs, $100 per unit in direct utility costs, and $50 per unit in utility allowance costs.</P>
            <P>3. In justifying the operating cost estimates as realistic, the plan should link the cost estimates to its assumptions about the level and rate of occupancy, the per-unit funding of modernization, any physical reconfiguration that will result from modernization, any planned changes in the surrounding neighborhood and security costs. The plan should also show whether developments or buildings in viable condition in similar neighborhoods have achieved the income mix and occupancy rate projected for the revitalized development. The plan should also show how the operating costs of the similar developments or buildings compare to the operating costs projected for the development.</P>
            <P>4. In addition to presenting evidence that the operating costs of the revitalized development are plausible, when the per-unit operating cost of the renovated development is more than ten percent lower than the current per-unit operating cost of the development, then the plan should detail how the revitalized development will achieve its reduction in costs. To determine the extent to which projected operating costs are lower than current operating costs, the current per-unit operating costs of the development will be estimated as follows:</P>
            <P>a. If the development has reliable operating costs and if the overall vacancy rate is less than twenty percent, then these costs will be divided by the sum of all occupied units and vacant units fully funded under PFS plus fifty percent of all units not fully funded under PFS. For instance, if the total monthly operating costs of the current development are $6.6 million and it has 1,000 occupied units and 200 vacant units not fully funded under PFS (or a 17 percent overall vacancy rate), then the $6.6 million is divided by 1100—1000 plus 50 percent of 200—to give a per unit figure of $600 per unit month. By this example, the current costs of $600 per occupied unit are at least ten percent higher than the projected costs per occupied unit of $450 for the revitalized development, and the reduction in costs would have to be detailed.</P>
            <P>b. If the development currently lacks reliable cost data or has a vacancy rate of twenty percent or higher, then its current per unit costs will be estimated as follows. First, the per unit cost of the entire authority will be computed, with total costs divided by the sum of all occupied units and vacant units fully funded under PFS plus fifty percent of all vacant units not fully funded under PFS. Second, this amount will be multiplied by the ratio of the bedroom adjustment factor of the development to the bedroom adjustment factor of the Housing Authority. The bedroom adjustment factor, which is based on national rent averages for units grouped by the number of bedrooms and which has been used by HUD to adjust for costs of units when the number of bedrooms vary, assigns to each unit the following factors: .70 for 0-bedroom units, .85 for 1-bedroom units, 1.0 for 2-bedroom units, 1.25 for 3-bedroom units, 1.40 for 4-bedroom units, 1.61 for 5-bedroom units, and 1.82 for 6 or more bedroom units. The bedroom adjustment factor is the unit-weighted average of the distribution. For instance, if the development with one thousand occupied units had in occupancy 500 two-bedroom units and 500 three-bedroom units, then its bedroom adjustment factor would be 1.125—500 times 1.0 plus 500 times 1.25, the sum divided by 1,000. Where necessary, HUD field offices will arrange for assistance in the calculation of the bedroom adjustment factors of the Housing Authority and its affected developments.</P>
            <P>c. As an example of estimating development operating costs from PHA operating costs, suppose that the Housing Authority had a total monthly operating cost per unit of $500 and a bedroom adjustment factor of .90, and suppose that the development had a bedroom adjustment factor of 1.125. Then, the development's estimated current monthly operating cost per occupied unit would be $625—or $500 times 1.25 (the ratio of 1.125 to .90).</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">B. Modernization</HD>

            <P>The cost of modernization is the initial revitalization cost to meet viability standards, that cost amortized over twenty years (which is equivalent to fifteen years at a three percent annual real capital cost for the initial outlay). Expressed in monthly terms, the modernization cost is divided by 180 (or 15 years times 12 months). Thus, if the initial modernization outlay to meet viability standards is $60 million for 1,000 units, then <PRTPAGE P="482"/>the per-unit outlay is $60,000 and the amortized modernization cost is $333 per unit per month (or $60,000 divided by 180). However, when revitalization would be equivalent to new construction and the PHA thus is permitted to amortize the proposed cost over thirty years (which is equivalent to twenty-two and one-half years at a three percent annual real capital cost to the initial outlay), the modernization cost will be divided by 270, the product of 22.5 and 12, to give a cost per unit month of $222.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">C. Accrual</HD>
            <P>The monthly per occupied unit cost of accrual (i.e., replacement needs) will be estimated by using the latest published HUD unit total development cost limits for the area and applying them to the development's structure type and bedroom distribution after modernization, then subtracting from that figure half the per-unit cost of modernization, then multiplying that figure by .02 (representing a fifty year replacement cycle), and dividing this product by 12 to get a monthly cost. For example, if the development will remain a walkup structure containing five hundred two-bedroom occupied and five hundred three-bedroom occupied units, if HUD's Total Development Cost limit for the area is $70,000 for two-bedroom walkup structures and $92,000 for three-bedroom walkup structures, and if the per unit cost of modernization is $60,000, then the estimated monthly cost of accrual per occupied unit is $85. This is the result of multiplying the value of $51,000—the cost guideline value of $81,000 minus half the modernization value of $60,000—by .02 and then dividing by 12.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">D. Overall Cost</HD>
            <P>The overall current cost for continuing the development as public housing is the sum of its monthly post-revitalization operating cost estimates, its monthly modernization cost per occupied unit, and its estimated monthly accrual cost per occupied unit. For example, if the operating cost per occupied unit month is $450 and the amortized modernization cost is $333 and the accrual cost is $85, the overall monthly cost per occupied unit is $868.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Tenant-Based Assistance</HD>

            <P>The estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under Section 8 for all households in occupancy shall be calculated as the unit-weighted averaging of the monthly Fair Market Rents for units of the applicable bedroom size; plus the administrative fee applicable to newly funded Section 8 rental assistance during the year used for calculating public housing operating costs (e.g., the administrative fee for units funded from 10/1/95 through 9/30/96 is based on column C of the January 24, 1995 <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> at 60 FR 4764, and the administrative fee for units funded from 10/1/96 through 9/30/97 is based on column B of the March 12, 1997 <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> at 62 FR 11526); plus the amortized cost of demolishing the occupied public housing units, where the cost per unit is not to exceed ten percent of the TDC prior to amortization. For example, if the development has five hundred occupied two-bedroom units and five hundred occupied three-bedroom units and if the Fair Market Rent in the area is $600 for two bedroom units and is $800 for three bedroom units and if the administrative fee comes to $46 per unit, and if the cost of demolishing 1000 occupied units is $5 million, then the per unit monthly cost of tenant based assistance is $774 ($700 for the unit-weighted average of Fair Market Rents, or 500 times $600 plus 500 times $800 with the sum divided by 1,000; plus $46 for the administrative fee; plus $28 for the amortized cost of demolition and tenant relocation (including any necessary counseling), or $5000 per unit divided by 180 in this example). This Section 8 cost would then be compared to the cost of revitalized public housing development—in the example of this section, the revitalized public housing cost of $868 monthly per occupied unit would exceed the Section 8 cost of $774 monthly per occupied unit by 12 percent. The PHA would have to prepare a conversion plan for the property.</P>
            <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Detailing the Section-8 Cost Comparison: A Summary Table</HD>
            <P>The Section 8 cost comparison methods are summarized, using the example provided in this section III.</P>
            <P>A. Key Data, Development: The revitalized development has 1000 occupied units. All of the units are in walkup buildings. The 1000 occupied units will consist of 500 two-bedroom units and 500 three-bedroom units. The total current operating costs attributable to the development are $300,000 per month in non-utility costs, $100,000 in utility costs paid by the PHA, and $50,000 in utility allowance expenses for utilities paid directly by the tenants to the utility company. Also, the modernization cost for revitalization is $60,000,000, or $60,000 per occupied unit. This will provide standards for viability but not standards for new construction. The cost of demolition and relocation of the 1000 occupied units is $5 million, or $5000 per unit, based on recent experience.</P>

            <P>B. Key Data, Area: The unit total development cost limit is $70,000 for two-bedroom walkups and $92,000 for three-bedroom walkups. The two-bedroom Fair Market Rent is $600 and the three-bedroom Fair Market Rent is $800. The applicable monthly administrative fee amount, in column B of the March 12, 1997 <E T="04">Federal Register</E> Notice, at 62 FR 11526, is $46.<PRTPAGE P="483"/>
            </P>
            <P>C. Preliminary Computation of the Per-Unit Average Total Development Cost of the Development: This results from applying the location's unit total development cost by structure type and number of bedrooms to the occupied units of the development. In this example, five hundred units are valued at $70,000 and five hundred units are valued at $92,000 and the unit-weighted average is $81,000.</P>
            <P>D. Current Per Unit Monthly Occupied Costs of Public Housing:</P>
            <P>1. Operating Cost—$450 (total monthly costs divided by occupied units: in this example, the sum of $300,000 and $100,000 and $50,000—divided by 1,000 units).</P>
            <P>2. Amortized Modernization Cost—$333 ($60,000 per unit divided by 180 for standards less than those of new construction).</P>
            <P>3. Estimated Accrual Cost—$85 (the per-unit average total development cost minus half of the modernization cost per unit, times .02 divided by 12 months: in this example, $51,000 times .02 and then divided by 12).</P>
            <P>4. Total per unit public housing costs—$868.</P>
            <P>E. Current per unit monthly occupied costs of section 8:</P>
            <P>1. Unit-weighted Fair Market Rents—$700 (the unit-weighted average of the Fair Market Rents of occupied bedrooms: in this example, 500 times $600 plus 500 times $800, divided by 1000).</P>
            <P>2. Administrative Fee—$46.</P>
            <P>3. Amortized Demolition and Relocation Cost—$28 ($5000 per unit divided by 180).</P>
            <P>4. Total per unit section 8 costs—$774.</P>
            <P>F. Result: In this example, because revitalized public housing costs exceed current Section 8 costs, a conversion plan for the property would be required.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The purpose of this subpart is to implement section 33 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5), which requires PHAs to annually review their public housing inventory and identify developments, or parts of developments, which must be removed from its stock of public housing operated under an Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) with HUD.</P>
                <P>This subpart provides the procedures a PHA must follow to develop and carry out a conversion plan to remove the units from the public housing inventory, including how to provide for the transition for residents of these developments to other affordable housing.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Definition of “conversion.”</SUBJECT>
                <P>For purposes of this subpart, the term “conversion” means the removal of public housing units from the inventory of a PHA, and the provision of tenant-based or project-based assistance for the residents of the public housing units that are being removed. The term “conversion,” as used in this subpart, does not necessarily mean the physical removal of the public housing development.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedure for required conversion of public housing developments to tenant-based assistance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A PHA must annually review its public housing inventory and identify developments, or parts of developments, which must be converted to tenant-based assistance, in accordance with §§ 972.121-972.127.</P>
                <P>(b) With respect to any public housing development that is identified under paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA generally must develop a 5-year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory, in accordance with §§ 972.130-972.136.</P>
                <P>(c) The PHA may proceed to convert the development if HUD approves the conversion plan.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 972.109</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Conversion of developments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a)(1) The PHA may proceed to convert the development covered by a conversion plan after receiving written approval from HUD. This approval will be separate from the approval that the PHA receives for its Annual Plan.</P>
                <P>(2) HUD anticipates that its review of a conversion plan will ordinarily occur within 90 days following submission of a complete plan by the PHA. A longer process may be required where HUD's initial review of the plan raises questions that require further discussion with the PHA. In any event, HUD will provide all PHAs with a preliminary response within 90 days following submission of a conversion plan.</P>
                <P>(b) The PHA may not demolish or dispose of units or property until completion of the required environmental review under part 58 of this title (if a responsible entity has assumed environmental responsibility for the project) or part 50 of this title (if HUD is performing the environmental review). Further, HUD will not approve a conversion plan until completion of the required environmental review. However, before completion of the environmental review, HUD may approve the targeted units for removal from the PHA's inventory and may authorize the PHA to undertake other activities proposed in its conversion plan that do not require environmental review (such as certain activities related to the relocation of residents), as long as the buildings in question are adequately secured and maintained.</P>

                <P>(c) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility, HUD will consider the conversion plan the PHA submits to be the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and ACC. HUD will notify the PHA in writing whether it has approved the conversion plan. Units that are vacant or vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of <PRTPAGE P="485"/>this title and also will be provided any phase-down of subsidy to which the PHA is entitled pursuant to § 990.114 of this title.</P>
                <P>(d) The PHA may apply for tenant-based assistance in accordance with Section 8 program requirements, and HUD will give the PHA a priority for receiving tenant-based assistance to replace the public housing units. It is HUD's policy to provide funds for one-for-one replacement housing with either public housing or tenant-based assistance, if funds are available. HUD may require that funding for the initial year be provided from the public housing Capital Fund, Operating Fund, or both.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Relationship between required conversion and demolition/disposition requirements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 does not apply to demolition of developments removed from the inventory of the PHA under this subpart. Demolition of these developments is therefore not subject to section 18(g), which provides an exclusion from the applicability of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA). Accordingly, the URA will apply to the displacement of tenants as the direct result of the demolition of a development carried out pursuant to this subpart, in accordance with § 972.118. With respect to any such demolition, the PHA must comply with the requirements for environmental review found at part 58 of this title.</P>
                <P>(b) Section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 does apply to any disposition of developments removed from the inventory of the PHA under this subpart. Therefore, to dispose of property, the PHA must submit a disposition application under section 18. HUD's review of any such disposition application will take into account that the development has been required to be converted.</P>

                <P>HUD actions to approve or deny proposed HOPE VI revitalization plans must be consistent with the requirements of this subpart. Developments with HOPE VI revitalization grants, but without approved HOPE VI revitalization plans, are fully subject to required conversion standards under this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Developments subject to this subpart.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) This subpart is applicable to any development not identified before October 21, 1998, for conversion, or for assessment of whether such conversion is required, in accordance with section 202 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996, 110 Stat. 1321-279—1321-281). Developments identified before October 21, 1998, continue to be subject to the requirements of section 202 and part 971 of this chapter until these requirements are satisfied. Thereafter, the provisions of this subpart apply to any remaining public housing on the sites of those developments.</P>
                <P>(b) The developments to which this subpart is applicable are subject to the requirements of section 33 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437z-5).</P>
                <P>(c) The provisions of this subpart cease to apply when the units in a development that are subject to the requirements of this subpart have been demolished.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Standards for identifying public housing developments subject to required conversion.</SUBJECT>

                <P>The development, or portions thereof, must be converted if it is a general <PRTPAGE P="486"/>occupancy development of 250 or more dwelling units and it meets the following criteria:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">The development is on the same or contiguous sites.</E> This refers to the actual number and location of units, irrespective of HUD development project numbers.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">The development has a vacancy rate of at least a specified percent for dwelling units not in funded, on-schedule modernization, for each of the last three years, and the vacancy rate has not significantly decreased in those three years.</E> (1) For a conversion analysis performed on or before March 16, 2009, the specified vacancy rate is 15 percent. For a conversion analysis performed after that date, the specified vacancy rate is 12 percent.</P>
                <P>(2) For the determination of vacancy rates, the PHA must use the data it relied upon for the PHA's latest Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) certification, as reported on the Form HUD-51234 (report on Occupancy). Units in the following categories must not be included in this calculation:</P>
                <P>(i) Vacant units in an approved demolition or disposition program;</P>
                <P>(ii) Vacant units in which resident property has been abandoned, but only if state law requires the property to be left in the unit for some period of time, and only for the period of time stated in the law;</P>
                <P>(iii) Vacant units that have sustained casualty damage, but only until the insurance claim is adjusted;</P>
                <P>(iv) Units that are occupied by employees of the PHA and units that are used for resident services; and</P>
                <P>(v) Units that HUD determines, in its sole discretion, are intentionally vacant and do not indicate continued distress.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">The development either is distressed housing for which the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing, or more expensive for the PHA to operate as public housing than providing tenant-based assistance.</E> (1) The development is distressed housing for which the PHA cannot assure the long-term viability as public housing through reasonable revitalization, density reduction, or achievement of a broader range of household income. (See § 972.127)</P>
                <P>(i) Properties meeting the standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be assumed to be “distressed,” unless HUD determines that the reasons a property meets such standards are temporary in duration and are unlikely to recur.</P>
                <P>(ii) A development satisfies the long-term viability test only if it is probable that, after reasonable investment, for at least 20 years (or at least 30 years for rehabilitation equivalent to new construction) the development can sustain structural/system soundness and full occupancy; will not be excessively densely configured relative to other similar rental (typically family) housing in the community; can achieve a broader range of family income; and has no other site impairments that clearly should disqualify the site from continuation as public housing.</P>
                <P>(2) The development is more expensive for the PHA to operate as public housing than to provide tenant-based assistance if it has an estimated cost, during the remaining useful life of the project, of continued operation and modernization of the development as public housing in excess of the cost of providing tenant-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for all families in occupancy, based on appropriate indicators of cost (such as the percentage of total development cost required for modernization).</P>
                <P>(i) For purposes of this determination, the costs used for public housing must be those necessary to produce a revitalized development as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) These costs, including estimated operating costs, modernization costs, and accrual needs must be used to develop a per unit monthly cost of continuing the development as public housing.</P>
                <P>(iii) That per unit monthly cost of public housing must be compared to the per unit monthly Section 8 cost.</P>

                <P>(iv) The cost methodology necessary to conduct the cost comparisons for required conversions has not yet been finalized. PHAs are not required to undertake conversions under this subpart until six months after the effective date of the cost methodology, which <PRTPAGE P="487"/>will be announced in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Once effective, the cost methodology will be codified as an appendix to this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Standards for determining whether a property is viable in the long term.</SUBJECT>
                <P>In order for a property to meet the standard of long-term viability, as discussed in § 972.124, the following criteria must be met:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">The investment to be made in the development is reasonable.</E> (1) Proposed revitalization costs for viability must be reasonable. Such costs must not exceed, and ordinarily would be substantially less than, 90 percent of HUD's total development cost (TDC) limit for the units proposed to be revitalized (100 percent of the total development cost limit for any “infill” new construction subject to this regulation). The revitalization cost estimate used in the PHA's most recent Annual Plan or 5-Year Plan is to be used for this purpose, unless the PHA demonstrates, or HUD determines, that another cost estimate is clearly more realistic to ensure viability and to sustain the operating costs that are described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) The overall projected cost of the revitalized development must not exceed the Section 8 cost under the method contained in the Appendix to this part, even if the cost of revitalization is a lower percentage of the TDC than the limits stated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) The source of funding for such a revitalization program must be identified and available. In addition to other resources already available to the PHA, it may assume that future formula funds provided through the Capital Fund over five years are available for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Appropriate density is achieved.</E> The resulting public housing development must have a density which is comparable to that which prevails in or is appropriate for assisted rental housing or for other similar types of housing in the community (typically family).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">A greater income mix can be achieved.</E> (1) Measures generally will be required to broaden the range of resident incomes over time to include a significant mix of households with at least one full-time worker. Measures to achieve a broader range of household incomes must be realistic in view of the site's location. Appropriate evidence typically would include census or other recent statistical evidence demonstrating some mix of incomes of other households located in the same census tract or neighborhood, or unique advantages of the public housing site.</P>
                <P>(2) For purposes of judging appropriateness of density reduction and broader range of income measures, overall size of the public housing site and its number of dwelling units will be considered. The concerns these measures would address generally are greater as the site's size and number of dwelling units increase.</P>

                <P>(a) With respect to any development that is identified under §§ 972.121 through 972.127, the PHA generally must develop a 5-year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the inventory. The plan must consider relocation alternatives for households in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based assistance, and must provide for relocation from the units as soon as possible. For planning purposes, the PHA must assume that HUD will be able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental assistance. The plan must include:</P>
                <P>(1) A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the inventory;</P>
                <P>(2) Identification and obligation status of any previously approved modernization, reconstruction, or other capital funds for the distressed development and the PHA's recommendations concerning transfer of these funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;</P>

                <P>(3) A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected development and the unit of local government where the public housing is located, as set forth in § 972.133;<PRTPAGE P="488"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) A description of the plans for demolition or disposition of the public housing units; and</P>
                <P>(5) A relocation plan, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Relocation plan.</E> The relocation plan must incorporate all of the information identified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section. In addition, if the required conversion is subject to the URA, the relocation plan must also contain the information identified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The relocation plan must incorporate the following:</P>
                <P>(1) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, and by the number of accessible units.</P>
                <P>(2) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.</P>
                <P>(3) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families displaced by the conversion).</P>
                <P>(4) Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in the development in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Timing of notice.</E> If the required conversion is not subject to the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days before displacement. If the required conversion is subject to the URA the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a required conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> The written notice shall include all of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) The development must be removed from the public housing inventory and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;</P>
                <P>(B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon the relocation of the family into such housing);</P>
                <P>(C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);</P>
                <P>(D) Such families will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;</P>
                <P>(E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent; and</P>
                <P>(F) Where section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement.</P>
                <P>(5) If the required conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (b)(4) must also provide that:</P>
                <P>(i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing, as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;</P>
                <P>(ii) Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208;</P>
                <P>(iii) The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family may be eligible under this subpart and URA;</P>

                <P>(iv) Families residing in the development will be provided with the URA <PRTPAGE P="489"/>Notice of Relocation Eligibility or Notice of Non-displacement (as applicable) as of the date HUD approves the conversion plan (for purposes of this subpart, the date of HUD's approval of the conversion plan shall be the “date of initiation of negotiations” as that term is used in URA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24); and</P>
                <P>(v) Any family that moves into the development after submission of the conversion plan to HUD will also be eligible for relocation assistance, unless the PHA issues a written move-in notice to the family prior to leasing and occupancy of the unit advising the family of the development's possible conversion, the impact of the conversion on the family, and that the family will not be eligible for relocation assistance.</P>
                <P>(c) The conversion plan may not be more than a 5-year plan, unless the PHA applies for and receives approval from HUD for a longer period of time. HUD may allow the PHA up to 10 years to remove the units from the inventory, in exceptional circumstances where HUD determines that this is clearly the most cost effective and beneficial means of providing housing assistance over that same period. For example, HUD may allow a longer period of time to remove the units from the public housing inventory, where more than one development is being converted, and a larger number of families require relocation than can easily be absorbed into the rental market at one time, provided the housing has a remaining useful life of longer than five years and the longer time frame will assist in relocation.</P>

                <P>(b) If a PHA fails to take the conversion activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will:</P>
                <P>(1) Disqualify the PHA from HUD funding competitions; and</P>
                <P>(2) Direct the PHA to cease additional spending in connection with a development that meets, or is likely to meet the statutory criteria, except to the extent that failure to expend such amounts would endanger health or safety.</P>
                <P>(c) If a PHA fails to take the conversion activities described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD may also take any or all of the following actions:</P>
                <P>(1) Identify developments that fall within the statutory criteria where the PHA has failed to do so properly;</P>
                <P>(2) Take appropriate actions to ensure the conversion of developments where the PHA has failed to adequately develop or implement a conversion plan;</P>
                <P>(3) Require the PHA to revise the conversion plan, or prohibit conversion, where HUD has determined that the PHA has erroneously identified a development as being subject to the requirements of this section;</P>
                <P>(4) Authorize or direct the transfer of capital or operating funds committed to or on behalf of the development (including comprehensive improvement assistance, comprehensive grant or Capital Fund amounts attributable to the development's share of funds under the formula, and major reconstruction of obsolete projects funds) to tenant-based assistance or appropriate site revitalization for the agency; and</P>
                <P>(5) Any other action that HUD determines appropriate and has the authority to undertake.</P>

                <P>For purposes of this subpart, the term “conversion” means the removal of public housing units from the inventory of a Public Housing Agency (PHA), and the provision of tenant-based, or project-based assistance for the residents of the public housing that is being removed. The term “conversion,” as used in this subpart, does not necessarily mean the physical removal of the public housing development from the site.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A PHA must conduct a required initial assessment (which consists of the certification described in paragraph (b) of this section), in accordance with this section, once for each of its developments, unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The development is subject to required conversion under 24 CFR part 971;</P>
                <P>(2) The development is the subject of an application for demolition or disposition that has not been disapproved by HUD;</P>
                <P>(3) A HOPE VI revitalization grant has been awarded for the development; or</P>

                <P>(4) The development is designated for occupancy by the elderly and/or persons with disabilities (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> is not a general occupancy development).</P>

                <P>(1) Reviewed the development's operation as public housing;</P>
                <P>(2) Considered the implications of converting the public housing to tenant-based assistance; and</P>

                <P>(3) Concluded that conversion of the development may be:<PRTPAGE P="491"/>
                </P>
                <P>(i) Appropriate because removal of the development would meet the necessary conditions for voluntary conversion described in § 972.224; or</P>

                <SUBJECT>Procedure for voluntary conversion of public housing developments to tenant-based assistance.</SUBJECT>
                <P>A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing development to tenant-based assistance must comply with the following process:</P>
                <P>(a) The PHA must perform a conversion assessment, in accordance with §§ 972.218-972.224 and submit it to HUD as part of the next PHA Annual Plan submission.</P>
                <P>(b) The PHA must prepare a conversion plan, in accordance with § 972.227-972.233, and submit it to HUD, as part of its PHA Annual Plan, within one year after submitting the conversion assessment. The PHA may submit the conversion plan in the same Annual Plan as the conversion assessment.</P>
                <P>(c) The PHA may proceed to convert the development if HUD approves the conversion plan.</P>
              </SECTION>
              <SECTION>
                <SECTNO>§ 972.212</SECTNO>
                <SUBJECT>Timing of voluntary conversion.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) A PHA may proceed to convert a development covered by a conversion plan only after receiving written approval of the conversion plan from HUD. This approval will be separate from the approval that the PHA receives for its PHA Annual Plan. A PHA may apply for tenant-based assistance in accordance with Section 8 program requirements and will be given priority for receiving tenant-based assistance to replace the public housing units.</P>
                <P>(b) A PHA may not demolish or dispose of units or property until completion of the required environmental review under part 58 of this title (if a Responsible Entity has assumed environmental responsibility for the project) or part 50 of this title (if HUD is performing the environmental review). Further, HUD will not approve a conversion plan until completion of the required environmental review. However, before completion of the environmental review, HUD may approve the targeted units for deprogramming and may authorize the PHA to undertake other activities proposed in the conversion plan that do not require environmental review (such as certain activities related to the relocation of residents), as long as the buildings in question are adequately secured and maintained.</P>
                <P>(c) For purposes of determining operating subsidy eligibility, the submitted conversion plan will be considered the equivalent of a formal request to remove dwelling units from the PHA's inventory and Annual Contributions Contract (ACC). Units that are vacant or are vacated on or after the written notification date will be treated as approved for deprogramming under § 990.108(b)(1) of this title, and will also be provided the phase down of subsidy pursuant to § 990.114 of this title.</P>
                <P>(d) HUD may require that funding for the initial year of tenant-based assistance be provided from the public housing Capital Fund, Operating Fund, or both.</P>

                <P>To the extent that tenants are displaced as a direct result of the demolition, acquisition, or rehabilitation of federally-assisted property converted under this subpart, the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) (URA), and the implementing regulations issued by the Department of Transportation at 49 CFR part 24, apply.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Conversion assessment components.</SUBJECT>
                <P>The conversion assessment contains five elements, as described below:</P>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Cost analysis.</E> A PHA must conduct a cost analysis comparing the cost of providing Section 8 tenant-based assistance with the cost of continuing to operate the development as public housing for the remainder of its useful life. The cost methodology necessary to conduct the cost comparisons for voluntary conversions has not yet been finalized. PHAs may not undertake conversions under this subpart until the effective date of the cost methodology, which will be announced in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Once effective, the cost methodology will be codified as an appendix to this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Analysis of the market value.</E> (1) A PHA must have an independent appraisal conducted to compare the market value of the development before and after rehabilitation. In both cases, the market value must be based on the use of the development as public housing.</P>
                <P>(2) In addition, the appraisal must compare:</P>
                <P>(i) The market value of the development before rehabilitation, based on the use of the development as public housing, with the market value of the development after conversion; with</P>
                <P>(ii) The market value of the development after rehabilitation, based on the use of the development as public housing, with the market value of the development after conversion.</P>
                <P>(3) A copy of the appraisal findings and the analysis of market value of the development in the conversion assessment must be provided in the conversion assessment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Analysis of rental market conditions.</E> (1) A PHA must conduct an analysis of the likely success of using tenant-based assistance for the residents of the public housing development. This analysis must include an assessment of the availability of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling units rented at or below the applicable Section 8 payment standard established for the jurisdiction or designated part of the FMR area in which the development is located.</P>
                <P>(2) In conducting this assessment, a PHA must take into account:</P>
                <P>(i) Its overall use of rental certificates or vouchers under lease and the success rates of using Section 8 tenant-based assistance in the community for the appropriate bedroom sizes, including recent success rates for units renting at or below the established payment standard; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Any particular characteristics of the specific residents of the public housing which may affect their ability to be housed (such as large household size or the presence of an elderly or disabled family member).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Impact analysis.</E> A PHA must describe the likely impact of conversion of the public housing development on the neighborhood in which the public housing is located. This must include:</P>
                <P>(1) The impact on the availability of affordable housing in the neighborhood;</P>
                <P>(2) The impact on the concentration of poverty in the neighborhood; and</P>
                <P>(3) Other substantial impacts on the neighborhood.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Conversion implementation.</E> If a PHA intends to convert the development (or a portion of it) to tenant-based assistance, the conversion assessment must include a description of any actions the PHA plans to take in converting the development. This must include a general description of the planned future uses of the development, and the means and timetable for accomplishing such uses.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Submission with PHA Plan.</E> A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing development to tenant-based assistance must submit a conversion assessment to HUD with its next PHA Annual Plan.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Updated conversion assessment.</E> Where a PHA proposes to convert a development to tenant-based assistance, it must submit an updated conversion assessment if the conversion assessment otherwise would be more than one year older than the conversion plan to be submitted to HUD. To update a conversion assessment, a PHA <PRTPAGE P="493"/>must ensure that the analysis of rental market conditions is based on the most recently available data, and must include any data that have changed since the initial conversion assessment. A PHA may submit the initial cost analysis and comparison of the market value of the public housing before and after rehabilitation and/or conversion if there is no reason to believe that such information has changed significantly.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Necessary conditions for HUD approval of conversion.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions.</E> In order to convert a public housing development, the PHA must conduct a conversion assessment that demonstrates that the conversion of the development:</P>
                <P>(1) Will not be more expensive than continuing to operate the development (or portion of it) as public housing;</P>
                <P>(2) Will principally benefit the residents of the public housing development (or portion thereof) to be converted, the PHA, and the community; and</P>
                <P>(3) Will not adversely affect the availability of affordable housing in the community.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">Relative expense.</E> The relative expense of continuing operation as public housing or conversion to tenant-based assistance may be demonstrated by the cost analysis and market value analysis.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Benefit to residents, PHA, and the community.</E> (i) The benefit to residents, the PHA, and the community may be demonstrated in the rental market analysis, the analysis of the impact on the neighborhood, the market value analysis, and the proposed future use of the development. In determining whether a conversion will principally benefit residents, the PHA, and the community, HUD will consider whether the conversion will conflict with any litigation settlement agreements, voluntary compliance agreements, or other remedial agreements signed by the PHA with HUD.</P>
                <P>(ii) In making the determination of whether a conversion would principally benefit residents, the PHA, and the community, the PHA must consider such factors as the availability of landlords providing tenant-based assistance, as well as access to schools, jobs, and transportation.</P>
                <P>(iii) To determine the benefit to residents, the PHA must hold at least one public meeting with residents of the affected site (including the duly elected Resident Council, if any, that covers the development in question). At the meeting, the PHA must:</P>
                <P>(A) Explain the requirements of section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and these regulations, especially as they apply to residents of affected developments;</P>
                <P>(B) Provide draft copies of the conversion assessment to the residents; and</P>
                <P>(C) Provide the residents with a reasonable period of time to submit comments on the draft conversion assessment.</P>
                <P>(iv) The conversion assessment submitted to HUD must contain a summary of the resident comments, and the PHA responses to any significant issues raised by the commenters.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Impact on affordable housing.</E> The impact on affordable housing may be demonstrated in the rental market analysis and the analysis of the impact of conversion on the neighborhood.</P>

                <P>(f) Summarize why the conversion assessment for the public housing project supports the three conditions necessary for conversion described in § 972.224.</P>
                <P>(g) Include a relocation plan that incorporates all of the information identified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) of this section. In addition, if the required conversion is subject to the URA, the relocation plan must also contain the information identified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.

                <P>(1) The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, by the number of accessible units.</P>
                <P>(2) The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.</P>
                <P>(3) A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families displaced by the conversion).</P>
                <P>(4) Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in the development in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Timing of notice.</E> If the voluntary conversion is not subject to the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days before displacement. If the voluntary conversion is subject to the URA the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a voluntary conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Contents of notice.</E> The written notice shall include all of the following:</P>
                <P>(A) The development will no longer be used as public housing and that the family may be displaced as a result of the conversion;</P>

                <P>(B) The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include <PRTPAGE P="495"/>tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon relocation of the family into such housing);</P>
                <P>(C) Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or Section 8 administrative fee funding);</P>
                <P>(D) The family will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing of their choice;</P>
                <P>(E) If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing, using tenant-based assistance towards rent;</P>
                <P>(F) Where Section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation, the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before displacement;</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Additional information required for conversions subject to the URA.</E> If the voluntary conversion is subject to the URA, the written notice described in paragraph (g)(4) must also provide that:</P>
                <P>(i) The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be required to move, and that the family will not be required to move permanently until the family is offered comparable housing as provided in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;</P>

                <P>A PHA that wishes to convert a public housing project to tenant-based assistance must submit a conversion plan to HUD. A PHA must prepare a conversion plan, in accordance with § 972.230, and submit it to HUD, as part of the next PHA Annual Plan within one year after submitting the full conversion assessment, or as a significant amendment to that Annual Plan. The PHA may also submit the conversion plan in the same Annual Plan as the conversion assessment.</P>

                <P>Although a PHA will submit its conversion plan to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan, the conversion plan will be treated separately for purposes of HUD approval. A PHA needs a separate written approval from HUD in order to proceed with conversion. HUD anticipates that its review of a conversion plan will ordinarily occur within 90 days following submission of a complete plan by the PHA. A longer process may be required where HUD's initial review of the plan raises questions that require further discussion with <PRTPAGE P="496"/>the PHA. In any event, HUD will provide all PHAs with a preliminary response within 90 days following submission of a conversion plan. A lack of a HUD response within this time frame will constitute automatic HUD approval of the conversion plan.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix to Part 972—Methodology of Comparing Cost of Public Housing With the Cost of Tenant-Based Assistance</HD>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Public Housing-Net Present Value</HD>

              <P>The costs used for public housing shall be those necessary to produce a viable development for its projected useful life. The estimated cost for the continued operation of the development as public housing shall be calculated as the sum of total operating cost, modernization cost, and costs to address accrual needs. Costs will be calculated at the property level on an annual basis covering a period of 30 years (with options for 20 or 40 years). All costs expected to occur in future years will be discounted, using an OMB-specified real discount rate provided on the OMB Web site at <E T="03">http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/Budget</E>, for each year after the initial year. The sum of the discounted values for each year (net present value) for public housing will then be compared to the net present value of the stream of costs associated with housing vouchers.</P>

              <P>Applicable information on discount rates may be found in Appendix C of OMB Circular A-94, “Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,” which is updated annually, and may be found on OMB's Web site at <E T="03">http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB.</E> All cost adjustments conducted pursuant to this cost methodology must be performed using the real discount rates provided on the OMB Web site at <E T="03">http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/Budget.</E> HUD will also provide information on current rates, along with guidance and instructions for completing the cost comparisons on the HUD Homepage (<E T="03">http://www.hud.gov</E>). The Homepage will also include a downloadable spreadsheet calculator that HUD has developed to assist PHAs in completing the assessments. The spreadsheet calculator is designed to walk housing agencies through the calculations and comparisons laid out in the appendix and allows housing agencies to enter relevant data for their PHA and the development being assessed. Results, including net present values, are generated based on these housing agency data.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Operating Costs</HD>

              <P>1. Any proposed revitalization or modernization plan must indicate how unusually high current operating expenses (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, security, supportive services, maintenance, tenant, and PHA-paid utilities) will be reduced as a result of post-revitalization changes in occupancy, density and building configuration, income mix, and management. The plan must make a realistic projection of overall operating costs per occupied unit in the revitalized or modernized development, by relating those operating costs to the expected occupancy rate, tenant composition, physical configuration, and management structure of the revitalized or modernized development. The projected costs should also address the comparable costs of buildings or developments whose siting, configuration, and tenant mix is similar to that of the revitalized or modernized public housing development.</P>

              <P>2. The development's operating cost (including all overhead costs pro-rated to the development—including a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (P.I.L.O.T.) or some other comparable payment, and including utilities and utility allowances) shall be expressed as total operating costs per year. For example, if a development will have 375 units occupied by households and will have $112,500 monthly non-utility costs (including pro-rated overhead costs and appropriate P.I.L.O.T.) and $37,500 monthly utility costs paid by the PHA, and $18,750 in monthly utility allowances that are deducted from tenant rental payments to the PHA because tenants paid some utility bills directly to the utility company, then the development's monthly operating cost is $168,750 (or $450 per unit per month) and its annual operating cost would be $5,400 ($450 times 12). Operating costs are assumed to begin in the initial year of the <PRTPAGE P="497"/>30-year (or alternative period) calculation and will be incurred in each year thereafter.</P>
              <P>3. In justifying the operating cost estimates as realistic, the plan should link the cost estimates to its assumptions about the level and rate of occupancy, the per-unit funding of modernization, any physical reconfiguration that will result from modernization, any planned changes in the surrounding neighborhood, and security costs. The plan should also show whether developments or buildings in viable condition in similar neighborhoods have achieved the income mix and occupancy rate projected for the revitalized or modernized development. The plan should also show how the operating costs of the similar developments or buildings compare to the operating costs projected for the development.</P>
              <P>4. In addition to presenting evidence that the operating costs of the revitalized or modernized development are plausible, when the projected initial year per-unit operating cost of the renovated development is lower than the current per unit cost by more than 10 percent, then the plan should detail how the revitalized development will achieve this reduction in costs. To determine the extent to which projected operating costs are lower than current operating costs, the current per-unit operating costs of the development will be estimated as follows:</P>
              <P>a. If the development has reliable operating costs and if the overall vacancy rate is less than 20 percent, then the development-based method will be used to determine projected costs. The current costs will be divided by the sum of all occupied units and vacant units fully funded under the Operating Fund Program plus 20 percent of all units not fully funded under the Operating Fund Program. For instance, if the total monthly operating costs of the current development are $168,750 and it has 325 occupied units and 50 vacant units not fully funded under the Operating Fund Program (or a 13 percent overall vacancy rate), then the $2,250,000 is divided by 335—325 plus 20 percent of 50—to give a per unit figure of $504 per unit month. By this example, the current costs per occupied unit are at least 10 percent higher (12 percent in this example) than the projected costs per occupied unit of $450 for the revitalized development, and the reduction in costs would have to be detailed.</P>
              <P>b. If the development currently lacks reliable cost data or has a vacancy rate of 20 percent or higher, then the PHA-wide method will be used to determine projected costs. First, the current per unit cost of the entire PHA will be computed, with total costs divided by the sum of all occupied units and vacant units fully funded under the Operating Fund Program plus 20 percent of all vacant units not fully funded under the Operating Fund Program. For example, if the PHA's operating cost is $18 million, and the PHA has 4,000 units, of which 3,875 are occupied and 125 are vacant and not fully funded under the Operating Fund Program, then the PHA's vacancy adjusted operating cost is $385 per unit per month—$18,000,000 divided by the 3,825 (the sum of 3,800 occupied units and 20 percent of 125 vacant units) divided by 12 months. Second, this amount will be multiplied by the ratio of the bedroom adjustment factor of the development to the bedroom adjustment factor of the PHA. The bedroom adjustment factor, which is based on national rent averages for units grouped by the number of bedrooms and which has been used by HUD to adjust for costs of units when the number of bedrooms vary, assigns to each unit the following factors: .70 for 0-bedroom units, .85 for 1-bedroom units, 1.0 for 2-bedroom units, 1.25 for 3-bedroom units, 1.40 for 4-bedroom units, 1.61 for 5-bedroom units, and 1.82 for 6 or more bedroom units. The bedroom adjustment factor is the unit-weighted average of the distribution. For instance, consider a development with 375 occupied units that had the following under an ACC contract: 200 two-bedroom units, 150 three-bedroom units, and 25 four-bedroom units. In that example, the bedroom adjustment factor would be 1.127—200 times 1.0, plus 150 times 1.25, plus 25 times 1.4 with the sum divided by 375. Where necessary, HUD field offices will arrange for assistance in the calculation of the bedroom adjustment factors of the PHA and its affected developments.</P>
              <P>c. As an example of estimating development operating costs from PHA-wide operating costs, suppose that the PHA had a total monthly operating cost per unit of $385 and a bedroom adjustment factor of .928, and suppose that the development had a bedroom adjustment factor of 1.127. Then, the development's estimated current monthly operating cost per occupied unit would be $467—or $385 times 1.214 (the ratio of 1.127 to .928). By this example, the development's current operating costs of $467 per unit per month are not more than 10 percent higher (3.8 percent in this example) than the projected costs of $450 per unit per month and no additional justification of the cost reduction would be required.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Modernization</HD>

              <P>Under both the required and voluntary conversion programs, PHAs prepare modernization or capital repair estimates in accordance with the physical needs of the specific properties proposed for conversion. There are three key assumptions that guide how PHAs prepare modernization estimates that affect remaining useful life and determine whether the 20-, 30-, or discretionary 40-year remaining useful life evaluation period are used for the cost-test. When calculating public housing revitalization costs for <PRTPAGE P="498"/>a property, PHAs will use a 30-year period if the level of modernization addresses all accumulated backlog needs and the planned redesign ensures long-term viability. For modernization equivalent to new construction or when the renovations restore a property to as-new physical conditions, a 40-year remaining useful life test is used. When light or moderate rehabilitation that does not address all accumulated backlog is undertaken, but it is compliant with the International Existing Building Codes (ICC) or Public Housing Modernization Standards in the absence of a local rehabilitation code, the 20-year remaining useful life evaluation period must be used.</P>
              <P>Except for some voluntary conversion situations as explained in paragraph E below, the cost of modernization is, at a minimum, the initial revitalization cost to meet viability standards. In the absence of a local code, PHAs may refer to the Public Housing Modernization Standards Handbook (Handbook 7485.2) or the International Existing Building Codes (ICC) 2003 Edition. To justify a 40-year amortization cycle that increases the useful life period and time over which modernization costs are amortized, PHAs must demonstrate that the proposed modernization meets the applicable physical viability standards, but must also cover accumulated backlog and redesign that achieves as-new physical conditions to ensure long-term viability. To be a plausible estimate, modernization costs shall be justified by a newly created property-based needs assessment (a life-cycle physical needs assessments prepared in accordance with a PHA's Capital Fund annual or 5-year action plan and shall be able to be reconciled with standardized measures, such as components of the PHAs physical inspection and chronic vacancy due to physical condition and design. Modernization costs may be assumed to occur during years one through four, consistent with the level of work proposed and the PHA's proposed modernization schedule. For example, if the initial modernization outlay (excluding demolition costs) to meet viability standards is $21,000,000 for 375 units, a PHA might incur costs in three equal increments of $7,000,000 in years two, three, and four (based on the PHA's phased modernization plan). In comparing the net present value of public housing to voucher costs for required conversion, a 30-year amortization period will normally be used, except when revitalization would bring the property to as-new condition and a 40-year amortization would be justified. On the other hand, when the modernization falls short of meeting accumulated backlog and long-term redesign needs, only a 20-year amortization period might be justified.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Accrual</HD>
              <P>Accrual projections estimate the ongoing replacement repair needs for public housing properties and building structures and systems required to maintain the physical viability of a property throughout its useful life as the lifecycle of building structures and systems expire. The cost of accrual (i.e., replacement needs) will be estimated with an algorithm that meets all ongoing capital needs based on systems that have predictable lifecycles. The algorithm starts with the area index of housing construction costs (HCC) that HUD publishes as a component of its TDC index series. Subtracted from this HCC figure is half the estimated modernization per unit, with a coefficient of .025 multiplied by the result to provide an annual accrual figure per unit. For example, suppose that the development after modernization will remain a walkup structure containing 200 two-bedroom, 150 three-bedroom, and 25 four-bedroom occupied units, and if HUD's HCC limit for the area is $66,700 for two-bedroom walkup structures, $93,000 for three-bedroom walkup structures, and $108,400 for four-bedroom walkup structures. Then the unit-weighted HCC cost is $80,000 per unit and .75 of that figure is $60,000 per unit. Then, if the per unit cost of the modernization is $56,000, the estimated annual cost of accrual per occupied unit is $1,300. This is the result of multiplying .025 times $52,000 (the weighted HCC of $80,000) minus $28,000 (half the per-unit modernization cost of $56,000). The first year of total accrual for the development is $487,500 ($1,300 times 375 units) and should be assumed to begin in the year after modernization is complete. Accrual—like operating cost—is an annual expense and will occur in each year over the amortized period. Because the method assumes full physical renewal each year, this accrual method when combined with a modernization that meets past backlog and redesign needs justifies a 30- or 40-year amortization period, because the property is refreshed each year to as-new or almost as-new condition.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Residual Value (Voluntary Conversion Only)</HD>

              <P>Under the voluntary conversion program, PHAs are required to prepare market appraisals based on the “as-is” and post-rehabilitation condition of properties, assuming the buildings are operated as public or assisted, unassisted, or market-rate housing. Section 972.218 requires PHAs to describe the future use for a property proposed for conversion and to describe the means and timetable to complete these activities. HUD will permit a PHA to enter the appraised market value of a property into the cost-test in Years 1 through 5 when a PHA anticipates selling a property or receiving income generated from the sale or lease of a property.<PRTPAGE P="499"/>
              </P>
              <P>As a separate line item to be added to total public costs as a foregone opportunity cost, a PHA shall include in the voluntary cost-test calculations the appraised market or residual value (or net sales proceeds) from the sale or lease of a property that is to be voluntarily converted to tenant-based voucher assistance. The PHA must hire an appraiser to estimate the market value of the property using the comparable sale, tax-assessment, or revenue-based appraisal methods. PHAs are advised to select one or more of these appraisal methods to accurately determine the actual or potential market value of a property, particularly the comparable sales or revenue-based methods. The market or residual value is to be determined by calculating the estimated market value for the property based on the appraisal, minus any costs required for demolition and remediation. The residual value must be incorporated into the cost-test instead of the actual market value only when any demolition, site remediation, and clearance costs that are necessary are covered by the selling PHA. However, if the sum of the estimated per unit cost of demolition and remediation exceeds 10 percent of the average Total Development Cost (TDC) for the units, the lower of the PHA estimate or a figure based on 10 percent of TDC must be used. Suppose the estimated remediation and demolition costs necessary for conversion sale are $7,000 per unit. Also, suppose the TDC limits are $115,000 for a two-bedroom unit, $161,000 for a three-bedroom unit, and $184,000 for a four-bedroom unit. Then the average TDC of a development with 200 two-bedroom units, 150 three-bedroom units, and 25 four-bedroom units is $138,000 (200 times $115,000, plus 150 times $161,000, plus 25 times $184,000, the sum divided by 375) and 10 percent of TDC is $13,800. In this example, the estimated $7,000 per unit costs for demolition and remediation is less than 10 percent of TDC for the development, and the PHA estimate of $7,000 is used. If estimated expenses had exceeded 10 percent of TDC ($13,800 in this example), demolition and remediation expenses must be capped at the lower amount.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Accumulated Discounted Cost: Public Housing</HD>
              <P>The overall cost for continuing to operate the development as public housing is the sum of the discounted values of the yearly stream of costs up for the amortization period, which can range from 20 to 30 to 40 years, depending on the extent of modernization relative to the current physical and redesign needs of the development. In calculating net present value for required conversion, the sum of all costs in each future year is discounted back to the current year using the OMB-specified real discount rate. For voluntary conversion, the discount rate is applied forward as a direct inflation factor. To assist PHAs in completing the net present value comparison and to ensure consistency in the calculations, HUD has developed a spreadsheet calculator that is available for downloading from the HUD Internet site. Using PHA data and property specific inputs (to be entered by the housing agency), the spreadsheet will discount costs as described above and will generate net present values for amortization periods of 20, 30, and 40 years.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Tenant-Based Assistance</HD>
              <P>The estimated cost of providing tenant-based assistance under Section 8 for all households in occupancy shall be calculated as the unit-weighted average of recent movers in the local area; plus the administrative fee for providing such vouchers; plus $1,000 per unit (or a higher amount allowed by HUD) for relocation assistance costs, including counseling. However, if the sum of the estimated per unit cost of demolition, remediation, and relocation exceeds 10 percent of the average Total Development Cost (TDC) for the units, the lower of the PHA estimate or a figure based on 10 percent of TDC must be used.</P>
              <P>For example, if the development has 200 occupied two-bedroom units, 150 occupied three-bedroom units, and 25 occupied four-bedroom units, and if the monthly payment standard for voucher units occupied by recent movers is $550 for two-bedroom units, $650 for three-bedroom units, and $750 for four-bedroom units, the unit-weighted monthly payment standard is $603.33. If the administrative fee comes to $46 per unit, then the monthly per unit operating voucher costs are $649.33, which rounds to an annual total of $2,922,000 for 375 occupied units of the same bedroom size as those being demolished in public housing. To these operating voucher costs, a first-year relocation is added on the voucher side. For per-unit relocation costs of $1,000 per unit for relocation, then $375,000 for 375 units is placed on the voucher cost side of the first year.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Accumulated Discounted Cost: Vouchers</HD>

              <P>The overall cost for vouchers is the sum of the discounted values of the yearly stream of costs up for the amortization period, which can range from 20 to 30 to 40 years, depending on the extent of modernization relative to the current physical and redesign needs of the development. The amortization period chosen is the one that was appropriate for discounting public housing costs. In calculating net present value for required conversion, the sum of all costs in each future year is discounted back to the current year using the OMB-specified real discount rate. For voluntary conversion, the discount rate is applied forward as a direct inflation factor.<PRTPAGE P="500"/>
              </P>
              <P>To assist PHAs in completing the net present value comparison and to ensure consistency in the calculations, HUD has developed a spreadsheet calculator that will be available for downloading from the HUD Internet site.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Results of the Example</HD>
              <P>With the hypothetical data used in the examples, under an amortization period of 30 years, the discounted public housing costs under required conversion sums to $69,633,225, and the discounted voucher cost under required conversions totals $60,438,698. The ratio is 1.15, which means that public housing is 15 percent more costly than vouchers. With this amortization and this data, the PHA would be required to convert the development under the requirements of subpart A of this part, except in a situation where a PHA can demonstrate a distressed property that has failed the cost-test can be redeveloped by meeting each of the four factors that compose the long-term physical viability test to avoid removal from the inventory. With the same data, but a 40-year amortization period, public housing is still 11 percent costlier than vouchers, and with a 20-year amortization, public housing is 25 percent costlier than vouchers. In voluntary conversion, with the same hypothetical data, but a slightly different methodology (use of residual value as a public housing cost, inflating forward the discount numbers), the ratio of public housing costs to voucher costs would be 1.16 for the 20-year amortization period, 1.03 for the 30-year amortization period, and .97 for the 20-year amortization period. Thus, in voluntary conversion, the appropriate amortization period would decide whether public housing is more costly or is slightly more costly, or less than vouchers. Under a 20-year amortization assumption and possibly under a 30-year amortization period, the PHA would have the option of preparing a conversion plan for the development under subpart B of this part. Different sets of data would yield different conclusions for required and voluntary conversion determinations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Programs: purpose and structure.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General description.</E> (1) In the HUD Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, HUD pays rental subsidies so eligible families can afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The HCV program is generally administered by State or local governmental entities called public housing agencies (PHAs). HUD provides housing assistance funds to the PHA. HUD also provides funds for PHA administration of the program.</P>
              <P>(2) Families select and rent units that meet program housing quality standards. If the PHA approves a family's unit and tenancy, the PHA contracts with the owner to make rent subsidy payments on behalf of the family. A PHA may not approve a tenancy unless the rent is reasonable.</P>
              <P>(3) Subsidy in the HCV program is based on a local “payment standard” that reflects the cost to lease a unit in the local housing market. If the rent is less than the payment standard, the family generally pays 30 percent of adjusted monthly income for rent. If the rent is more than the payment standard, the family pays a larger share of the rent.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tenant-based and project-based assistance.</E> (1) Section 8 assistance may be “tenant-based” or “project-based”. In project-based programs, rental assistance is paid for families who live in specific housing developments or units. With tenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family. The family may rent a unit anywhere in the United States in the jurisdiction of a PHA that runs a voucher program.</P>

              <P>(2) To receive tenant-based assistance, the family selects a suitable unit. After approving the tenancy, the PHA enters into a contract to make rental subsidy payments to the owner to subsidize occupancy by the family. The PHA contract with the owner only covers a single unit and a specific assisted family. If the family moves out of the leased unit, the contract with the owner terminates. The family may <PRTPAGE P="503"/>move to another unit with continued assistance so long as the family is complying with program requirements.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section applies to the renewal of consolidated ACC <PRTPAGE P="510"/>funding increments in the program (as described in § 982.151(a)(2)) that expire after December 31, 1999 (including any assistance that the PHA has attached to units for project-based assistance under 24 CFR part 983). This section implements section 8(dd) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(dd)).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Renewal Methodology.</E> HUD will use the following methodology to determine the amount of budget authority to be allocated to a PHA for the renewal of expiring consolidated ACC funding increments in the program, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. If the amount of appropriated funds is not sufficient to provide the full amount of renewal funding for PHAs, as calculated in accordance with this section, HUD may establish a procedure to adjust allocations for the shortfall in funding.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determining the amount of budget authority allocated for renewal of an expiring funding increment.</E> Subject to availability of appropriated funds, as determined by HUD, the amount of budget authority allocated by HUD to a PHA for renewal of each program funding increment that expires during a calendar year will be equal to:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Number of renewal units.</E> The number of renewal units assigned to the funding increment (as determined by HUD pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section); multiplied by</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjusted annual per unit cost.</E> The adjusted annual per unit cost (as determined by HUD pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Determining the number of renewal units</E>—(1) <E T="03">Number of renewal units.</E> HUD will determine the total number of renewal units for a PHA's program as of the last day of the calendar year previous to the calendar year for which renewal funding is calculated. The number of renewal units for a PHA's program will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Step 1: Establishing the initial baseline.</E> HUD will establish a baseline number of units (“baseline”) for each PHA program. The initial baseline equals the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHA program as of December 31, 1999.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Step 2: Establishing the adjusted baseline.</E> The adjusted baseline equals the initial baseline with the following adjustments from the initial baseline as of the last day of the calendar year previous to the calendar year for which renewal funding is calculated:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Additional units.</E> HUD will add to the initial baseline any additional units reserved for the PHA after December 31, 1999.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Units removed.</E> HUD will subtract from the initial baseline any units de-reserved by HUD from the PHA program after December 31, 1999.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Step 3: Determining the number of renewal units.</E> The number of renewal units equals the adjusted baseline minus the number of units supported by contract funding increments that expire after the end of the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Funding increments.</E> HUD will assign all units reserved for a PHA program to one or more funding increment(s).</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Correction of errors.</E> HUD may adjust the number of renewal units to correct errors.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determining the adjusted per unit cost.</E> HUD will determine the PHA's adjusted per unit cost when HUD processes the allocation of renewal funding for an expiring contract funding increment. The adjusted per unit cost calculated will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Step 1: Determining monthly program expenditure</E>—(i) <E T="03">Use of most recent HUD-approved year end statement.</E> HUD will determine the PHA's monthly per unit program expenditure for the HCV program (including project-based assistance under such program) under the consolidated ACC with HUD using data from the PHA's most recent HUD-approved year end statement.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Monthly program expenditure.</E> The monthly program expenditure equals:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Total program expenditure.</E> The PHA's total program expenditure (the total of housing assistance payments and administrative costs) for the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement; divided by</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Total unit months leased.</E> The total of unit months leased for the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Step 2: Determining annual per unit cost.</E> HUD will determine the PHA's annual per unit cost. The annual per unit <PRTPAGE P="511"/>cost equals the monthly program expenditures (as determined under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section) multiplied by 12.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Step 3: Determining adjusted annual per unit cost.</E> (i) HUD will determine the PHA's adjusted annual per unit cost. The adjusted annual per unit cost equals the annual per unit cost (as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section) multiplied cumulatively by the applicable published Section 8 housing assistance payments program annual adjustment factors in effect during the period from the end of the PHA fiscal year covered by the approved year end statement to the time when HUD processes the allocation of renewal funding.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Use of annual adjustment factor applicable to PHA jurisdiction.</E> For this purpose, HUD will use the annual adjustment factor from the notice published annually in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> pursuant to part 888 that is applicable to the jurisdiction of the PHA. For a PHA whose jurisdiction spans multiple annual adjustment factor areas, HUD will use the highest applicable annual adjustment factor.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Use of annual adjustment factors in effect subsequent to most recent Year End Statement.</E> HUD will use the Annual Adjustment Factors in effect during the time period subsequent to the time covered by the most recent HUD approved Year End Statement and the time of the processing of the contract funding increment to be renewed.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Special circumstances.</E> At its discretion, HUD may modify the adjusted annual per unit cost based on receipt of a modification request from a PHA. The modification request must demonstrate that because of special circumstances application of the annual adjustment factor will not provide an accurate adjusted annual per unit cost.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Correction of errors.</E> HUD may correct for errors in the adjusted per unit cost.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Consolidated ACC amendment to add renewal funding.</E> HUD will reserve allocated renewal funding available to the PHA within a reasonable time prior to the expiration of the funding increment to be renewed and establish a new expiration date one-year from the date of such expiration.</P>

              <P>(i) <E T="03">Reallocation of budget authority.</E> If a PHA has performance deficiencies, such as a failure to adequately lease units, HUD may reallocate some of its budget authority to other PHAs. If HUD determines to reallocate budget authority, it will reduce the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHA program of the PHA whose budget authority is being reallocated and increase the number of units reserved by HUD for the PHAs whose programs are receiving the benefit of the reallocation, so that such PHAs can issue vouchers. HUD will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> that will describe the circumstances and procedures for reallocating budget authority pursuant to this paragraph.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual contributions contract.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Nature of ACC.</E> (1) An annual contributions contract (ACC) is a written contract between HUD and a PHA. Under the ACC, HUD agrees to make payments to the PHA, over a specified term, for housing assistance payments to owners and for the PHA administrative fee. The ACC specifies the maximum payment over the ACC term. The PHA agrees to administer the program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.</P>

              <P>(2) HUD's commitment to make payments for each funding increment in the PHA program constitutes a separate ACC. However, commitments for all the funding increments in a PHA program are listed in one consolidated <PRTPAGE P="513"/>contractual document called the consolidated annual contributions contract (consolidated ACC). A single consolidated ACC covers funding for the PHA's HCV program. .</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Budget authority.</E> (1) Budget authority is the maximum amount that may be paid by HUD to a PHA over the ACC term of a funding increment. Before adding a funding increment to the consolidated ACC for a PHA program, HUD reserves budget authority from amounts authorized and appropriated by the Congress for the program.</P>
              <P>(2) For each funding increment, the ACC specifies the term over which HUD will make payments for the PHA program, and the amount of available budget authority for each funding increment. The amount to be paid to the PHA during each PHA fiscal year (including payment from the ACC reserve account described in § 982.154) must be approved by HUD.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Administrative fee.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purposes of administrative fee.</E> (1) HUD may approve administrative fees to the PHA for any of the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(i) Ongoing administrative fee;</P>
              <P>(ii) Costs to help families who experience difficulty finding or renting appropriate housing under the program;</P>
              <P>(iii) The following types of extraordinary costs approved by HUD:</P>
              <P>(A) Costs to cover necessary additional expenses incurred by the PHA to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title (e.g., additional counselling costs), where the PHA is unable to cover such additional expenses from ongoing administrative fee income or the PHA administrative fee reserve;</P>
              <P>(B) Costs of audit by an independent public accountant;</P>
              <P>(C) Other extraordinary costs determined necessary by HUD Headquarters;</P>
              <P>(iv) Preliminary fee (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section);</P>
              <P>(v) Costs to coordinate supportive services for families participating in the family self-sufficiency (FSS) program.</P>
              <P>(2) For each PHA fiscal year, administrative fees are specified in the PHA budget. The budget is submitted for HUD approval. Fees are paid in the amounts approved by HUD. Administrative fees may only be approved or paid from amounts appropriated by the Congress.</P>
              <P>(3) PHA administrative fees may only be used to cover costs incurred to perform PHA administrative responsibilities for the program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Ongoing administrative fee.</E> (1) The PHA ongoing administrative fee is paid for each program unit under HAP contract on the first day of the month. The amount of the ongoing fee is determined by HUD in accordance with Section 8(q)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(q)(1)).</P>
              <P>(2) If appropriations are available, HUD may pay a higher ongoing administrative fee for a small program or a program operating over a large geographic area. This higher fee level will not be approved unless the PHA demonstrates that it is efficiently administering its HCV program, and that the higher ongoing administrative fee is reasonable and necessary for administration of the program in accordance with HUD requirements.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD may pay a lower ongoing administrative fee for PHA-owned units.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Preliminary fee.</E> (1) If the PHA was not administering a program of Section 8 tenant-based assistance prior to the merger date, HUD will pay a one-time fee in the amount of $500 in the first year the PHA administers a program. The fee is paid for each new unit added to the PHA program by the initial funding increment under the consolidated ACC.</P>
              <P>(2) The preliminary fee is used to cover expenses the PHA incurs to help families who inquire about or apply for the program, and to lease up new program units.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Reducing PHA administrative fee.</E> HUD may reduce or offset any administrative fee to the PHA, in the amount determined by HUD, if the PHA fails to perform PHA administrative responsibilities correctly or adequately under <PRTPAGE P="514"/>the program (for example, PHA failure to enforce HQS requirements; or to reimburse a receiving PHA promptly under portability procedures).</P>

              <P>(b)(1) The PHA must use funds in the administrative fee reserve to pay program administrative expenses in excess of administrative fees paid by HUD for a PHA fiscal year. If funds in the administrative fee reserve are not needed to cover PHA administrative expenses (to the end of the last expiring funding increment under the consolidated ACC), the PHA may use these funds for other housing purposes permitted by State and local law. However, HUD may prohibit use of the funds for certain purposes.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA Board of Commissioners or other authorized officials must establish the maximum amount that may be charged against the administrative fee reserve without specific approval.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">When applicant is eligible: General.</E> The PHA may admit only eligible families to the program. To be eligible, an applicant must be a “family;” must be income-eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and 24 CFR part 5, subpart F; and must be a citizen or a noncitizen who has eligible immigration status as determined in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E. If the applicant is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies.<PRTPAGE P="517"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Income</E>—(1) <E T="03">Income-eligibility.</E> To be income-eligible, the applicant must be a family in any of the following categories:</P>
              <P>(i) A “very low income” family;</P>
              <P>(ii) A low-income family that is “continuously assisted” under the 1937 Housing Act;</P>
              <P>(iii) A low-income family that meets additional eligibility criteria specified in the PHA administrative plan. Such additional PHA criteria must be consistent with the PHA plan and with the consolidated plans for local governments in the PHA jurisdiction;</P>
              <P>(iv) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a HOPE 1 (HOPE for public housing homeownership) or HOPE 2 (HOPE for homeownership of multifamily units) project. (Section 8(o)(4)(D) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(4)(D));</P>
              <P>(v) A low-income or moderate-income family that is displaced as a result of the prepayment of the mortgage or voluntary termination of an insurance contract on eligible low-income housing as defined in § 248.101 of this title;</P>
              <P>(vi) A low-income family that qualifies for voucher assistance as a non-purchasing family residing in a project subject to a resident homeownership program under § 248.173 of this title.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Income-targeting.</E> (i) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's HCV program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low income families. Annual income of such families shall be verified within the period described in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) A PHA may admit a lower percent of extremely low income families during a PHA fiscal year (than otherwise required under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section) if HUD approves the use of such lower percent by the PHA, in accordance with the PHA plan, based on HUD's determination that the following circumstances necessitate use of such lower percent by the PHA:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA has opened its waiting list for a reasonable time for admission of extremely low income families residing in the same metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or non-metropolitan county, both inside and outside the PHA jurisdiction;</P>
              <P>(B) The PHA has provided full public notice of such opening to such families, and has conducted outreach and marketing to such families, including outreach and marketing to extremely low income families on the Section 8 and public housing waiting lists of other PHAs with jurisdiction in the same MSA or non-metropolitan county;</P>
              <P>(C) Notwithstanding such actions by the PHA (in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section), there are not enough extremely low income families on the PHA's waiting list to fill available slots in the program during any fiscal year for which use of a lower percent is approved by HUD; and</P>
              <P>(D) Admission of the additional very low income families other than extremely low income families to the PHA's tenant-based voucher program will substantially address worst case housing needs as determined by HUD.</P>
              <P>(iii) If approved by HUD, the admission of a portion of very low income welfare-to-work (WTW) families that are not extremely low income families may be disregarded in determining compliance with the PHA's income-targeting obligations under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. HUD will grant such approval only if and to the extent that the PHA has demonstrated to HUD's satisfaction that compliance with such targeting obligations with respect to such portion of WTW families would interfere with the objectives of the welfare-to-work voucher program. If HUD grants such approval, admission of that portion of WTW families is not counted in the base number of families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based voucher program during the fiscal year for purposes of income targeting.</P>
              <P>(iv) Admission of families as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) or (b)(1)(v) of this section is not subject to targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(v) If the jurisdictions of two or more PHAs that administer the HCV program cover an identical geographic area, such PHAs may elect to be treated as a single PHA for purposes of targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In such a case, the PHAs shall <PRTPAGE P="518"/>cooperate to assure that aggregate admissions by such PHAs comply with the targeting requirement. If such PHAs do not have a single fiscal year, HUD will determine which PHA's fiscal year is used for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(vi) If a family initially leases a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures at admission to the HCV program, such admission shall be counted against the targeting obligation of the initial PHA (unless the receiving PHA absorbs the portable family into the receiving PHA's HCV program from the point of admission).</P>
              <P>(3) The annual income (gross income) of an applicant family is used both for determination of income-eligibility under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and for targeting under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. In determining annual income of an applicant family that includes a person with disabilities, the determination must include the disallowance of increase in annual income as provided in 24 CFR 5.617, if applicable.</P>
              <P>(4) The applicable income limit for issuance of a voucher when a family is selected for the program is the highest income limit (for the family size) for areas in the PHA jurisdiction. The applicable income limit for admission to the program is the income limit for the area where the family is initially assisted in the program. At admission, the family may only use the voucher to rent a unit in an area where the family is income eligible.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Family composition.</E> See definition of “family” in 24 CFR 5.403.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Continuously assisted.</E> (1) An applicant is continuously assisted under the 1937 Housing Act if the family is already receiving assistance under any 1937 Housing Act program when the family is admitted to the voucher program.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must establish policies concerning whether and to what extent a brief interruption between assistance under one of these programs and admission to the voucher program will be considered to break continuity of assistance under the 1937 Housing Act.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">When PHA verifies that applicant is eligible.</E> The PHA must receive information verifying that an applicant is eligible within the period of 60 days before the PHA issues a voucher to the applicant.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Decision to deny assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice to applicant.</E> The PHA must give an applicant prompt written notice of a decision denying admission to the program (including a decision that the applicant is not eligible, or denying assistance for other reasons). The notice must give a brief statement of the reasons for the decision. The notice must also state that the applicant may request an informal review of the decision, and state how to arrange for the informal review.</P>
              <P>(2) For description of the grounds for denying assistance because of action or inaction by the applicant, see § 982.552(b) and (c) (requirement and authority to deny admission) and § 982.553(a) (crime by family members).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Waiting list: Local preferences in admission to program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Establishment of PHA local preferences.</E> (1) The PHA may establish a system of local preferences for selection of families admitted to the program. PHA selection preferences must be described in the PHA administrative plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA system of local preferences must be based on local housing needs and priorities, as determined by the PHA. In determining such needs and priorities, the PHA shall use generally accepted data sources. The PHA shall consider public comment on the proposed public housing agency plan (as received pursuant to § 903.17 of this chapter) and on the consolidated plan for the relevant jurisdiction (as received pursuant to part 91 of this title).</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA may limit the number of applicants that may qualify for any local preference.</P>
              <P>(4) The PHA shall not deny a local preference, nor otherwise exclude or penalize a family in admission to the program, solely because the family resides in a public housing project. The PHA may establish a preference for families residing in public housing who are victims of a crime of violence (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 16).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Particular local preferences</E>—(1) <E T="03">Residency requirements or preferences.</E> (i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although a PHA is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the PHA may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a) of this title.</P>
              <P>(ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”). A county or municipality may be used as a residency preference area. An area smaller than a county or municipality may not be used as a residency preference area.</P>

              <P>(iii) Any PHA residency preferences must be included in the statement of PHA policies that govern eligibility, selection and admission to the program, which is included in the PHA annual plan (or supporting documents) pursuant to part 903 of this title. Such policies must specify that use of a residency preference will not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to the program based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.<PRTPAGE P="522"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.</P>
              <P>(v) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The PHA may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Preference for working families.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families where the head, spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Preference for person with disabilities.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the PHA may not adopt a preference for admission of persons with a specific disability.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Preference for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</E> The PHA should consider whether to adopt a local preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities.</E> The PHA may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Selection among families with preference.</E> The PHA system of preferences may use either of the following to select among applicants on the waiting list with the same preference status:</P>
              <P>(1) Date and time of application; or</P>
              <P>(2) A drawing or other random choice technique.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preference for higher-income families.</E> The PHA must not select families for admission to the program in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting higher income families for admission to the program.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Verification of selection method.</E> The method for selecting applicants from a preference category must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that each applicant has been selected in accordance with the method specified in the administrative plan.</P>

              <P>(3) The briefing must also explain the advantages of areas that do not have a high concentration of low-income families.</P>

              <P>(4) In briefing a family that includes any disabled person, the PHA must <PRTPAGE P="523"/>take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication in accordance with 24 CFR 8.6.</P>
              <P>(5) In briefing a welfare-to-work family, the PHA must include specification of any local obligations of a welfare-to-work family and an explanation that failure to meet these obligations is grounds for PHA denial of admission or termination of assistance.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form of lease.</E> (1) The tenant and the owner must enter a written lease for the unit. The lease must be executed by the owner and the tenant.</P>
              <P>(2) If the owner uses a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants in the locality or the premises, the lease must be in such standard form (plus the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum). If the owner does not use a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants, the owner may use another form of lease, such as a PHA model lease (including the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum). The HAP contract prescribed by HUD will contain the owner's certification that if the owner uses a standard lease form for rental to unassisted tenants, the lease is in such standard form.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">State and local law.</E> The PHA may review the lease to determine if the lease complies with State and local law. The PHA may decline to approve the tenancy if the PHA determines that the lease does not comply with State or local law.</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Reasonable rent.</E> The rent to owner must be reasonable (see § 982.507).</P>

              <P>(i) The tenancy requirements for the program (in accordance with this section and §§ 982.309 and 982.310); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The composition of the household as approved by the PHA (family members and any PHA-approved live-in aide).</P>
              <P>(2) All provisions in the HUD-required tenancy addendum must be added word-for-word to the owner's standard form lease that is used by the owner for unassisted tenants. The tenant shall have the right to enforce the tenancy addendum against the owner, and the terms of the tenancy addendum shall prevail over any other provisions of the lease.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Changes in lease or rent.</E> (1) If the tenant and the owner agree to any changes in the lease, such changes must be in writing, and the owner must immediately give the PHA a copy of such changes. The lease, including any changes, must be in accordance with the requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) In the following cases, tenant-based assistance shall not be continued unless the PHA has approved a new tenancy in accordance with program requirements and has executed a new HAP contract with the owner:</P>
              <P>(i) If there are any changes in lease requirements governing tenant or owner responsibilities for utilities or appliances;</P>
              <P>(ii) If there are any changes in lease provisions governing the term of the lease;</P>
              <P>(iii) If the family moves to a new unit, even if the unit is in the same building or complex.</P>
              <P>(3) PHA approval of the tenancy, and execution of a new HAP contract, are not required for changes in the lease other than as specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) The owner must notify the PHA of any changes in the amount of the rent to owner at least sixty days before any such changes go into effect, and any such changes shall be subject to rent <PRTPAGE P="528"/>reasonableness requirements (see § 982.503).</P>

              <P>(2) The PHA failure to pay the housing assistance payment to the owner is not a violation of the lease between the tenant and the owner. During the term of the lease the owner may not terminate the tenancy of the family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Criminal activity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Evicting drug criminals due to drug crime on or near the premises.</E> The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in, on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, or such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for the owner to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that the owner may evict a family when the owner determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the owner determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Evicting other criminals.</E> (i) <E T="03">Threat to other residents.</E> The lease must provide that the owner may terminate tenancy for any of the following types of criminal activity by a covered person:</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Evidence of criminal activity.</E> The owner may terminate tenancy and evict by judicial action a family for criminal activity by a covered person in accordance with this section if the owner determines that the covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity and without satisfying the standard of proof used for a criminal conviction. (See part 5, subpart J, of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.)</P>

              <P>(iv) A business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (such as sale of the property, renovation of the unit, or desire to lease the unit at a higher rental).</P>
              <P>(2) During the initial lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause”, unless the owner is terminating the tenancy because of something the family did or failed to do. For example, during this period, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause” based on any of the following grounds: failure by the family to accept the offer of a new lease or revision; the owner's desire to use the unit for personal or family use, or for a purpose other than as a residential rental unit; or a business or economic reason for termination of the tenancy (see paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Owner notice</E>—(1) <E T="03">Notice of grounds.</E> (i) The owner must give the tenant a written notice that specifies the grounds for termination of tenancy during the term of the lease. The tenancy does not terminate before the owner has given this notice, and the notice must be given at or before commencement of the eviction action.</P>
              <P>(ii) The notice of grounds may be included in, or may be combined with, any owner eviction notice to the tenant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Eviction notice.</E> (i) Owner eviction notice means a notice to vacate, or a complaint or other initial pleading used under State or local law to commence an eviction action.</P>

The owner may consider all of the circumstances relevant to a particular eviction case, such as:</P>
              <P>(i) The seriousness of the offending action;<PRTPAGE P="530"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) The effect on the community of denial or termination or the failure of the owner to take such action;</P>

              <P>(vii) The effect of the owner's action on the integrity of the program.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Exclusion of culpable household member.</E> The owner may require a tenant to exclude a household member in order to continue to reside in the assisted unit, where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants termination.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Consideration of rehabilitation.</E> In determining whether to terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, the owner may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, the owner may require the tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Nondiscrimination limitation and protection for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.</E> The owner's termination of tenancy actions must be consistent with the fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of 24 CFR 5.105, and with the provisions for protection of victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Termination of payment: When owner terminates the lease.</E> Housing assistance payments terminate when the lease is terminated by the owner in accordance with the lease. However, if the owner has commenced the process to evict the tenant, and if the family continues to reside in the unit, the PHA must continue to make housing assistance payments to the owner in accordance with the HAP contract until the owner has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant. The PHA may continue such payments until the family moves from or is evicted from the unit.</P>

              <P>(2) If a participant family moves from an assisted unit with continued tenant-based assistance, the term of the assisted lease for the new assisted unit may begin during the month the family moves out of the first assisted unit. Overlap of the last housing assistance payment (for the month when the family moves out of the old unit) and <PRTPAGE P="531"/>the first assistance payment for the new unit, is not considered to constitute a duplicative housing subsidy.</P>

The family must cooperate with the PHA for this purpose. The family must promptly notify the PHA of absence from the unit, including any information requested on the purposes of family absences.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA may adopt appropriate techniques to verify family occupancy or absence, including letters to the family at the unit, phone calls, visits or questions to the landlord or neighbors.</P>
              <P>(e) The PHA administrative plan must state the PHA policies on family absence from the dwelling unit. The PHA absence policy includes:</P>

              <P>(i) The PHA must inform the family, both orally and in writing, that the family has the right to select any eligible unit available for lease, and a PHA-owned unit is freely selected by the family, without PHA pressure or steering.</P>
              <P>(ii) The unit is not ineligible housing.</P>

              <P>(B) The independent agency used to perform these functions must be approved by HUD. The independent agency may be the unit of general local government for the PHA jurisdiction (unless the PHA is itself the unit of general local government or an agency of such government), or may be another HUD-approved independent agency.</P>
              <P>(C) The PHA may compensate the independent agency from PHA ongoing administrative fee income for the services performed by the independent agency.

              <SUBJECT>Where family can lease a unit with tenant-based assistance.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Assistance in the initial PHA jurisdiction.</E> The family may receive tenant-based assistance to lease a unit located anywhere in the jurisdiction (as determined by State and local law) of the initial PHA. HUD may nevertheless restrict the family's right to lease such a unit anywhere in such jurisdiction if HUD determines that limitations on a family's opportunity to select among available units in that jurisdiction are appropriate to achieve desegregation goals in accordance with obligations generated by a court order or consent decree.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Portability: Assistance outside the initial PHA jurisdiction.</E> Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, and to § 982.552 and § 982.553, a voucher-holder or participant family has the right to receive tenant-based voucher assistance, in accordance with requirements of this part, to lease a unit outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, anywhere in the United States, in the jurisdiction of a PHA with a tenant-based program under this part. The initial PHA must not provide such portable assistance for a participant if the family has moved out of the assisted unit in violation of the lease except as provided for in this subsection. If the family moves out in violation of the lease in order to protect the health or safety of a person who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believes him- or herself to be threatened with imminent harm from further violence by remaining in the dwelling unit (or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move), and has otherwise complied with all other obligations under the Section 8 program, the family may receive a voucher from the initial PHA and move to another jurisdiction under the Housing Choice Voucher Program.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nonresident applicants.</E> (1) This paragraph (c) applies if neither the household head nor spouse of an assisted family already had a “domicile” (legal residence) in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA at the time when the family first submitted an application for participation in the program to the initial PHA.</P>
              <P>(2) The following apply during the 12 month period from the time when a family described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is admitted to the program:</P>
              <P>(i) The family may lease a unit anywhere in the jurisdiction of the initial PHA;</P>
              <P>(ii) The family does not have any right to portability;</P>
              <P>(iii) The initial PHA may choose to allow portability during this period.</P>
              <P>(3) If the initial PHA approves, the family may lease a unit outside the PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures.</P>
              <P>(4) Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member who has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Income eligibility.</E> (1) For admission to the program, a family must be income eligible in the area where the family initially leases a unit with assistance under the program.</P>
              <P>(2) If a family is a participant in the initial PHA's voucher program, income eligibility is not redetermined when the family moves to the receiving PHA program under portability procedures.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Freedom of choice.</E> The PHA may not directly or indirectly reduce the family's opportunity to select among available units, except as provided in <PRTPAGE P="535"/>paragraph (a) of this section, or elsewhere in this part 982 (e.g., prohibition on the use of ineligible housing, housing not meeting HQS, or housing for which the rent to owner exceeds a reasonable rent). However, the PHA must provide families the information required in § 982.301 for both the oral briefing and the information packet to ensure that they have the information they need to make an informed decision on their housing choice.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This section states when a participant family may move to a new unit with continued tenant-based assistance:</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When family may move.</E> A family may move to a new unit if:</P>
              <P>(1) The assisted lease for the old unit has terminated. This includes a termination because:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA has terminated the HAP contract for the owner's breach; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The lease has terminated by mutual agreement of the owner and the tenant.</P>
              <P>(2) The owner has given the tenant a notice to vacate, or has commenced an action to evict the tenant, or has obtained a court judgment or other process allowing the owner to evict the tenant.</P>
              <P>(3) The tenant has given notice of lease termination (if the tenant has a right to terminate the lease on notice to the owner, for owner breach, or otherwise).</P>
              <P>(4) The family or a member of the family, is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or if any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move. A PHA may not terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, moves out of a unit in violation of the lease, if such move occurs to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit. However, any family member that has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's move or request to move is not required to believe that he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">How many moves.</E> (1) A participant family may move with continued assistance under the program, either inside the PHA jurisdiction, or under the portability procedures (See § 982.353) in accordance with the PHA's policies.</P>
              <P>(2) Consistent with applicable civil rights laws and regulations, the PHA may establish policies that:</P>
              <P>(i) Prohibit any move by the family during the initial lease term;</P>
              <P>(ii) Prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The above policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice that family wants to move.</E> If the family wants to move to a new unit, the family must notify the PHA and the owner before moving from the old unit. If the family wants to move to a new unit that is located outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the notice to the initial PHA must specify the area where the family wants to move.

              <SUBJECT>Portability: Administration by initial and receiving PHA.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> When a family moves under portability (in accordance with § 982.353(b)) to an area outside the initial PHA jurisdiction, the receiving PHA must administer assistance for the family if a PHA with a HCV program has jurisdiction in the area where the unit is located.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirement to administer assistance.</E> A receiving PHA cannot refuse to assist incoming portable families or direct them to another neighboring PHA for assistance. If there is more than one such PHA, the initial PHA provides the family with the contact information for the receiving PHAs that serve the area, and the family selects the receiving PHA. The family must inform the initial PHA which PHA it has selected as the receiving PHA. In cases where the family prefers not to select the receiving PHA, the initial PHA selects the receiving PHA on behalf of the family. HUD may determine in certain instances that a PHA is not required to accept incoming portable families, such as a PHA in a declared disaster area. However, the PHA must have approval in writing from HUD before refusing any incoming portable families.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Portability procedures.</E> The following portability procedures must be followed:</P>
              <P>(1) When the family decides to use the voucher outside of the PHA jurisdiction, the family must notify the initial PHA of its desire to relocate and must specify the location where it wants to live.</P>
              <P>(2) The initial PHA must determine the family's eligibility to move in accordance with §§ 982.353 and 982.354.</P>
              <P>(3) Once the receiving PHA is determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the initial PHA must contact the receiving PHA, via email or other confirmed delivery method, prior to approving the family's request to move in order to determine whether the voucher will be absorbed or billed by the receiving PHA. The receiving PHA must advise the initial PHA in writing, via email or other confirmed delivery method, of its decision.</P>
              <P>(4) If the receiving PHA notifies the initial PHA that it will absorb the voucher, the receiving PHA cannot reverse its decision at a later date without consent of the initial PHA.</P>
              <P>(5) If the receiving PHA will bill the initial PHA for the portability voucher and the cost of the HAP will increase due to the move, the initial PHA may deny the move if it does not have sufficient funding for continued assistance in accordance with § 982.354 (e)(1).</P>
              <P>(6) If a billing arrangement is approved by the initial PHA or if the voucher is to be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA must issue the family a voucher to move, if it has not already done so, and advise the family how to contact and request assistance from the receiving PHA.</P>
              <P>(7) The initial PHA must promptly notify the receiving PHA to expect the family. The initial PHA must give the receiving PHA the form HUD-52665, the most recent form HUD 50058 (Family Report) for the family, and all related verification information.</P>
              <P>(8) The family must promptly contact the receiving PHA in order to be informed of the receiving PHA's procedures for incoming portable families and comply with these procedures. The family's failure to comply may result in denial or termination of the receiving PHA's voucher.</P>

              <P>(9) The receiving PHA does not redetermine eligibility for a participant family. However, for a family that was not already receiving assistance in the PHA's HCV program, the initial PHA must determine whether the family is eligible for admission to the receiving <PRTPAGE P="537"/>PHA's HCV program. In determining income eligibility, the receiving PHA's income limits are used by the initial PHA.</P>
              <P>(10) When a receiving PHA assists a family under portability, administration of the voucher must be in accordance with the receiving PHA's policies. This requirement also applies to policies of Moving to Work agencies. The receiving PHA procedures and preferences for selection among eligible applicants do not apply to the family, and the receiving PHA waiting list is not used.</P>
              <P>(11) If the receiving PHA opts to conduct a new reexamination for a current participant family, the receiving PHA may not delay issuing the family a voucher or otherwise delay approval of a unit.</P>
              <P>(12) The receiving PHA must determine the family unit size for the family, and base its determination on the subsidy standards of the receiving PHA.</P>
              <P>(13) The receiving PHA must issue a voucher to the family. The term of the receiving PHA voucher may not expire before 30 calendar days from the expiration date of the initial PHA voucher. If the voucher expires before the family arrives at the receiving PHA, the receiving PHA must contact the initial PHA to determine if it will extend the voucher.</P>
              <P>(14) Once the receiving PHA issues the portable family a voucher, the receiving PHA's policies on extensions of the voucher term apply. The receiving PHA must notify the initial PHA of any extensions granted to the term of the voucher.</P>
              <P>(15) The family must submit a request for tenancy approval to the receiving PHA during the term of the receiving PHA voucher. As required in § 982.303, if the family submits a request for tenancy approval during the term of the voucher, the PHA must suspend the term of that voucher.</P>
              <P>(16) The receiving PHA must promptly notify the initial PHA if the family has leased an eligible unit under the program, or if the family fails to submit a request for tenancy approval for an eligible unit within the term of the voucher.</P>
              <P>(17) At any time, either the initial PHA or the receiving PHA may make a determination to deny or terminate assistance to the family in accordance with § 982.552 and 982.553.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Absorption by the receiving PHA.</E> (1) If funding is available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program, the receiving PHA may absorb the family into the receiving PHA's HCV program. After absorption, the family is assisted with funds available under the consolidated ACC for the receiving PHA's HCV program.</P>

              <P>(2) HUD may require that the receiving PHA absorb all, or a portion of, incoming portable families. Under circumstances described in a notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> HUD may determine that receiving PHAs, or categories of receiving PHAs, should absorb all or a portion of incoming portable families. If HUD makes such a determination, HUD will provide an opportunity for public comment, for a period of no less than 60 calendar days, on such policy and procedures. After consideration of public comments, HUD will publish a final notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> advising PHAs and the public of HUD's final determination on the subject of mandatory absorption of incoming portable families.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD may provide financial or nonfinancial incentives (or both) to PHAs that absorb portability vouchers.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Portability billing.</E> (1) To cover assistance for a portable family that was not absorbed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the receiving PHA may bill the initial PHA for housing assistance payments and administrative fees.</P>
              <P>(2) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the full amount of the housing assistance payments made by the receiving PHA for the portable family. The amount of the housing assistance payment for a portable family in the receiving PHA program is determined in the same manner as for other families in the receiving PHA program.</P>

              <P>(3) The initial PHA must promptly reimburse the receiving PHA for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's ongoing administrative fee for each program unit <PRTPAGE P="538"/>under HAP contract on the first day of the month for which the receiving PHA is billing the initial PHA under this section. If administrative fees are prorated for the HCV program, the proration will apply to the amount of the administrative fee for which the receiving PHA may bill under this section (e.g., the receiving PHA may bill for the lesser of 80 percent of the initial PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee or 100 percent of the receiving PHA's prorated ongoing administrative fee). If both PHAs agree, the PHAs may negotiate a different amount of reimbursement.</P>
              <P>(4) When a portable family moves out of the HCV program of a receiving PHA that has not absorbed the family, the PHA in the new jurisdiction to which the family moves becomes the receiving PHA, and the first receiving PHA is no longer required to provide assistance for the family.</P>
              <P>(5) In administration of portability, the initial PHA and the receiving PHA must comply with financial procedures required by HUD, including the use of HUD-required billing forms. The initial and receiving PHA must also comply with billing and payment deadlines under the financial procedures.</P>
              <P>(6) A PHA must manage the PHA HCV program in a manner that ensures that the PHA has the financial ability to provide assistance for families that move out of the PHA's program under the portability procedures, and that have not been absorbed by the receiving PHA, as well as for families that remain in the PHA's program.</P>
              <P>(7) HUD may reduce the administrative fee to an initial or receiving PHA if the PHA does not comply with HUD portability requirements.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Portability funding.</E> (1) HUD may transfer units and funds for assistance to portable families to the receiving PHA from funds available under the initial PHA ACC.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the initial PHA for funds transferred to a receiving PHA for portability purposes.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD may provide additional funding (e.g., funds for incremental units) to the receiving PHA for absorption of portable families.</P>
              <P>(4) HUD may require the receiving PHA to absorb portable families.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Special purpose vouchers.</E> (1) The initial PHA must submit the codes used for special purpose vouchers on the form HUD-50058, Family Report, and the receiving PHA must maintain the codes on the Family Report, as long as the Receiving PHA chooses to bill the initial PHA.</P>
              <P>(2) Initial and receiving PHAs must administer special purpose vouchers, such as the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing vouchers, in accordance with HUD-established policy in cases where HUD has established alternative program requirements of such special purpose vouchers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Subsidy standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) The PHA must establish subsidy standards that determine the number of bedrooms needed for families of different sizes and compositions.</P>
              <P>(2) For each family, the PHA determines the appropriate number of bedrooms under the PHA subsidy standards (family unit size).</P>
              <P>(3) The family unit size number is entered on the voucher issued to the family. The PHA issues the family a voucher for the family unit size when a family is selected for participation in the program.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Determining family unit size.</E> The following requirements apply when the PHA determines family unit size under the PHA subsidy standards:</P>
              <P>(1) The subsidy standards must provide for the smallest number of bedrooms needed to house a family without overcrowding.</P>
              <P>(2) The subsidy standards must be consistent with space requirements under the housing quality standards (See § 982.401(d)).</P>
              <P>(3) The subsidy standards must be applied consistently for all families of like size and composition.</P>
              <P>(4) A child who is temporarily away from the home because of placement in foster care is considered a member of the family in determining the family unit size.</P>

              <P>(5) A family that consists of a pregnant woman (with no other persons) must be treated as a two-person family.<PRTPAGE P="542"/>
              </P>
              <P>(6) Any live-in aide (approved by the PHA to reside in the unit to care for a family member who is disabled or is at least 50 years of age) must be counted in determining the family unit size;</P>
              <P>(7) Unless a live-in-aide resides with the family, the family unit size for any family consisting of a single person must be either a zero or one-bedroom unit, as determined under the PHA subsidy standards.</P>
              <P>(8) In determining family unit size for a particular family, the PHA may grant an exception to its established subsidy standards if the PHA determines that the exception is justified by the age, sex, health, handicap, or relationship of family members or other personal circumstances. (For a single person other than a disabled or elderly person or remaining family member, such PHA exception may not override the limitation in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of family unit size-maximum subsidy in voucher program.</E> The family unit size as determined for a family under the PHA subsidy standard is used to determine the maximum rent subsidy for a family assisted in the voucher program. For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standard for a family shall be the lower of:</P>
              <P>(1) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or</P>
              <P>(2) The payment standard amount for the unit size of the unit rented by the family.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Voucher program.</E> For a voucher tenancy, the PHA establishes payment standards by number of bedrooms. The payment standards for the family must be the lower of:</P>
              <P>(i) The payment standards for the family unit size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The payment standard for the unit size rented by the family.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Size of unit occupied by family.</E> (1) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with fewer bedrooms than the family unit size. However, the dwelling unit must meet the applicable HQS space requirements.</P>
              <P>(2) The family may lease an otherwise acceptable dwelling unit with more bedrooms than the family unit size. However, utility allowances must follow § 982.517(d).</P>

              <SUBJECT>PHA initial and periodic unit inspection.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The PHA must inspect the unit leased to a family prior to the initial term of the lease, at least biennially during assisted occupancy, and at other times as needed, to determine if the unit meets the HQS. (See § 982.305(b)(2) concerning timing of initial inspection by the PHA.)</P>
              <P>(b) The PHA must conduct supervisory quality control HQS inspections.</P>
              <P>(c) In scheduling inspections, the PHA must consider complaints and any other information brought to the attention of the PHA.</P>
              <P>(d) The PHA must notify the owner of defects shown by the inspection.</P>
              <P>(e) The PHA may not charge the family for an initial inspection or reinspection of the unit.</P>
              <P>(f) The PHA may not charge the owner for the inspection of the unit prior to the initial term of the lease or for a first inspection during assisted occupancy of the unit. The PHA may establish a reasonable fee to owners for a reinspection if an owner notifies the PHA that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible for repairing pursuant to § 982.404(a) was not corrected. The owner may not pass this fee along to the family. Fees collected under this paragraph will be included in a PHA's administrative fee reserve and may be used only for activities related to the provision of Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance.</P>

              <P>(g) If a participant family or government official reports a condition that is life-threatening (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 24 hours in accordance with § 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the housing unit within 24 hours of when the PHA received the notification. If the reported condition is not life-threatening (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 30 calendar days in accordance with § 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the unit within 15 days of when the PHA received the notification. In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a Presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may waive the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of alternative inspections.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) A PHA may comply with the inspection requirement in § 982.405(a) by relying on an alternative inspection (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> an inspection conducted for another housing assistance program) only if the PHA is able to obtain the results of the alternative inspection.</P>
              <P>(2) If an alternative inspection method employs sampling, then a PHA may rely on such alternative inspection method to comply with the requirement in § 982.405(a) only if HCV units are included in the population of units forming the basis of the sample.</P>
              <P>(3) Units in properties that are mixed-finance properties assisted with project-based vouchers may be inspected at least triennially pursuant to 24 CFR 983.103(g).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Administrative plans.</E> A PHA relying on an alternative inspection to fulfill the requirement in § 982.405(a) must identify the alternative inspection method being used in the PHA's administrative plan. Such a change may be a significant amendment to the plan, in which case the PHA must follow its plan amendment and public notice requirements, in addition to meeting the requirements in § 982.406(c)(2), if applicable, before using the alternative inspection method.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Eligible inspection methods.</E> (1) A PHA may rely upon inspections of housing assisted under the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program or housing financed using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), or inspections performed by HUD, with no action other than amending its administrative plan.</P>
              <P>(2) If a PHA wishes to rely on an inspection method other than a method listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then, prior to amending its administrative plan, the PHA must submit to the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) a copy of the inspection method it wishes to use, along with its analysis of the inspection method that shows that the method “provides the same or greater protection to occupants of dwelling units” as would HQS.</P>
              <P>(i) A PHA may rely upon such alternative inspection method only upon receiving approval from REAC to do so.</P>
              <P>(ii) A PHA that uses an alternative inspection method approved under this paragraph must monitor changes to the standards and requirements applicable to such method. If any change is made to the alternative inspection method, then the PHA must submit to REAC a copy of the revised standards and requirements, along with a revised comparison to HQS. If the PHA or REAC determines that the revision would cause the alternative inspection to no longer meet or exceed HQS, then the PHA may no longer rely upon the alternative inspection method to comply with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Results of alternative inspection.</E> (1) In order for a PHA to rely upon the results of an alternative inspection to comply with the requirement at § 982.405(a), a property inspected pursuant to such method must meet the standards or requirements regarding housing quality or safety applicable to properties assisted under the program using the alternative inspection method. To make the determination of whether such standards or requirements are met, the PHA must adhere to the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(i) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “pass” score, then the PHA may rely on that inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).</P>
              <P>(ii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “fail” score, then the PHA may not rely on that inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).</P>

              <P>(iii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method that does not employ a pass/fail determination—for example, in the case of a program where deficiencies are simply identified—then the PHA must review the list of deficiencies to determine whether any cited deficiency would have resulted in a “fail” score under HQS. If no such deficiency exists, then the PHA may rely on the inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a); if such a deficiency does exist, then the <PRTPAGE P="545"/>PHA may not rely on the inspection to demonstrate such compliance.</P>
              <P>(2) Under any circumstance described above in which a PHA is prohibited from relying on an alternative inspection method for a property, the PHA must, within a reasonable period of time, conduct an HQS inspection of any units in the property occupied by voucher program participants and follow HQS procedures to remedy any identified deficiencies.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Records retention.</E> As with all other inspection reports, and as required by § 982.158(f)(4), reports for inspections conducted pursuant to an alternative inspection method must be obtained by the PHA. Such reports must be available for HUD inspection for at least three years from the date of the latest inspection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Payment standard amount and schedule.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment standard schedule.</E> (1) HUD publishes the fair market rents for each market area in the United States (see part 888 of this title). The PHA must adopt a payment standard schedule that establishes voucher payment standard amounts for each FMR area in the PHA jurisdiction. For each FMR area, the PHA must establish payment standard amounts for each “unit size.” Unit size is measured by number of bedrooms (zero-bedroom, one-bedroom, and so on).</P>
              <P>(2) The payment standard amounts on the PHA schedule are used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family (§ 982.505).</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA voucher payment standard schedule shall establish a single payment standard amount for each unit size. For each unit size, the PHA may establish a single payment standard amount for the whole FMR area, or may establish a separate payment standard amount for each designated part of the FMR area.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Establishing payment standard amounts.</E> (1)(i) The PHA may establish the payment standard amount for a unit size at any level between 90 percent and 110 percent of the published FMR for that unit size. HUD approval is not required to establish a payment standard amount in that range (“basic range”). The PHA must revise the payment standard amount no later than 3 months following the effective date of the published FMR if a change is necessary to stay within the basic range.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may establish a separate payment standard amount within the basic range for a designated part of an FMR area.</P>

              <P>(iii) A PHA that is not in a designated Small Area FMR area or has not opted to voluntarily implement Small Area FMRs under 24 CFR 888.113(c)(3) may establish exception payment standards for a ZIP code area above the basic range for the metropolitan FMR based on the HUD published Small Area FMRs. The PHA may establish an exception payment standard up to 110 percent of the HUD published Small Area FMR for that ZIP code area. The PHA must notify HUD if it establishes an exception payment <PRTPAGE P="548"/>standard based on the Small Area FMR. The exception payment standard must apply to the entire ZIP code area.</P>

              <P>(iv) At the request of a PHA administering the HCV program under Small Area FMRs under § 888.113(c)(3), HUD may approve an exception payment standard for a Small Area FMR area above the 110 percent of the published FMR in accordance with conditions set forth by Notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to these exception payment standard requests and approvals.</P>
              <P>(v) The PHA may establish an exception payment standard of not more than 120 percent of the published FMR if required as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 for a family that includes a person with a disability. Any unit approved under an exception payment standard must still meet the reasonable rent requirements found at § 982.507.</P>
              <P>(vi) The PHA may establish an exception payment standard of more than 120 percent of the published FMR if required as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 for a family that includes a person with a disability after approval from HUD. Any unit approved under an exception payment standard must still meet the reasonable rent requirements found at § 982.507.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) through (v) of this section, the PHA must request HUD approval to establish a payment standard amount that is higher or lower than the basic range. HUD has sole discretion to grant or deny approval of a higher or lower payment standard amount. Paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section describe the requirements for approval of a higher payment standard amount (“exception payment standard amount”).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">HUD approval of exception payment standard amount</E>—(1) <E T="03">HUD discretion.</E> At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve a payment standard amount that is higher than the basic range for a designated part of the fair market rent area (called an “exception area”). HUD may approve an exception payment standard amount in accordance with this paragraph (c) of this section for all units, or for all units of a given unit size, leased by program families in the exception area. Any PHA with jurisdiction in the exception area may use the HUD-approved exception payment standard amount.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Above 110 percent of FMR to 120 percent of published FMR.</E> The HUD Field Office may approve an exception payment standard amount from above 110 percent of the published FMR to 120 percent of the published FMR (upper range) if the HUD Field Office determines that approval is justified by the median rent method or the 40th percentile rent or the Small Area FMR method as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (and that such approval is also supported by an appropriate program justification in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section).</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Median rent method.</E> In the median rent method, HUD determines the exception payment standard amount by multiplying the FMR times a fraction of which the numerator is the median gross rent of the exception area and the denominator is the median gross rent of the entire FMR area. In this method, HUD uses median gross rent data from the most recent decennial United States census, and the exception area may be any geographic entity within the FMR area (or any combination of such entities) for which median gross rent data is provided in decennial census products.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">40th percentile rent or Small Area FMR method.</E> In this method, HUD determines that the area exception payment standard amount equals application of the 40th percentile of rents for standard quality rental housing in the exception area or the Small Area FMR. HUD determines whether the 40th percentile rent or Small Area FMR applies in accordance with the methodology described in 24 CFR 888.113 for determining FMRs. A PHA must present statistically representative rental housing survey data to justify HUD approval.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Above 120 percent of FMR.</E> (i) At the request of a PHA, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing may approve an exception payment standard amount for the total area of a county, PHA jurisdiction, or place if <PRTPAGE P="549"/>the Assistant Secretary determines that:</P>
              <P>(A) Such approval is necessary to prevent financial hardship for families;</P>
              <P>(B) Such approval is supported by statistically representative rental housing survey data to justify HUD approval in accordance with the methodology described in § 888.113 of this title; and</P>
              <P>(C) Such approval is also supported by an appropriate program justification in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the term “place” is an incorporated place or a U.S. Census designated place. An incorporated place is established by State law and includes cities, boroughs, towns, and villages. A U.S. Census designated place is the statistical counterpart of an incorporated place.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Program justification.</E> (i) HUD will only approve an exception payment standard amount (pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or paragraph (c)(3) of this section) if HUD determines that approval of such higher amount is needed either:</P>
              <P>(A) To help families find housing outside areas of high poverty, or</P>
              <P>(B) Because voucher holders have trouble finding housing for lease under the program within the term of the voucher.</P>
              <P>(ii) HUD will only approve an exception payment standard amount (pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section) after six months from the date of HUD approval of an exception payment standard pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the area.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Population.</E> The total population of HUD-approved exception areas in an FMR area may not include more than 50 percent of the population of the FMR area, except when applying Small Area FMR exception areas under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Withdrawal or modification.</E> At any time, HUD may withdraw or modify approval to use an exception payment standard amount.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">HUD approval of payment standard amount below the basic range.</E> HUD may consider a PHA request for approval to establish a payment standard amount that is lower than the basic range. At HUD's sole discretion, HUD may approve PHA establishment of a payment standard lower than the basic range. In determining whether to approve the PHA request, HUD will consider appropriate factors, including rent burden of families assisted under the program. HUD will not approve a lower payment standard if the family share for more than 40 percent of participants in the PHA's voucher program exceeds 30 percent of adjusted monthly income. Such determination may be based on the most recent examinations of family income.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">HUD approval of success rate payment standard amounts.</E> In order to increase the number of voucher holders who become participants, HUD may approve requests from PHAs whose FMRs are computed at the 40th percentile rent to establish higher, success rate payment standard amounts. A success rate payment standard amount is defined as any amount between 90 percent and 110 percent of the 50th percentile rent, calculated in accordance with the methodology described in § 888.113 of this title.</P>
              <P>(1) A PHA may obtain HUD Field Office approval of success rate payment standard amounts provided the PHA demonstrates to HUD that it meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Fewer than 75 percent of the families to whom the PHA issued rental vouchers during the most recent 6 month period for which there is success rate data available have become participants in the voucher program;</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA has established payment standard amounts for all unit sizes in the entire PHA jurisdiction within the FMR area at 110 percent of the published FMR for at least the 6 month period referenced in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section and up to the time the request is made to HUD; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA has a policy of granting automatic extensions of voucher terms to at least 90 days to provide a family who has made sustained efforts to locate suitable housing with additional search time.</P>

              <P>(2) In determining whether to approve the PHA request to establish success rate payment standard amounts, HUD will consider whether the PHA <PRTPAGE P="550"/>has a SEMAP overall performance rating of “troubled”. If a PHA does not yet have a SEMAP rating, HUD will consider the PHA's SEMAP certification.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD approval of success rate payment standard amounts shall be for all unit sizes in the FMR area. A PHA may opt to establish a success rate payment standard amount for one or more unit sizes in all or a designated part of the PHA jurisdiction within the FMR area.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Payment standard protection for PHAs that meet deconcentration objectives.</E> Paragraph (f) of this section applies only to a PHA with jurisdiction in an FMR area where the FMR had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent to provide a broad range of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area, pursuant to § 888.113(i)(3), but is now set at the 40th percentile rent.</P>
              <P>(1) Such a PHA may obtain HUD Field Office approval of a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent if the PHA scored the maximum number of points on the deconcentration bonus indicator in § 985.3(h) in the prior year, or in two of the last three years.</P>
              <P>(2) HUD approval of payment standard amounts based on the 50th percentile rent shall be for all unit sizes in the FMR area that had previously been set at the 50th percentile rent pursuant to § 888.113(i)(3). A PHA may opt to establish a payment standard amount based on the 50th percentile rent for one or more unit sizes in all or a designated part of the PHA jurisdiction within the FMR area.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">HUD review of PHA payment standard schedules.</E> (1) HUD will monitor rent burdens of families assisted in a PHA's voucher program. HUD will review the PHA's payment standard for a particular unit size if HUD finds that 40 percent or more of such families occupying units of that unit size currently pay more than 30 percent of adjusted monthly income as the family share. Such determination may be based on the most recent examinations of family income.</P>
              <P>(2) After such review, HUD may, at its discretion, require the PHA to modify payment standard amounts for any unit size on the PHA payment standard schedule. HUD may require the PHA to establish an increased payment standard amount within the basic range.</P>

              <P>(a) This section applies to HCV assistance if all the following conditions are applicable:</P>
              <P>(1) Such HCV assistance is provided to a family pursuant to 24 CFR 401.421 when HUD has approved a restructuring plan, and the participating administrative entity has approved the use of tenant-based assistance to provide continued assistance for such families. Such tenant-based voucher assistance is provided for a family previously receiving project-based assistance in an eligible project (as defined in § 401.2 of this title) at the time when the project-based assistance terminates.</P>
              <P>(2) The family chooses to remain in the restructured project with HCV assistance under the program and leases a unit that does not exceed the family unit size;</P>
              <P>(3) The lease for such assisted tenancy commences during the first year after the project-based assistance terminates.</P>
              <P>(b) The initial payment standard for the family under such initial lease is the sum of the reasonable rent to owner for the unit plus the utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. (Determination of such initial payment standard for the family is not subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of § 982.505. Except for determination of the initial payment standard as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment standard and housing assistance payment for the family during the HAP contract term shall be determined in accordance with § 982.505.)</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Use of payment standard.</E> A payment standard is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family. The “payment standard” is the maximum monthly subsidy payment.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount of monthly housing assistance payment.</E> The PHA shall pay a monthly housing assistance payment on behalf of the family that is equal to the <E T="03">lower</E> of:</P>
              <P>(1) The payment standard for the family minus the total tenant payment; or</P>
              <P>(2) The gross rent minus the total tenant payment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment standard for family.</E> (1) The payment standard for the family is the lower of:</P>
              <P>(i) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The payment standard amount for the size of the dwelling unit rented by the family.</P>
              <P>(2) If the PHA has established a separate payment standard amount for a designated part of an FMR area in accordance with § 982.503 (including an exception payment standard amount as determined in accordance with § 982.503(b)(2) and § 982.503(c)), and the dwelling unit is located in such designated part, the PHA must use the appropriate payment standard amount for such designated part to calculate the payment standard for the family. The payment standard for the family shall be calculated in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Decrease in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.</E> If the amount on the payment standard schedule is decreased during the term of the HAP contract, the PHA is not required to reduce the payment standard amount used to calculate the subsidy for the families under HAP contract for as long as the HAP contract remains in effect.</P>
              <P>(i) If the PHA chooses to reduce the payment standard for the families currently under HAP contract during the HAP contract term in accordance with their administrative plan, the initial reduction to the payment standard amount used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family may not be applied any earlier than the effective date of the family's second regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in the payment standard amount.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may choose to reduce the payment standard amount for families that remain under HAP contract to the current payment standard amount in effect on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule, or may reduce the payment standard amount to an amount that is higher than the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule. The PHA may further reduce the payment standard amount for the families during the term of the HAP contract, provided the subsequent reductions continue to result in a payment standard amount that meets or exceeds the normally applicable payment standard amount on the PHA voucher payment standard schedule.</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA must provide the family with at least 12 months' notice that the payment standard is being reduced during the term of the HAP contract before the effective date of the change.</P>

              <P>(iv) The PHA shall administer decreases in the payment standard amount during the term of the HAP contract in accordance with the PHA policy as described in the PHA administrative plan. The PHA may establish different policies for designated areas within their jurisdiction (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> for different zip code areas), but the PHA administrative policy on decreases to payment standards during the term of the HAP contract applies to all families under HAP contract at the time of the effective date of decrease in the payment standard within that designated area. The PHA may not limit or otherwise establish different protections or policies for certain families under HAP contract.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Increase in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.</E> If the payment standard amount is increased during the term of the HAP contract, the increased payment standard amount shall be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the <PRTPAGE P="552"/>effective date of the family's first regular reexamination on or after the effective date of the increase in the payment standard amount.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Change in family unit size during the HAP contract term.</E> Irrespective of any increase or decrease in the payment standard amount, if the family unit size increases or decreases during the HAP contract term, the new family unit size must be used to determine the payment standard amount for the family beginning at the family's first regular reexamination following the change in family unit size.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PHA approval of higher payment standard for the family as a reasonable accommodation.</E> If the family includes a person with disabilities and requires a payment standard above the basic range, as a reasonable accommodation for such person, in accordance with part 8 of this title, the PHA may establish a payment standard for the family of not more than 120 percent of the FMR. A PHA may establish a payment standard greater than 120 percent of the FMR by submitting a request to HUD.</P>

              <P>(ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, PHAs using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income individually. The PHA must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">COLA rate applied by PHAs.</E> PHAs using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation.

              <SUBJECT>Utility allowance schedule.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Maintaining schedule.</E> (1) The PHA must maintain a utility allowance schedule for all tenant-paid utilities (except telephone), for cost of tenant-supplied refrigerators and ranges, and for other tenant-paid housing services (e.g., trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse)).</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must give HUD a copy of the utility allowance schedule. At HUD's request, the PHA also must provide any information or procedures used in preparation of the schedule.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How allowances are determined.</E> (1) The utility allowance schedule must be determined based on the typical cost of utilities and services paid by energy-conservative households that occupy housing of similar size and type in the same locality. In developing the schedule, the PHA must use normal patterns of consumption for the community as a whole and current utility rates.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) A PHA's utility allowance schedule, and the utility allowance for an individual family, must include the utilities and services that are necessary in the locality to provide housing that complies with the housing quality standards. However, the PHA may not provide any allowance for non-essential utility costs, such as costs of cable or satellite television.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the utility allowance schedule, the PHA must classify utilities and other housing services according to the following general categories: space heating; air conditioning; cooking; water heating; water; sewer; trash collection (disposal of waste and refuse); <PRTPAGE P="556"/>other electric; refrigerator (cost of tenant-supplied refrigerator); range (cost of tenant-supplied range); and other specified housing services. The PHA must provide a utility allowance for tenant-paid air-conditioning costs if the majority of housing units in the market provide centrally air-conditioned units or there is appropriate wiring for tenant-installed air conditioners.</P>
              <P>(3) The cost of each utility and housing service category must be stated separately. For each of these categories, the utility allowance schedule must take into consideration unit size (by number of bedrooms), and unit types (e.g., apartment, row-house, town house, single-family detached, and manufactured housing) that are typical in the community.</P>
              <P>(4) The utility allowance schedule must be prepared and submitted in accordance with HUD requirements on the form prescribed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Revisions of utility allowance schedule.</E> (1) A PHA must review its schedule of utility allowances each year, and must revise its allowance for a utility category if there has been a change of 10 percent or more in the utility rate since the last time the utility allowance schedule was revised. The PHA must maintain information supporting its annual review of utility allowances and any revisions made in its utility allowance schedule.</P>
              <P>(2) At HUD's direction, the PHA must revise the utility allowance schedule to correct any errors, or as necessary to update the schedule.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of utility allowance schedule.</E> The PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the lesser of the size of dwelling unit actually leased by the family or the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards. In cases where the unit size leased exceeds the family unit size as determined under the PHA subsidy standards as a result of a reasonable accommodation, the PHA must use the appropriate utility allowance for the size of the dwelling unit actually leased by the family.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Higher utility allowance as reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities.</E> On request from a family that includes a person with disabilities, the PHA must approve a utility allowance which is higher than the applicable amount on the utility allowance schedule if a higher utility allowance is needed as a reasonable accommodation in accordance with 24 CFR part 8 to make the program accessible to and usable by the family member with a disability.</P>

              <P>(i) The PHA may consider all relevant circumstances such as the seriousness of the case, the extent of participation or culpability of individual family members, mitigating circumstances related to the disability of a family member, and the effects of denial or termination of assistance on other family members who were not involved in the action or failure.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA may impose, as a condition of continued assistance for other family members, a requirement that other family members who participated in or were culpable for the action or failure will not reside in the unit.

For this purpose, the PHA may require the applicant or tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.</P>
              <P>(iv) If the family includes a person with disabilities, the PHA decision concerning such action is subject to consideration of reasonable accommodation in accordance with part 8 of this title.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Denial of admission</E>—(1) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of drug criminals.</E> (i) The PHA <E T="03">must</E> prohibit admission to the program of an applicant for three years from the date of eviction if a household member has been evicted from federally assisted housing for drug-related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:</P>
              <P>(A) That the evicted household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program approved by the PHA; or</P>
              <P>(B) That the circumstances leading to eviction no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission if:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug;</P>
              <P>(B) The PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's illegal drug use or a pattern of illegal drug use may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or</P>
              <P>(C) Any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of other criminals—(i) Mandatory prohibition.</E> The PHA <E T="03">must</E> establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In this screening of applicants, the PHA must perform criminal history background checks necessary to determine whether any household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement in the State where the housing is located and in other States where the household members are known to have resided.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Permissive prohibitions.</E> (A) The PHA <E T="03">may</E> prohibit admission of a household to the program if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaged in, or has engaged in during a reasonable time before the admission:</P>
              <P>(1) Drug-related criminal activity;</P>
              <P>(2) Violent criminal activity;</P>
              <P>(3) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents or persons residing in the immediate vicinity; or</P>
              <P>(4) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health or safety of the owner, property management staff, or persons performing a contract administration function or responsibility on behalf of the PHA (including a PHA employee or a PHA contractor, subcontractor or agent).</P>
              <P>(B) The PHA may establish a period before the admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in the activities specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section (“reasonable time”).</P>
              <P>(C) If the PHA previously denied admission to an applicant because a member of the household engaged in criminal activity, the PHA may reconsider the applicant if the PHA has sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in, such criminal activity during a reasonable period, as determined by the PHA, before the admission decision.</P>

              <P>(1) The PHA would have “sufficient evidence” if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such <PRTPAGE P="561"/>sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which the PHA verified.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Prohibiting admission of alcohol abusers.</E> The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Terminating assistance</E>—(1) <E T="03">Terminating assistance for drug criminals.</E> (i) The PHA <E T="03">must</E> establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that:</P>
              <P>(A) Any household member is currently engaged in any illegal use of a drug; or</P>
              <P>(B) A pattern of illegal use of a drug by any household member interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA must immediately terminate assistance for a family under the program if the PHA determines that any member of the household has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any family member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in any drug-related criminal activity.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Terminating assistance for other criminals.</E> The PHA must establish standards that allow the PHA to terminate assistance under the program for a family if the PHA determines that any household member has violated the family's obligation under § 982.551 not to engage in violent criminal activity.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Terminating assistance for alcohol abusers.</E> The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence of criminal activity.</E> The PHA may terminate assistance for criminal activity by a household member as authorized in this section if the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the household member has engaged in the activity, regardless of whether the household member has been arrested or convicted for such activity.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Use of criminal record</E>—(1) <E T="03">Denial.</E> If a PHA proposes to deny admission for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must provide the subject of the record and the applicant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record, in the informal review process in accordance with § 982.554. (See part 5, subpart J for provision concerning access to criminal records.)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Termination of assistance.</E> If a PHA proposes to terminate assistance for criminal activity as shown by a criminal record, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the tenant with a copy of the criminal record. The PHA must give the family an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of that record in accordance with § 982.555.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Cost of obtaining criminal record.</E> The PHA may not pass along to the tenant the costs of a criminal records check.</P>
              <P>(e) The requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.</P>

                <P>(B) An SRO unit must contain at least one hundred ten square feet of floor space.</P>
                <P>(C) An SRO unit must contain at least four square feet of closet space for each resident (with an unobstructed height of at least five feet). If there is less closet space, space equal to the amount of the deficiency must be subtracted from the area of the habitable room space when determining the amount of floor space in the SRO unit. The SRO unit must contain at least one hundred ten square feet of remaining floor space after subtracting the amount of the deficiency in minimum closet space.</P>

                <P>(iii) The resident must be able to access an SRO unit without passing through any other unit.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Sprinkler system.</E> A sprinkler system that protects all major spaces, hard wired smoke detectors, and such other fire and safety improvements as State or local law may require must be installed in each building.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Assistance in cooperative housing.</E> This section applies to rental assistance for a cooperative member residing in cooperative housing. However, this section does not apply to:</P>
                <P>(1) Assistance for a cooperative member under the homeownership option pursuant to §§ 982.625 through 982.641; or</P>
                <P>(2) Rental assistance for a family that leases a cooperative housing unit from a cooperative member (such rental assistance is not a special housing type, and is subject to requirements in other subparts of this part 982).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Rent to owner.</E> (1) The reasonable rent for a cooperative unit is determined in accordance with § 982.507. For cooperative housing, the rent to owner is the monthly carrying charge under the occupancy agreement/lease between the member and the cooperative.</P>
                <P>(2) The carrying charge consists of the amount assessed to the member by the cooperative for occupancy of the housing. The carrying charge includes the member's share of the cooperative debt service, operating expenses, and necessary payments to cooperative reserve funds. However, the carrying charge does not include down-payments or other payments to purchase the cooperative unit, or to amortize a loan to the family for this purpose.</P>
                <P>(3) Gross rent is the carrying charge plus any utility allowance.</P>
                <P>(4) Adjustments are applied to the carrying charge as determined in accordance with this section.</P>
                <P>(5) The occupancy agreement/lease and other appropriate documents must provide that the monthly carrying charge is subject to Section 8 limitations on rent to owner.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Housing assistance payment.</E> The amount of the housing assistance payment is determined in accordance with subpart K of this part.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Maintenance.</E> (1) During the term of the HAP contract between the PHA and the cooperative, the dwelling unit and premises must be maintained in accordance with the HQS. If the dwelling unit and premises are not maintained in accordance with the HQS, the PHA may exercise all available remedies, regardless of whether the family or the cooperative is responsible for such breach of the HQS. PHA remedies for breach of the HQS include recovery of overpayments, abatement or other reduction of housing assistance payments, termination of housing assistance payments and termination of the HAP contract.</P>
                <P>(2) The PHA may not make any housing assistance payments if the contract unit does not meet the HQS, unless any defect is corrected within the period specified by the PHA and the PHA verifies the correction. If a defect is life-threatening, the defect must be corrected within no more than 24 hours. For other defects, the defect must be corrected within the period specified by the PHA.</P>
                <P>(3) The family is responsible for a breach of the HQS that is caused by any of the following:</P>
                <P>(i) The family fails to perform any maintenance for which the family is responsible in accordance with the terms of the cooperative occupancy agreement between the cooperative member and the cooperative;</P>
                <P>(ii) The family fails to pay for any utilities that the cooperative is not required to pay for, but which are to be paid by the cooperative member;</P>
                <P>(iii) The family fails to provide and maintain any appliances that the cooperative is not required to provide, but which are to be provided by the cooperative member; or</P>
                <P>(iv) Any member of the household or guest damages the dwelling unit or premises (damages beyond ordinary wear and tear).</P>
                <P>(4) If the family has caused a breach of the HQS for which the family is responsible, the PHA must take prompt and vigorous action to enforce such family obligations. The PHA may terminate assistance for violation of family obligations in accordance with § 982.552.</P>
                <P>(5) Section 982.404 does not apply to assistance for cooperative housing under this section.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Live-in aide.</E> (1) If approved by the PHA, a live-in aide may reside with the family to care for a person with disabilities. The PHA must approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is <PRTPAGE P="571"/>readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 8. See § 982.316 concerning occupancy by a live-in aide.</P>
                <P>(2) If there is a live-in aide, the live-in aide must be counted in determining the family unit size.</P>

                <P>(4) By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner of the manufactured home space certifies that the rent to owner for the space is not more than rent charged by the owner for unassisted rental of comparable spaces in the <PRTPAGE P="572"/>same manufactured home park or elsewhere.

                <P>(6) Except for cooperative members who have acquired cooperative membership shares prior to commencement of homeownership assistance, no family member has a present ownership interest in a residence at the commencement of homeownership assistance for the purchase of any home.</P>
                <P>(7) Except for cooperative members who have acquired cooperative membership shares prior to the commencement of homeownership assistance, the family has entered a contract of sale in accordance with § 982.631(c).</P>
                <P>(8) The family also satisfies any other initial requirements established by the PHA (see § 982.626(b)). Any such additional requirements must be described in the PHA administrative plan.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">First-time homeowner requirements.</E> At commencement of homeownership assistance for the family, the family must be any of the following:</P>
                <P>(1) A first-time homeowner (defined at § 982.4);</P>
                <P>(2) A cooperative member (defined at § 982.4); or</P>

                <P>(ii) In the case of other families, the Federal minimum wage multiplied by 2,000 hours.</P>
                <P>(2)(i) Except in the case of an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title), the PHA shall not count any welfare assistance received by the family in determining annual income under this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) The disregard of welfare assistance income under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section only affects the determination of minimum annual income used to determine if a family initially qualifies for commencement of homeownership assistance in accordance with this section, but does not affect:</P>
                <P>(A) The determination of income-eligibility for admission to the voucher program;</P>

                <P>(iii) In the case of an elderly or disabled family, the PHA shall include welfare assistance for the adult family members who will own the home in determining if the family meets the minimum income requirement.</P>
                <P>(3) A PHA may establish a minimum income standard that is higher than those described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for either or both types of families. However, a family that meets the applicable HUD minimum income requirement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, but not the higher standard established by the PHA shall be considered to satisfy the minimum income requirement if:</P>
                <P>(i) The family demonstrates that it has been pre-qualified or pre-approved for financing;</P>
                <P>(ii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing meets any PHA established requirements under § 982.632 for financing the purchase of the home (including qualifications of lenders and terms of financing); and</P>
                <P>(iii) The pre-qualified or pre-approved financing amount is sufficient to purchase housing that meets HQS in the PHA's jurisdiction.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Employment requirements.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the family must demonstrate that one or more adult members of the family who will own the home at commencement of homeownership assistance:</P>
                <P>(i) Is currently employed on a full-time basis (the term “full-time employment” means not less than an average of 30 hours per week); and</P>
                <P>(ii) Has been continuously so employed during the year before commencement of homeownership assistance for the family.</P>
                <P>(2) The PHA shall have discretion to determine whether and to what extent interruptions are considered to break continuity of employment during the year. The PHA may count successive employment during the year. The PHA may count self-employment in a business.</P>
                <P>(3) The employment requirement does not apply to an elderly family or a disabled family (see the definitions of these terms at § 5.403(b) of this title). Furthermore, if a family, other than an elderly family or a disabled family, includes a person with disabilities, the PHA shall grant an exemption from the employment requirement if the PHA determines that an exemption is needed as a reasonable accommodation so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities in accordance with part 8 of this title.</P>
                <P>(4) A PHA may not establish an employment requirement in addition to the employment standard established by this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Prohibition against assistance to family that has defaulted.</E> The PHA shall not commence homeownership assistance for a family that includes an individual who was an adult member of a family at the time when such family received homeownership assistance and <PRTPAGE P="576"/>defaulted on a mortgage securing debt incurred to purchase the home.</P>

                <P>(3) The PHA may establish policies that prohibit more than one move by the family during any one-year period. However, these policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.</P>

However, the following requirements do not apply:</P>
                <P>(1) The requirement for pre-assistance counseling (§ 982.630) is not applicable. However, the PHA may require that the family complete additional counseling (before or after moving to a new unit with continued assistance under the homeownership option).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Homeownership option: Pilot program for homeownership assistance for disabled families.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> This section implements the pilot program authorized by section 302 of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000. Under the pilot program, a PHA may provide homeownership assistance to a disabled family residing in a home purchased and owned by one or more members of the family. A PHA that administers tenant-based assistance has the choice whether to offer homeownership assistance under the pilot program (whether or not the PHA has also decided to offer the homeownership option).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability of homeownership option requirements.</E> Except as provided in this section, all of the regulations applicable to the homeownership option (as described in §§ 982.625 through 982.641) are also applicable to the pilot program.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Initial eligibility requirements.</E> Before commencing homeownership assistance under the pilot program for a family, the PHA must determine that all of the following initial requirements have been satisfied:</P>
                <P>(1) The family is a disabled family (as defined in § 5.403 of this title);</P>
                <P>(2) The family annual income does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area;</P>
                <P>(3) The family is not a current homeowner;</P>
                <P>(4) The family must close on the purchase of the home during the period starting on July 23, 2001 and ending on July 23, 2004; and</P>
                <P>(5) The family meets the initial requirements described in § 982.626; however, the following initial requirements do not apply to a family seeking to participate in the pilot program:</P>

                <P>(i) The income eligibility requirements of § 982.201(b)(1);<PRTPAGE P="585"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) The first-time homeowner requirements of § 982.627(b); and</P>
                <P>(iii) The mortgage default requirements of § 982.627(e), if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Amount and distribution of homeownership assistance payments.</E> (1) While the family is residing in the home, the PHA shall calculate a monthly homeownership assistance payment on behalf of the family in accordance with § 982.635 and this section.</P>
                <P>(2) A family that is a low income family (as defined at 24 CFR 5.603(b)) as determined by HUD shall receive the full amount of the monthly homeownership assistance payment calculated under § 982.635.</P>
                <P>(3) A family whose annual income is greater than the low income family ceiling but does not exceed 89 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 66 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.</P>
                <P>(4) A family whose annual income is greater than the 89 percent ceiling but does not exceed 99 percent of the median income for the area as determined by HUD shall receive a monthly homeownership assistance payment equal to 33 percent of the amount calculated under § 982.635.</P>
                <P>(5) A family whose annual income is greater than 99 percent of the median income for the area shall not receive homeownership assistance under the pilot program.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Assistance payments to lender.</E> The PHA must make homeownership assistance payments to a lender on behalf of the disabled family. If the assistance payment exceeds the amount due to the lender, the PHA must pay the excess directly to the family. The provisions of § 982.635(d), which permit the PHA to make monthly homeownership assistance payments directly to the family, do not apply to the pilot program.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Mortgage defaults.</E> The requirements of § 982.638(d) regarding mortgage defaults are applicable to the pilot program. However, notwithstanding § 982.638(d), the PHA may, in its discretion, permit a family that has defaulted on its mortgage to move to a new unit with continued voucher homeownership assistance if the PHA determines that the default is due to catastrophic medical reasons or due to the impact of a federally declared major disaster or emergency. The requirements of §§ 982.627(a)(5) and 982.627(e) do not apply to such a family.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Homeownership option: Downpayment assistance grants.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) A PHA may provide a single downpayment assistance grant for a participant that has received tenant-based or project-based rental assistance in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.</P>
                <P>(2) The downpayment assistance grant must be applied toward the downpayment required in connection with the purchase of the home and/or reasonable and customary closing costs in connection with the purchase of the home.</P>
                <P>(3) If the PHA permits the downpayment grant to be applied to closing costs, the PHA must define what fees and charges constitute reasonable and customary closing costs. However, if the purchase of a home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements, including any requirements concerning closing costs (see § 982.632(b) of this part regarding the applicability of FHA requirements to voucher homeownership assistance and § 203.27 of this title regarding allowable fees, charges and discounts for FHA-insured mortgages).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Maximum downpayment grant.</E> A downpayment assistance grant may not exceed twelve times the difference between the payment standard and the total tenant payment.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of downpayment grant.</E> The downpayment assistance grant shall be paid at the closing of the family's purchase of the home.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Administrative fee.</E> For each downpayment assistance grant made by the PHA, HUD will pay the PHA a one-time administrative fee in accordance with § 982.152(a)(1)(iii).<PRTPAGE P="586"/>
                </P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Return to tenant-based assistance.</E> A family that has received a downpayment assistance grant may apply for and receive tenant-based rental assistance, in accordance with program requirements and PHA policies. However, the PHA may not commence tenant-based rental assistance for occupancy of the new unit so long as any member of the family owns any title or other interest in the home purchased with homeownership assistance. Further, eighteen months must have passed since the family's receipt of the downpayment assistance grant.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Implementation of downpayment assistance grants.</E> A PHA may not offer downpayment assistance under this paragraph until HUD publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

              <SUBJECT>Description of the PBV program.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">How PBV works.</E> (1) The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under an annual contributions contract (ACC) with HUD. In the PBV program, the assistance is “attached to the structure.” (See description of the difference between “project-based” and “tenant-based” rental assistance at 24 CFR 982.1(b).)</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA enters into a HAP contract with an owner for units in existing housing or in newly constructed or rehabilitated housing.</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of newly constructed or rehabilitated housing, the housing is developed under an Agreement between the owner and the PHA. In the Agreement, the PHA agrees to execute a HAP contract after the owner completes the construction or rehabilitation of the units.</P>
              <P>(4) During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA makes housing assistance payments to the owner for units leased and occupied by eligible families.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">How PBV is funded.</E> (1) If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC. This pool of funding is used to pay housing assistance for both tenant-based and project-based voucher units and to pay PHA administrative fees for administration of tenant-based and project-based voucher assistance.</P>
              <P>(2) There is no special or additional funding for project-based vouchers. HUD does not reserve additional units for project-based vouchers and does not provide any additional funding for this purpose.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PHA discretion to operate PBV program.</E> A PHA has discretion whether to operate a PBV program. HUD approval is not required, except that the PHA must notify HUD of its intent to project-base its vouchers, in accordance with § 983.6(d).</P>
              <CITA>[70 FR 59913, Oct. 13, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 36165, June 25, 2014]</CITA>

              <SUBJECT>Maximum amount of PBV assistance.</SUBJECT>

              <SUBJECT>Owner proposal selection procedures.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Procedures for selecting PBV proposals.</E> The PHA administrative plan must describe the procedures for owner submission of PBV proposals and for PHA selection of PBV proposals. Before selecting a PBV proposal, the PHA must determine that the PBV proposal complies with HUD program regulations and requirements, including a determination that the property is eligible housing (§§ 983.53 and 983.54), complies with the cap on the number of PBV units per project (§ 983.56), and meets the site selection standards (§ 983.57).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Selection of PBV proposals.</E> The PHA must select PBV proposals in accordance with the selection procedures in the PHA administrative plan. The PHA must select PBV proposals by either of the following two methods.<PRTPAGE P="594"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) PHA request for PBV Proposals. The PHA may not limit proposals to a single site or impose restrictions that explicitly or practically preclude owner submission of proposals for PBV housing on different sites.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Selection based on previous competition.</E> The PHA may select, without competition, a proposal for housing assisted under a federal, State, or local government housing assistance, community development, or supportive services program that required competitive selection of proposals (e.g., HOME, and units for which competitively awarded low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs) have been provided), where the proposal has been selected in accordance with such program's competitive selection requirements within 3 years of the PBV proposal selection date, and the earlier competitively selected housing assistance proposal did not involve any consideration that the project would receive PBV assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Public notice of PHA request for PBV proposals.</E> If the PHA will be selecting proposals under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, PHA procedures for selecting PBV proposals must be designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice of the opportunity to offer PBV proposals for consideration by the PHA. The public notice procedures may include publication of the public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation and other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice. The public notice of the PHA request for PBV proposals must specify the submission deadline. Detailed application and selection information must be provided at the request of interested parties.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">PHA notice of owner selection.</E> The PHA must give prompt written notice to the party that submitted a selected proposal and must also give prompt public notice of such selection. Public notice procedures may include publication of public notice in a local newspaper of general circulation and other means designed and actually operated to provide broad public notice.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">PHA-owned units.</E> A PHA-owned unit may be assisted under the PBV program only if the HUD field office or HUD-approved independent entity reviews the selection process and determines that the PHA-owned units were appropriately selected based on the selection procedures specified in the PHA administrative plan. Under no circumstances may PBV assistance be used with a public housing unit.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Public review of PHA selection decision documentation.</E> The PHA must make documentation available for public inspection regarding the basis for the PHA selection of a PBV proposal.</P>
              <P>(g) Owner proposal selection does not require submission of form HUD-2530 or other HUD previous participation clearance.</P>

The subsidy layering review is intended to prevent excessive public assistance for the housing by combining (layering) housing assistance payment subsidy under the PBV program with other governmental housing assistance from federal, state, or local agencies, including assistance such as tax concessions or <PRTPAGE P="596"/>tax credits. The subsidy layering requirements are not applicable to existing housing. A further subsidy layering review is not required for housing selected as new construction or rehabilitation of housing, if HUD's designee has conducted a review, which included a review of PBV assistance, in accordance with HUD's PBV subsidy layering review guidelines.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">When subsidy layering review is conducted.</E> The PHA may not enter into an Agreement or HAP contract until HUD or a housing credit agency approved by HUD has conducted any required subsidy layering review and determined that the PBV assistance is in accordance with HUD subsidy layering requirements.</P>

              <P>(B) Families receiving supportive services. PHAs must include in the PHA administrative plan the type of services offered to families for a project to qualify for the exception and the extent to which such services will be provided. It is not necessary that the services be provided at or by the project, if they are approved services. To qualify, a family must have at least one member receiving at least one qualifying supportive service. A PHA may not require participation in medical or disability-related services other than drug and alcohol treatment in the case of current abusers as a condition of living in an excepted unit, although such services may be offered. If a family at the time of initial tenancy is receiving, and while the resident of an excepted unit has received, FSS supportive services or any other supportive services as defined in the PHA administrative plan, and successfully completes the FSS contract of participation or the supportive services requirement, the unit continues to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in the unit. If a family in an excepted unit fails without good cause to complete its FSS contract of participation or if the family fails to complete the supportive services requirement as outlined in the PHA administrative plan, the PHA will take the actions provided under § 983.262(d), and the owner may terminate the lease in accordance with § 983.257(c). Also, at the time of initial lease execution between the family and the owner, the family and the PHA must sign a statement of family responsibility. The statement of family responsibility must contain all family obligations including the family's participation in a service program under this section. Failure by the family without good cause to fulfill its service obligation will require the PHA to terminate assistance. If the unit at the time of such termination is an excepted unit, the exception continues to apply to the unit as long as the unit is made available to another qualifying family.</P>

              <P>(C) The PHA must monitor the excepted family's continued receipt of <PRTPAGE P="597"/>supportive services and take appropriate action regarding those families that fail without good cause to complete their supportive services requirement. The PHA administrative plan must state the form and frequency of such monitoring.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Site selection standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The site selection requirements in paragraph (d) of this section apply only to site selection for existing housing and rehabilitated PBV housing. The site selection requirements in paragraph (e) of this section apply only to site selection for newly constructed PBV housing. Other provisions of this section apply to selection of a site for any form of PBV housing, including existing housing, newly constructed housing, and rehabilitated housing.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Compliance with PBV goals, civil rights requirements, and HQS.</E> The PHA may not select a proposal for existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated PBV housing on a site or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract for units on the site, unless the PHA has determined that:</P>
              <P>(1) Project-based assistance for housing at the selected site is consistent with the goal of deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities. The standard for deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and economic opportunities must be consistent with the PHA Plan under 24 CFR part 903 and the PHA Administrative Plan. In developing the standards to apply in determining whether a proposed PBV development will be selected, a PHA must consider the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is in a HUD-designated Enterprise Zone, Economic Community, or Renewal Community;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether a PBV development will be located in a census tract where the concentration of assisted units will be or has decreased as a result of public housing demolition;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the census tract in which the proposed PBV development will be located is undergoing significant revitalization;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether state, local, or federal dollars have been invested in the area that has assisted in the achievement of the statutory requirement;</P>
              <P>(v) Whether new market rate units are being developed in the same census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located and the likelihood that such market rate units will positively impact the poverty rate in the area;</P>
              <P>(vi) If the poverty rate in the area where the proposed PBV development will be located is greater than 20 percent, the PHA should consider whether in the past five years there has been an overall decline in the poverty rate;</P>
              <P>(vii) Whether there are meaningful opportunities for educational and economic advancement in the census tract where the proposed PBV development will be located.</P>

              <P>(2) The site is suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d(4)) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 1; Title VIII of <PRTPAGE P="598"/>the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601-3629); and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 100 through 199; Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527; 3 CFR, 1959-1963 Comp., p. 652) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 107. The site must meet the section 504 site selection requirements described in 24 CFR 8.4(b)(5).</P>
              <P>(3) The site meets the HQS site standards at 24 CFR 982.401(l).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">PHA PBV site selection policy.</E> (1) The PHA administrative plan must establish the PHA's policy for selection of PBV sites in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The site selection policy must explain how the PHA's site selection procedures promote the PBV goals.</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA must select PBV sites in accordance with the PHA's site selection policy in the PHA administrative plan.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Existing and rehabilitated housing site and neighborhood standards.</E> A site for existing or rehabilitated housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards. The site must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities and streets must be available to service the site. (The existence of a private disposal system and private sanitary water supply for the site, approved in accordance with law, may be considered adequate utilities.)</P>
              <P>(2) Promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.</P>
              <P>(3) Be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.</P>
              <P>(4) Be so located that travel time and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers is not excessive. While it is important that housing for the elderly not be totally isolated from employment opportunities, this requirement need not be adhered to rigidly for such projects.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">New construction site and neighborhood standards.</E> A site for newly constructed housing must meet the following site and neighborhood standards:</P>
              <P>(1) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities (water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets must be available to service the site.</P>
              <P>(2) The site must not be located in an area of minority concentration, except as permitted under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and must not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to non-minority residents in the area.</P>
              <P>(3) A project may be located in an area of minority concentration only if:</P>
              <P>(i) Sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority families in the income range to be served by the proposed project outside areas of minority concentration (see paragraph (e)(3)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section for further guidance on this criterion); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot be met in that housing market area (see paragraph (e) (3)(vi)) of this section for further guidance on this criterion).</P>

              <P>(iii) As used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, “sufficient” does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year, that, over a period of several years, will approach an appropriate balance of housing choices within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for low-income minority families and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.<PRTPAGE P="599"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Units may be considered “comparable opportunities,” as used in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, if they have the same household type (elderly, disabled, family, large family) and tenure type (owner/renter); require approximately the same tenant contribution towards rent; serve the same income group; are located in the same housing market; and are in standard condition.</P>
              <P>(v) Application of this sufficient, comparable opportunities standard involves assessing the overall impact of HUD-assisted housing on the availability of housing choices for low-income minority families in and outside areas of minority concentration, and must take into account the extent to which the following factors are present, along with other factors relevant to housing choice:</P>
              <P>(A) A significant number of assisted housing units are available outside areas of minority concentration.</P>
              <P>(B) There is significant integration of assisted housing projects constructed or rehabilitated in the past 10 years, relative to the racial mix of the eligible population.</P>
              <P>(C) There are racially integrated neighborhoods in the locality.</P>
              <P>(D) Programs are operated by the locality to assist minority families that wish to find housing outside areas of minority concentration.</P>

              <P>(E) Minority families have benefited from local activities (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, acquisition and write-down of sites, tax relief programs for homeowners, acquisitions of units for use as assisted housing units) undertaken to expand choice for minority families outside of areas of minority concentration.</P>
              <P>(F) A significant proportion of minority households has been successful in finding units in non-minority areas under the tenant-based assistance programs.</P>
              <P>(G) Comparable housing opportunities have been made available outside areas of minority concentration through other programs.</P>
              <P>(vi) Application of the “overriding housing needs” criterion, for example, permits approval of sites that are an integral part of an overall local strategy for the preservation or restoration of the immediate neighborhood and of sites in a neighborhood experiencing significant private investment that is demonstrably improving the economic character of the area (a “revitalizing area”). An “overriding housing need,” however, may not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable, if the only reason the need cannot otherwise be feasibly met is that discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, familial status, or disability renders sites outside areas of minority concentration unavailable or if the use of this standard in recent years has had the effect of circumventing the obligation to provide housing choice.</P>
              <P>(4) The site must promote greater choice of housing opportunities and avoid undue concentration of assisted persons in areas containing a high proportion of low-income persons.</P>
              <P>(5) The neighborhood must not be one that is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other undesirable conditions predominate, unless there is actively in progress a concerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions.</P>
              <P>(6) The housing must be accessible to social, recreational, educational, commercial, and health facilities and services and other municipal facilities and services that are at least equivalent to those typically found in neighborhoods consisting largely of unassisted, standard housing of similar market rents.</P>
              <P>(7) Except for new construction, housing designed for elderly persons, travel time, and cost via public transportation or private automobile from the neighborhood to places of employment providing a range of jobs for lower-income workers, must not be excessive.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Who performs the environmental review?</E> (1) Under 24 CFR part 58, a unit of general local government, a county or a state (the “responsible entity” or “RE”) is responsible for the federal environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 <PRTPAGE P="600"/>U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) and related applicable federal laws and authorities in accordance with 24 CFR 58.5 and 58.6.</P>
              <P>(2) If a PHA objects in writing to having the RE perform the federal environmental review, or if the RE declines to perform it, then HUD may perform the review itself (24 CFR 58.11). 24 CFR part 50 governs HUD performance of the review.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Existing housing.</E> In the case of existing housing under this part 983, the RE that is responsible for the environmental review under 24 CFR part 58 must determine whether or not PBV assistance is categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act and whether or not the assistance is subject to review under the laws and authorities listed in 24 CFR 58.5.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations on actions before completion of the environmental review.</E> (1) The PHA may not enter into an Agreement or HAP contract with an owner, and the PHA, the owner, and its contractors may not acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair, dispose of, demolish, or construct real property or commit or expend program or local funds for PBV activities under this part, until one of the following occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) The responsible entity has completed the environmental review procedures required by 24 CFR part 58, and HUD has approved the environmental certification and HUD has given a release of funds, as defined in § 983.3(b);</P>
              <P>(ii) The responsible entity has determined that the project to be assisted is exempt under 24 CFR 58.34 or is categorically excluded and not subject to compliance with environmental laws under 24 CFR 58.35(b); or</P>
              <P>(iii) HUD has performed an environmental review under 24 CFR part 50 and has notified the PHA in writing of environmental approval of the site.</P>

              <P>(2) HUD will not approve the release of funds for PBV assistance under this part if the PHA, the owner, or any other party commits funds (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, enters an Agreement or HAP contract or otherwise incurs any costs or expenditures to be paid or reimbursed with such funds) before the PHA submits and HUD approves its request for release of funds (where such submission is required).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">PHA duty to supply information.</E> The PHA must supply all available, relevant information necessary for the RE (or HUD, if applicable) to perform any required environmental review for any site.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Inspection of existing units.</E> If the units to be assisted already exist, the PHA must inspect all the units before the proposal selection date, and must determine whether the units substantially comply with the HQS. To qualify as existing housing, units must substantially comply with the HQS on the proposal selection date. However, the PHA may not execute the HAP contract until the units fully comply with the HQS.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Pre-HAP contract inspections.</E> The PHA must inspect each contract unit before execution of the HAP contract. The PHA may not enter into a HAP contract covering a unit until the unit fully complies with the HQS.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Biennial inspections.</E> (1) At least biennially during the term of the HAP <PRTPAGE P="602"/>contract, the PHA must inspect a random sample, consisting of at least 20 percent of the contract units in each building, to determine if the contract units and the premises are maintained in accordance with the HQS. Turnover inspections pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section are not counted toward meeting this inspection requirement.</P>
              <P>(2) If more than 20 percent of the sample of inspected contract units in a building fail the initial inspection, then the PHA must reinspect 100 percent of the contract units in the building.</P>
              <P>(3) A PHA may also use the procedures applicable to HCV units in 24 CFR 982.406.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Other inspections.</E> (1) The PHA must inspect contract units whenever needed to determine that the contract units comply with the HQS and that the owner is providing maintenance, utilities, and other services in accordance with the HAP contract. The PHA must take into account complaints and any other information coming to its attention in scheduling inspections.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA must conduct follow-up inspections needed to determine if the owner (or, if applicable, the family) has corrected an HQS violation, and must conduct inspections to determine the basis for exercise of contractual and other remedies for owner or family violation of the HQS. (Family HQS obligations are specified in 24 CFR 982.404(b).)</P>
              <P>(3) In conducting PHA supervisory quality control HQS inspections, the PHA should include a representative sample of both tenant-based and project-based units.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Inspecting PHA-owned units.</E> (1) In the case of PHA-owned units, the inspections required under this section must be performed by an independent agency designated in accordance with § 983.59, rather than by the PHA.</P>

The length of the term of the HAP contract for any contract unit may not be less than one year, nor more than 15 years. In the case of PHA-owned units, the term of the initial HAP contract shall be determined in accordance with § 983.59.</P>

A HAP contract extension may not exceed 15 years. A PHA may provide for multiple extensions; however, in no circumstance may such extensions exceed 15 years, cumulatively. Extensions after the initial extension are allowed at the end of any extension term provided that not more than 24 months prior to the expiration of the previous extension contract, the PHA agrees to extend the term, and that such extension is appropriate to continue providing affordable housing for low-income families or to expand housing opportunities. Extensions after the initial extension term shall not begin prior to the expiration date of the previous extension term. Subsequent extensions are subject to the same limitations described in this paragraph. Any extension of the term must be on the form and subject to the conditions prescribed by HUD at the time of the extension.

For purposes of this section, “sufficient funding” means the availability of appropriations, and of funding under the ACC from such appropriations, to make full payment of housing assistance payments payable to the owner for any contract year in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract.</P>
              <P>(2) The availability of sufficient funding must be determined by HUD or by the PHA in accordance with HUD instructions. If it is determined that there may not be sufficient funding to continue housing assistance payments for all contract units and for the full term of the HAP contract, the PHA has the right to terminate the HAP contract by notice to the owner for all or any of the contract units. Such action by the PHA shall be implemented in accordance with HUD instructions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination by owner—reduction below initial rent.</E> The owner may terminate the HAP contract, upon notice to the PHA, if the amount of the rent to owner for any contract unit, as adjusted in accordance with § 983.302, is reduced below the amount of the initial rent to owner (rent to owner at the beginning of the HAP contract term). In this case, the assisted families residing in the contract units will be offered tenant-based voucher assistance.</P>

An amendment to the HAP contract is subject to all PBV requirements (e.g., rents are reasonable), except that a new PBV request for proposals is not required. The anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract for the additional units must be the same as the anniversary and expiration dates of the HAP contract term for the PBV units originally placed under HAP contract.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Staged completion of contract units.</E> Even if contract units are placed under the HAP contract in stages commencing on different dates, there is a single annual anniversary for all contract units under the HAP contract. The annual anniversary for all contract units is the annual anniversary date for the first contract units placed under the HAP contract. The expiration of the HAP contract for all the contract units completed in stages must be concurrent with the end of the HAP contract term for the units originally placed under HAP contract.</P>

              <P>(3) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may also require continuing owner compliance during the HAP term with additional housing quality requirements specified by the PHA (in addition to, but not in place of, compliance with the HUD-prescribed HQS). Such additional requirements may be designed to assure continued compliance with any design, architecture, or quality requirement specified in the Agreement.</P>

              <P>(a) All contract units are in good and tenantable condition. The owner is maintaining the premises and all contract units in accordance with the HQS.</P>
              <P>(b) The owner is providing all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities as agreed to under the HAP contract and the leases with assisted families.</P>

              <P>(d) To the best of the owner's knowledge, the members of the family reside in each contract unit for which the owner is receiving housing assistance payments, and the unit is the family's only residence.</P>
              <P>(e) The owner (including a principal or other interested party) is not the spouse, parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of a family residing in a contract unit.</P>
              <P>(f) The amount of the housing assistance payment is the correct amount due under the HAP contract.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Who may receive PBV assistance?</E> (1) The PHA may select families who are participants in the PHA's tenant-based voucher program and families who have applied for admission to the voucher program.</P>
              <P>(2) Except for voucher participants (determined eligible at original admission to the voucher program), the PHA may only select families determined eligible for admission at commencement of PBV assistance.</P>
              <P>(3) The protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, apply to admission to the project-based program.</P>
              <P>(4) A PHA may not approve a tenancy if the owner (including a principal or other interested party) of a unit is the parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, sister, or brother of any member of the family, unless the PHA determines that approving the unit would provide reasonable accommodation for a family member who is a person with disabilities.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Protection of in-place families.</E> (1) The term “in-place family” means an eligible family residing in a proposed contract unit on the proposal selection date.</P>
              <P>(2) In order to minimize displacement of in-place families, if a unit to be placed under contract that is either an existing unit or one requiring rehabilitation is occupied by an eligible family on the proposal selection date, the in-place family must be placed on the PHA's waiting list (if the family is not already on the list) and, once its continued eligibility is determined, given an absolute selection preference and referred to the project owner for an appropriately sized PBV unit in the project. (However, the PHA may deny assistance for the grounds specified in 24 CFR 982.552 and 982.553.) Admission of such families is not subject to income-targeting under 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2)(i), and such families must be referred to the owner from the PHA's waiting list. A PHA shall give such families priority for admission to the PBV program. This protection does not apply to families that are not eligible to participate in the program on the proposal selection date.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Selection from PHA waiting list.</E> (1) Applicants who will occupy PBV units must be selected by the PHA from the PHA waiting list. The PHA must select applicants from the waiting list in accordance with the policies in the PHA administrative plan.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA may use a separate waiting list for admission to PBV units or may use the same waiting list for both tenant-based assistance and PBV assistance. If the PHA chooses to use a separate waiting list for admission to PBV units, the PHA must offer to place applicants who are listed on the waiting list for tenant-based assistance on the waiting list for PBV assistance.</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA may use separate waiting lists for PBV units in individual projects or buildings (or for sets of such units) or may use a single waiting list for the PHA's whole PBV program. In either case, the waiting list may establish criteria or preferences for occupancy of particular units.</P>
              <P>(4) The PHA may merge the waiting list for PBV assistance with the PHA waiting list for admission to another assisted housing program.</P>
              <P>(5) The PHA may place families referred by the PBV owner on its PBV waiting list.</P>
              <P>(6) Not less than 75 percent of the families admitted to a PHA's tenant-based and project-based voucher programs during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list shall be extremely low-income families. The income-targeting requirements at 24 CFR 982.201(b)(2) apply to the total of admissions to the PHA's project-based voucher program and tenant-based voucher program during the PHA fiscal year from the PHA waiting list for such programs.</P>

              <P>(7) In selecting families to occupy PBV units with special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the PHA must first refer families who <PRTPAGE P="610"/>require such accessibility features to the owner (see 24 CFR 8.26 and 100.202).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preference for services offered.</E> In selecting families, PHAs may give preference to disabled families who need services offered at a particular project in accordance with the limits under this paragraph. The prohibition on granting preferences to persons with a specific disability at 24 CFR 982.207(b)(3) continues to apply.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Preference limits.</E> (i) The preference is limited to the population of families (including individuals) with disabilities that significantly interfere with their ability to obtain and maintain themselves in housing;</P>
              <P>(ii) Who, without appropriate supportive services, will not be able to obtain or maintain themselves in housing; and</P>
              <P>(iii) For whom such services cannot be provided in a nonsegregated setting.</P>
              <P>(2) Disabled residents shall not be required to accept the particular services offered at the project.</P>
              <P>(3) In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the project must be open to all otherwise eligible persons with disabilities who may benefit from services provided in the project.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Offer of PBV assistance.</E> (1) If a family refuses the PHA's offer of PBV assistance, such refusal does not affect the family's position on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance.</P>
              <P>(2) If a PBV owner rejects a family for admission to the owner's PBV units, such rejection by the owner does not affect the family's position on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance.</P>
              <P>(3) The PHA may not take any of the following actions against an applicant who has applied for, received, or refused an offer of PBV assistance:</P>
              <P>(i) Refuse to list the applicant on the PHA waiting list for tenant-based assistance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Deny any admission preference for which the applicant is currently qualified;</P>
              <P>(iii) Change the applicant's place on the waiting list based on preference, date, and time of application, or other factors affecting selection under the PHA selection policy;</P>
              <P>(iv) Remove the applicant from the waiting list for tenant-based voucher assistance.</P>

(In the PBV program, “good cause” does not include a business or economic reason or desire to use the unit for an individual, family, or non-residential rental purpose.) 24 CFR 5.858 through 5.861 on eviction for drug and alcohol abuse apply to this part. 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies to this part.</P>
              <P>(b) If a family resides in a project-based unit excepted from the 25 percent per-project cap on project-basing because of participation in an FSS or other supportive services program, and the family fails without good cause to complete its FSS contract of participation or supportive services requirement, such failure is grounds for lease termination by the owner.</P>

              <P>Housing assistance payments shall continue until the tenant rent equals the rent to owner. The cessation of housing assistance payments at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such cessation preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances if such changes occur within 180 days following the date of the last housing assistance payment by the PHA. After the 180-day period, the unit shall be removed from the HAP contract pursuant to § 983.211.</P>

              <P>(a) The family may terminate the assisted lease at any time after the first year of occupancy. The family must give the owner advance written notice of intent to vacate (with a copy to the PHA) in accordance with the lease.</P>
              <P>(b) If the family has elected to terminate the lease in this manner, the PHA must offer the family the opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance, in the form of either assistance under the voucher program or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) Before providing notice to terminate the lease under paragraph (a) of this section, a family must contact the PHA to request comparable tenant-based rental assistance if the family wishes to move with continued assistance. If voucher or other comparable tenant-based rental assistance is not immediately available upon termination of the family's lease of a PBV unit, the PHA must give the family priority to receive the next available opportunity for continued tenant-based rental assistance.</P>

              <P>(1) The above policies do not apply when the family or a member of the family is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L, and the move is needed to protect the health or safety of the family or family member, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move. A PHA may not terminate assistance if the family, with or without prior notification to the PHA, moves out of a unit in violation of the lease, if such move occurs to protect the health or safety of a family member who is or has been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking and who reasonably believed he or she was threatened with imminent harm from further violence if he or she remained in the dwelling unit, or any family member has been the victim of a sexual assault that occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the family's request to move.<PRTPAGE P="615"/>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in § 983.56(b), the PHA may not pay housing assistance under the HAP contract for contract units in excess of the 25 percent cap pursuant to § 983.56(a).</P>
              <P>(b) In referring families to the owner for admission to excepted units, the PHA must give preference to elderly and/or disabled families, or to families receiving supportive services.</P>

              <P>(d) A family (or the remaining members of the family) residing in an excepted unit that no longer meets the criteria for a “qualifying family” in connection with the 25 percent per project cap exception (i.e., a family that does not successfully complete its FSS contract of participation or the supportive services requirement as defined in the PHA administrative plan or the remaining members of a family that no longer qualifies for elderly or disabled family status where the PHA does not exercise its discretion under paragraph (e) of this section) must vacate the unit within a reasonable period of time established by the PHA, and the PHA shall cease paying housing assistance payments on behalf of the non-qualifying family. If the family fails to vacate the unit within the established time, the unit must be removed from the HAP contract unless the project is partially assisted, and it is possible for the HAP contract to be amended to substitute a different unit in the project in accordance with § 983.207(a); or the owner terminates the lease and evicts the family. The housing assistance payments for a family residing in an excepted unit that is not in compliance with its family obligations (e.g., a family fails, without good cause, to successfully complete its FSS contract of participation or supportive services requirement) shall be terminated by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(e) The PHA may allow a family that initially qualified for occupancy of an excepted unit based on elderly or disabled family status to continue to reside in a unit, where through circumstances beyond the control of the family (e.g., death of the elderly or disabled family member or long term or permanent hospitalization or nursing care), the elderly or disabled family member no longer resides in the unit. In this case, the unit may continue to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in that unit. Once the family vacates the unit, in order to continue as an excepted unit under the HAP contact, the unit must be made available to and occupied by a qualifying family.</P>

The rent to the owner for each contract unit may at no time exceed the reasonable rent, except in cases where, the PHA has elected within the HAP contract not to reduce rents below the initial rent to owner and, upon redetermination of the rent to owner, the reasonable rent would result in a rent below the initial rent. If the PHA has not elected within the HAP contract to establish the initial rent to owner as the rent floor, the rent to owner shall not at any time exceed the reasonable rent.</P>

A person or entity that conducts the comparability analysis and any PHA staff or contractor engaged in determining the housing assistance payment based on the comparability analysis may not have any direct or indirect interest in the property.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Owner certification of comparability.</E> By accepting each monthly housing assistance payment from the PHA, the owner certifies that the rent to owner is not more than rent charged by the owner for comparable unassisted units in the premises. The owner must give the PHA information requested by the PHA on rents charged by the owner for other units in the premises or elsewhere.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Payment for move-out month.</E> If an assisted family moves out of the unit, the owner may keep the housing assistance payment payable for the calendar month when the family moves out (“move-out month”). However, the owner may not keep the payment if the PHA determines that the vacancy is the owner's fault.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Vacancy payment at PHA discretion.</E> (1) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may provide for vacancy payments to the owner (in the amounts determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for a PHA-determined period of vacancy extending from the beginning of <PRTPAGE P="620"/>the first calendar month after the move-out month for a period not exceeding two full months following the move-out month.</P>
              <P>(2) The vacancy payment to the owner for each month of the maximum two-month period will be determined by the PHA, and cannot exceed the monthly rent to owner under the assisted lease, minus any portion of the rental payment received by the owner (including amounts available from the tenant's security deposit).

              <P>(2) The amount of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA is the maximum amount the owner may charge the family for rent of a contract unit. The tenant rent is payment for all housing services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities to be provided by the owner without additional charge to the tenant, in accordance with the HAP contract and lease.</P>
              <P>(3) The owner may not demand or accept any rent payment from the tenant in excess of the tenant rent as determined by the PHA. The owner must immediately return any excess payment to the tenant.</P>
              <P>(4) The family is not responsible for payment of the portion of the rent to owner covered by the housing assistance payment under the HAP contract. The owner may not terminate the tenancy of an assisted family for nonpayment of the PHA housing assistance payment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Limit of PHA responsibility.</E> (1) The PHA is responsible only for making housing assistance payments to the owner on behalf of a family in accordance with the HAP contract. The PHA is not responsible for paying the tenant rent, or for paying any other claim by the owner.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA may not use housing assistance payments or other program funds (including any administrative fee reserve) to pay any part of the tenant rent or to pay any other claim by the owner. The PHA may not make any payment to the owner for any damage to the unit, or for any other amount owed by a family under the family's lease or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Utility reimbursement.</E> (1) If the amount of the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, the PHA shall pay the amount of such excess as a reimbursement for tenant-paid utilities (“utility reimbursement”) and the tenant rent to the owner shall be zero.</P>
              <P>(2) The PHA either may pay the utility reimbursement to the family or may pay the utility bill directly to the utility supplier on behalf of the family.</P>
              <P>(3) If the PHA chooses to pay the utility supplier directly, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> (1) The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate the use of public housing assistance and housing assistance under the Section 8 rental certificate and rental voucher programs with public and private resources, to enable families eligible to receive assistance under these programs to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.</P>
              <P>(2) The purpose of this part is to implement the policies and procedures applicable to operation of a local FSS program, as established under section 23 of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437u), under HUD's rental voucher, rental certificate, and public housing programs.</P>

              <P>(i) Each PHA for which HUD reserved funding (budget authority) for additional rental certificates or rental vouchers in FY 1993 through October 20, 1998 must operate a Section 8 FSS program.</P>

              <P>(ii) Each PHA for which HUD reserved funding (budget authority) to acquire or construct additional public housing units in FY 1993 through October 20, 1998 must operate a public housing FSS program.<PRTPAGE P="622"/>

              <SUBJECT>Program objectives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The objective of the FSS program is to reduce the dependency of low-income families on welfare assistance and on Section 8, public, or any Federal, State, or local rent or homeownership subsidies. Under the FSS program, low-income families are provided opportunities for education, job training, counseling, and other forms of social service assistance, while living in assisted housing, so that they may obtain the education, employment, and business and social skills necessary to achieve self-sufficiency, as defined in § 984.103 of this subpart A. The Department will measure the success of a local FSS program not only by the number of families who achieve self-sufficiency, but also by the number of FSS families who, as a result of participation in the program, have family members who obtain their first job, or who obtain higher paying jobs; no longer need benefits received under one or more welfare programs; obtain a high school diploma or higher education degree; or accomplish similar goals that will assist the family in obtaining economic independence.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Preference in the FSS selection process.</E> a PHA has the option of giving a selection preference for up to 50 percent of its public housing FSS slots and of its Section 8 FSS slots respectively to eligible families, as defined in § 984.103, who have one or more family members currently enrolled in an FSS related service program or on the waiting list for such a program. The PHA may limit the selection preference given to participants in and applicants for FSS related service programs to one or more eligible FSS related service programs. a PHA that chooses to exercise the selection preference option must include the following information in its Action Plan:</P>
              <P>(1) The percentage of FSS slots, not to exceed 50 percent of the total number of FSS slots for each of its FSS programs, for which it will give a selection preference;</P>
              <P>(2) The FSS related service programs to which it will give a selection preference to the programs' participants and applicants; and</P>
              <P>(3) The method of outreach to, and selection of, families with one or more members participating in the identified programs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">FSS selection without preference.</E> For those FSS slots for which the PHA chooses not to exercise the selection preference provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the FSS slots must be <PRTPAGE P="629"/>filled with eligible families in accordance with an objective selection system, such as a lottery, the length of time living in subsidized housing, or the date the family expressed an interest in participating in the FSS program. The objective system to be used by the PHA must be described in the PHA's Action Plan.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Motivation as a selection factor</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> a PHA may screen families for interest, and motivation to participate in the FSS program, provided that the factors utilized by the PHA are those which solely measure the family's interest, and motivation to participate in the FSS program.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Permissible motivational screening factors.</E> Permitted motivational factors include requiring attendance at FSS orientation sessions or preselection interviews, and assigning certain tasks which indicate the family's willingness to undertake the obligations which may be imposed by the FSS contract of participation. However, any tasks assigned shall be those which may be readily accomplishable by the family, based on the family members' educational level, and disabilities, if any. Reasonable accommodations must be made for individuals with mobility, manual, sensory, speech impairments, mental or developmental disabilities.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Prohibited motivational screening factors.</E> Prohibited motivational screening factors include the family's educational level, educational or standardized motivational test results, previous job history or job performance, credit rating, marital status, number of children, or other factors, such as sensory or manual skills, and any factors which may result in discriminatory practices or treatment toward individuals with disabilities or minority or non-minority groups.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contract of participation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Each family that is selected to participate in an FSS program must enter into a contract of participation with the PHA that operates the FSS program in which the family will participate. The contract of participation shall be signed by the head of the FSS family.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Form and content of contract</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The contract of participation, which incorporates the individual training and services plan(s), shall be in the form prescribed by HUD, and shall set forth the principal terms and conditions governing participation in the FSS program, including the rights and responsibilities of the FSS family and of the PHA, the services to be provided to, and the activities to be completed by, the head of the FSS family and each adult member of the family who elects to participate in the program.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Interim goals.</E> The individual training and services plan, incorporated in the contract of participation, shall establish specific interim and final goals by which the PHA, and the family, may measure the family's progress toward fulfilling its obligations under the contract of participation, and becoming self-sufficient. For each participating FSS family that is a recipient of welfare assistance, the PHA must establish as an interim goal that the family become independent from welfare assistance and remain independent from welfare assistance at least one year before the expiration of the term of the contract of participation, including any extension thereof.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Compliance with lease terms.</E> The contract of participation shall provide that one of the obligations of the FSS family is to comply with the terms and conditions of the respective public housing lease or Section 8-assisted lease.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Employment obligation</E>—(i) <E T="03">Head of family's obligation.</E> The head of the FSS family shall be required under the contract of participation to seek and maintain suitable employment during the term of the contract and any extension thereof. Although other members of the FSS family may seek and maintain employment during the term of the contract, only the head of the FSS family is required to seek and maintain suitable employment.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Seek employment.</E> The obligation to seek employment means that the head of the FSS family has applied for employment, attended job interviews, and has otherwise followed through on employment opportunities.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Determination of suitable employment.</E> A determination of suitable employment shall be made by the PHA based on the skills, education, and job training of the individual that has been designated the head of the FSS family, and based on the available job opportunities within the jurisdiction served by the PHA.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Consequences of noncompliance with the contract.</E> The contract of participation shall specify that if the FSS family fails to comply, without good cause, with the terms and conditions of the contract of participation, which includes compliance with the public <PRTPAGE P="631"/>housing lease or the Section 8-assisted lease, the PHA may:</P>
              <P>(i) Withhold the supportive services;</P>
              <P>(ii) Terminate the family's participation in the FSS program; or</P>
              <P>(iii) For the Section 8 FSS program, terminate or withhold the family's Section 8 assistance, except in the case where the only basis for noncompliance with the contract of participation is noncompliance with the lease, or failure to become independent from welfare assistance. However, failure to become independent from welfare assistance because of failure of the head of household to meet the employment obligation described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, or failure of the FSS family to meet any other obligation under the contract of participation, except the interim goal concerning welfare assistance, is grounds for the PHA to terminate or withhold Section 8 assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contract term.</E> The contract of participation shall provide that each FSS family will be required to fulfill those obligations to which the participating family has committed itself under the contract of participation no later than 5 years after the effective date of the contract.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Contract extension.</E> The PHA shall, in writing, extend the term of the contract of participation for a period not to exceed two years for any FSS family that requests, in writing, an extension of the contract, provided that the PHA finds that good cause exists for granting the extension. The family's written request for an extension must include a description of the need for the extension. As used in this paragraph (d), “good cause” means circumstances beyond the control of the FSS family, as determined by the PHA, such as a serious illness or involuntary loss of employment. Extension of the contract of participation will entitle the FSS family to continue to have amounts credited to the family's FSS account in accordance with § 984.304.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Unavailability of supportive services</E>—(1) <E T="03">Good faith effort to replace unavailable services.</E> If a social service agency fails to deliver the supportive services pledged under an FSS family member's individual training and services plan, the PHA shall make a good faith effort to obtain these services from another agency.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Assessment of necessity of services.</E> If the PHA is unable to obtain the services from another agency, the PHA shall reassess the family member's needs, and determine whether other available services would achieve the same purpose. If other available services would not achieve the same purpose, the PHA shall determine whether the unavailable services are integral to the FSS family's advancement or progress toward self-sufficiency. If the unavailable services are:</P>
              <P>(i) Determined not to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency, the PHA shall revise the individual training and services plan to delete these services, and modify the contract of participation to remove any obligation on the part of the FSS family to accept the unavailable services, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Determined to be integral to the FSS family's advancement toward self-sufficiency (which may be the case if the affected family member is the head of the FSS family), the PHA shall declare the contract of participation null and void. Nullification of the contract of participation on the basis of unavailability of supportive services shall not be grounds for termination of Section 8 assistance.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Modification.</E> The PHA and the FSS family may mutually agree to modify the contract of participation. The contract of participation may be modified in writing with respect to the individual training and services plans, the contract term in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and designation of the head of the family.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Completion of the contract.</E> The contract of participation is considered to be completed, and a family's participation in the FSS program is considered to be concluded when one of the following occurs:</P>
              <P>(1) The FSS family has fulfilled all of its obligations under the contract of participation on or before the expiration of the contract term, including any extension thereof; or</P>

              <P>(2) 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the FSS family equals or exceeds the published existing housing <PRTPAGE P="632"/>fair market rent for the size of the unit for which the FSS family qualifies based on the PHA's occupancy standards. The contract of participation will be considered completed and the family's participation in the FSS program concluded on this basis even though the contract term, including any extension thereof, has not expired, and the family members who have individual training and services plans have not completed all the activities set forth in their plans.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Termination of the contract.</E> The contract of participation is automatically terminated if the family's Section 8 assistance is terminated in accordance with HUD requirements. The contract of participation may be terminated before the expiration of the contract term, and any extension thereof, by:</P>
              <P>(1) Mutual consent of the parties;</P>
              <P>(2) The failure of the FSS family to meet its obligations under the contract of participation without good cause, including in the Section 8 FSS program the failure to comply with the contract requirements because the family has moved outside the jurisdiction of the PHA;</P>
              <P>(3) The family's withdrawal from the FSS program;</P>
              <P>(4) Such other act as is deemed inconsistent with the purpose of the FSS program; or</P>
              <P>(5) Operation of law.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Option to terminate Section 8 housing and supportive service assistance.</E> The PHA may terminate or withhold Section 8 housing assistance, the supportive services, and the FSS family's participation in the FSS program, if the PHA determines, in accordance with the hearing procedures provided in 24 CFR 982.555 that the FSS family has failed to comply without good cause with the requirements of the contract of participation as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Transitional supportive service assistance.</E> a PHA may continue to offer to a former FSS family who has completed its contract of participation and whose head of family is employed, appropriate FSS supportive services in becoming self-sufficient (if the family still resides in public housing, or Section 8-assisted housing), or in remaining self-sufficient (if the family no longer resides in public, Section 8-assisted housing, or other assisted housing).</P>

              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Reduction of amounts due by FSS family.</E> If the FSS family has not paid the family contribution towards rent, or other amounts, if any, due under the public housing or section 8-assisted lease, the balance in the family's FSS account shall be reduced by that amount (as reported by the owner to the PHA in the Section 8 FSS program) before prorating the interest income. If the FSS family has fraudulently under-reported income, the amount credited to the FSS account will be based on the income amounts originally reported by the FSS family.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relocating FSS family.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “relocating FSS family” refers to an FSS family that moves from the jurisdiction of a PHA at least 12 months after signing its contract of participation.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initial occupancy</E>—(1) <E T="03">First 12 months.</E> A family participating in the Section 8 FSS program must lease an assisted unit, for a minimum period of 12 months after the effective date of the contract of participation, in the jurisdiction of the PHA that selected the family for the FSS program. However, the PHA may approve a family's request to move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter) during this period.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">After the first 12 months.</E> After the first 12 months of the FSS contract of participation, the FSS family may move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Portability: relocation but continued participation in the FSS program of the</E> initial PHA—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> A relocating FSS family may continue in the FSS <PRTPAGE P="635"/>program of the initial PHA if the family demonstrates to the satisfaction of the initial PHA that, notwithstanding the move, the relocating FSS family will be able to fulfill its responsibilities under the initial or modified contract of participation at its new place of residence. (For example, the FSS family may be able to commute to the supportive services specified in the contract of participation, or the family may move to obtain employment as specified in the contract.)</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Single contract of participation.</E> If the relocating family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA, there will only be one contract of participation, which shall be the contract executed by the initial PHA.</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Two contracts of participation.</E> If the receiving PHA allows the relocating FSS family to participate in its FSS program, the receiving PHA will enter into a new contract of participation with the FSS family for the term on the remaining contract with the initial PHA. The initial PHA will terminate its contract of participation with the family.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Single FSS account.</E> Regardless of whether the relocating FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA or is enrolled in the FSS program of the receiving PHA, there will be a single FSS account which will be maintained by the initial PHA. When an FSS family will be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA will transfer the family's FSS account to the receiving PHA.</P>

              <P>(i) Terminate the FSS family from the FSS program and the family's FSS account will be forfeited; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Terminate the FSS family's Section 8 assistance on the ground that the family failed to meet its obligations under the contract of participation.</P>
              <P>(2) In the event of forfeiture of the family's FSS account, the funds in the family's FSS account will revert to the PHA maintaining the FSS account for the family.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Purpose and applicability.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) is designed to assess whether the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs operate to help eligible families afford decent rental units at the correct subsidy cost. SEMAP also establishes a system for HUD to measure PHA performance in key Section 8 program areas and to assign performance ratings. SEMAP provides procedures for HUD to identify PHA management capabilities and deficiencies in order to target monitoring and program assistance more effectively. PHAs can use the SEMAP performance analysis to assess and improve their own program operations.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> This rule applies to PHA administration of the tenant-based Section 8 rental voucher and rental certificate programs (24 CFR part 982), the project-based component (PBC) of the certificate program (24 CFR part 983) to the extent that PBC family and unit data are reported and measured under the stated HUD verification method, and enrollment levels and contributions to escrow accounts for Section 8 participants under the family self-sufficiency program (FSS) (24 CFR part 984).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Indicators, HUD verification methods and ratings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>This section states the performance indicators that are used to assess PHA Section 8 management. HUD will use the verification method identified for each indicator in reviewing the accuracy of an PHA's annual SEMAP certification. HUD will prepare a SEMAP profile for each PHA and will assign a rating for each indicator as shown. If the HUD verification method for the indicator relies on data in MTCS and HUD determines those data are insufficient to verify the PHA's certification on the indicator due to the PHA's failure to adequately report family data, HUD will assign a zero rating for the indicator. The method for selecting the PHA's quality control sample under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) of this section must leave a clear audit trail that can be used to verify that the PHA's quality control sample was drawn in an unbiased manner.</P>
              <P>An PHA that expends less than $300,000 in Federal awards and whose Section 8 programs are not audited by an independent auditor (IA), will not be rated under the SEMAP indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section for which the annual IA audit report is a HUD verification method. For those PHAs, the SEMAP score and overall performance rating will be determined based only on the remaining indicators in paragraphs (i) through (o) of this section as applicable. Although the SEMAP performance rating will not be determined using the indicators in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, PHAs not subject to Federal audit requirements must still complete the SEMAP certification for these indicators and performance under the indicators is subject to HUD confirmatory reviews.</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Selection from the waiting list.</E> (1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has written policies in its administrative plan for selecting applicants from the waiting list and whether the PHA follows these policies when selecting applicants for admission from the waiting list. (24 CFR 982.54(d)(1) and 982.204(a))</P>
              <P>(2) HUD verification method: The independent auditor (IA) annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.</P>
              <P>(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA has written waiting list selection policies in its administrative plan and,</P>
              <P>(B) Based on the PHA's quality control samples, drawn separately for applicants reaching the top of the waiting list and for admissions, documentation shows that at least 98 percent of the families in both samples of applicants and admissions were selected from the waiting list for admission in accordance with these policies and met the selection criteria that determined their places on the waiting list and their order of selection. 15 points.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statement in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section. 0 points.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reasonable rent.</E> (1) This indicator shows whether the PHA has and implements a reasonable written method to determine and document for each unit leased that the rent to owner is reasonable based on current rents for comparable unassisted units: At the time of initial leasing; if there is any increase in the rent to owner; at the HAP <PRTPAGE P="638"/>contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published fair market rent (FMR) in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. The PHA's method must take into consideration the location, size, type, quality and age of the units, and the amenities, housing services, and maintenance and utilities provided by the owners in determining comparability and the reasonable rent. (24 CFR 982.4, 24 CFR 982.54(d)(15), 982.158(f)(7) and 982.507)</P>
              <P>(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.</P>
              <P>(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA has a reasonable written method to determine reasonable rent which considers location, size, type, quality and age of the units and the amenities, housing services, and maintenance and utilities provided by the owners; and</P>
              <P>(B) Based on the PHA's quality control sample of tenant files, the PHA follows its written method to determine reasonable rent and has documented its determination that the rent to owner is reasonable in accordance with § 982.507 of this chapter for at least 98 percent of units sampled at the time of initial leasing, if there is any increase in the rent to owner, and at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. 20 points.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification includes the statements in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, except that the PHA documents its determination of reasonable rent for only 80 to 97 percent of units sampled at initial leasing, if there is any increase in the rent to owner, and at the HAP contract anniversary if there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR in effect 60 days before the HAP contract anniversary. 15 points.</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statements in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section. 0 points.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of adjusted income.</E> (1) This indicator shows whether, at the time of admission and annual reexamination, the PHA verifies and correctly determines adjusted annual income for each assisted family and, where the family is responsible for utilities under the lease, the PHA uses the appropriate utility allowances for the unit leased in determining the gross rent. (24 CFR part 5, subpart F and 24 CFR 982.516)</P>
              <P>(2) HUD verification method: The IA annual audit report covering the PHA fiscal year entered on the SEMAP certification and on-site confirmatory review if performed.</P>
              <P>(3) Rating: (i) The PHA's SEMAP certification states that, based on the PHA's quality control sample of tenant files, for at least 90 percent of families:</P>
              <P>(A) The PHA obtains third party verification of reported family annual income, the value of assets totalling more than $5,000, expenses related to deductions from annual income, and other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income, and uses the verified information in determining adjusted income, and/or documents tenant files to show why third party verification was not available;</P>
              <P>(B) The PHA properly attributes and calculates allowances for any medical, child care, and/or disability assistance expenses; and</P>
              <P>(C) The PHA uses the appropriate utility allowances to determine gross rent for the unit leased. 20 points.</P>
              <P>(ii) The PHA's SEMAP certification includes the statements in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, except that the PHA obtains and uses independent verification of income, properly attributes allowances, and uses the appropriate utility allowances for only 80 to 89 percent of families. 15 points.</P>
              <P>(iii) The PHA's SEMAP certification does not support the statements in either paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (c)(3)(ii) of this section. 0 points.</P>

Submission of deconcentration data for this indicator is optional for all other PHAs. Additional SEMAP points are available to PHAs that have jurisdiction in metropolitan FMR areas and that choose to submit with their SEMAP certifications certain data, in a HUD-prescribed format, on the percent of their tenant-based Section 8 families with children who live in, and who have moved during the PHA fiscal year to, low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area. For purposes of this indicator, the PHA's principal operating area is the geographic entity for which the Census tabulates data that most closely <PRTPAGE P="641"/>matches the PHA's geographic jurisdiction under State or local law (e.g., city, county, metropolitan statistical area) as determined by the PHA, subject to HUD review. A low poverty census tract is defined as a census tract where the poverty rate of the tract is at or below 10 percent, or at or below the overall poverty rate for the principal operating area of the PHA, whichever is greater. The PHA determines the overall poverty rate for its principal operating area using the most recent available decennial Census data. Family data used for the PHA's analysis must be the same information as reported to MTCS for the PHA's tenant-based Section 8 families with children. If HUD determines that the quantity of MTCS data is insufficient for adequate analysis, HUD will not award points under this bonus indicator. Bonus points will be awarded if:</P>
              <P>(i) Half or more of all Section 8 families with children assisted by the PHA in its principal operating area at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year reside in low poverty census tracts;</P>
              <P>(ii) The percent of Section 8 mover families with children who moved to low poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area during the last completed PHA fiscal year is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who reside in low poverty census tracts at the end of the last completed PHA fiscal year; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The percent of Section 8 families with children who moved to low-poverty census tracts in the PHA's principal operating area over the last two completed PHA fiscal years is at least 2 percentage points higher than the percent of all Section 8 families with children who resided in low poverty census tracts at the end of the second to last completed PHA fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(iv) State and regional PHAs that provide Section 8 rental assistance in more than one metropolitan area within a State or region make these determinations separately for each metropolitan area or portion of a metropolitan area where the PHA has assisted at least 20 Section 8 families with children in the last completed PHA fiscal year.</P>

              <P>(2) Notwithstanding an PHA's SEMAP score, if the latest IA report submitted for the PHA under the Single Audit Act indicates that the auditor is unable to provide an opinion as to whether the PHA's financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals, or an opinion that the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, the PHA will automatically be given an overall performance rating of troubled and the PHA will be subject to the requirements at § 985.107.</P>
              <P>(3) When HUD modifies or withholds a rating for any reason, it shall explain in writing to the PHA the reasons for the modification or for withholding the rating.</P>

              <P>This part implements section 9(f) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), (42 U.S.C. 1437g). Section 9(f) establishes an Operating Fund for the purposes of making assistance available to public housing agencies (PHAs) for the operation and management of public housing. In the case of unsubsidized housing, the total expenses of operating rental housing should be covered by the operating income, which primarily consists of rental income and, to some degree, investment and non-rental income. In the case of public housing, the Operating Fund provides operating subsidy to assist PHAs to serve low, very low, and extremely low-income families. This part describes the policies and procedures for Operating Fund formula calculations and management under the Operating Fund Program.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General formula.</E> (1) The amount of annual contributions (operating subsidy) each PHA is eligible to receive under this part shall be determined by a formula.</P>
              <P>(2) In general, operating subsidy shall be the difference between formula expense and formula income. If a PHA's formula expense is greater than its formula income, then the PHA is eligible for an operating subsidy.</P>
              <P>(3) Formula expense is an estimate of a PHA's operating expense and is determined by the following three components: Project Expense Level (PEL), Utility Expense Level (UEL), and other formula expenses (add-ons). Formula expense and its three components are further described in subpart C of this part. Formula income is an estimate for a PHA's non-operating subsidy revenue and is further described in subpart D of this part.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Overview of calculating formula expenses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Formula expenses represent the costs of services and materials needed by a well-run PHA to sustain the project. These costs include items such as administration, maintenance, and utilities. HUD also determines a PHA's formula expenses at a project level. HUD uses the following three factors to determine the overall formula expense level for each project:</P>
              <P>(1)The project expense level (PEL) (calculated in accordance with § 990.165);</P>
              <P>(2) The utilities expense level (UEL) (calculated in accordance with §§ 990.170, 990.175, 990.180, and 990.185); and</P>
              <P>(3)Other formula expenses (add-ons) (calculated in accordance with § 990.190).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">PEL, UEL, and Add-ons.</E> Each project of a PHA has a unique PEL and UEL. The PEL for each project is based on ten characteristics and certain adjustments described in § 990.165. The PEL represents the normal expenses of operating public housing projects, such as maintenance and administration costs. The UEL for each project represents utility expenses. Utility expense levels are based on an incentive system aimed at reducing utility expenses. Both the PEL and UEL are expressed in PUM costs. The expenses not included in these expense levels and which are unique to PHAs are titled “other formula expenses (add-ons)” and are expressed in a dollar amount.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Calculating project formula expense.</E> The formula expense of any one project is the sum of the project's PEL and the UEL, multiplied by the total EUMs specific to the project, plus the add-ons.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of project expense level (PEL).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Computation of PEL.</E> The PEL is calculated in terms of PUM cost and represents the costs associated with the project, except for utility and add-on costs. Costs associated with the PEL are administration, management fees, maintenance, protective services, leasing, occupancy, staffing, and other expenses, such as project insurance. HUD will calculate the PEL using regression analysis and benchmarking for the actual costs of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) projects to estimate costs for public housing projects. HUD will use the ten variables described in paragraph (b) of this section and their associated coefficient (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, values that are expressed in percentage terms) to produce a PEL.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Variables.</E> The ten variables are:</P>
              <P>(1) Size of project (number of units);</P>
              <P>(2) Age of property (Date of Full Availability (DOFA));</P>
              <P>(3) Bedroom mix;</P>
              <P>(4) Building type;</P>
              <P>(5) Occupancy type (family or senior);</P>
              <P>(6) Location (an indicator of the type of community in which a property is located; location types include rural, city central metropolitan, and non-city central metropolitan (suburban) areas);</P>
              <P>(7) Neighborhood poverty rate;</P>
              <P>(8) Percent of households assisted;</P>
              <P>(9) Ownership type (profit, non-profit, or limited dividend); and</P>
              <P>(10) Geographic.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cost adjustments.</E> HUD will apply four adjustments to the PEL. The adjustments are:<PRTPAGE P="653"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) Application of a $200 PUM floor for any senior property and a $215 PUM floor for any family property;</P>
              <P>(2) Application of a $420 PUM ceiling for any property except for New York City Housing Authority projects, which have a $480 PUM ceiling;</P>
              <P>(3) Application of a four percent reduction for any PEL calculated over $325 PUM, with the reduction limited so that a PEL will not be reduced to less than $325; and</P>
              <P>(4) The reduction of audit costs as reported for FFY 2003 in a PUM amount.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Annual inflation factor.</E> The PEL for each project shall be adjusted annually, beginning in 2005, by the local inflation factor. The local inflation factor shall be the HUD-determined weighted average percentage increase in local government wages and salaries for the area in which the PHA is located, and non-wage expenses.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Calculating a PEL.</E> To calculate a specific PEL for a given property, the sum of the coefficients for nine variables (all variables except ownership type) shall be added to a formula constant. The exponent of that sum shall be multiplied by a percentage to reflect the non-profit ownership type, which will produce an unadjusted PEL. For the calculation of the initial PEL, the cost adjustments described in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section will be applied. After these initial adjustments are applied, the audit adjustment described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section will be applied to arrive at the PEL in year 2000 dollars. After the PEL in year 2000 dollars is created, the annual inflation factor as described in paragraph (d) of this section will be applied cumulatively to this number through 2004 to yield an initial PEL in terms of current dollars.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Calculation of the PEL for Moving to Work PHAs.</E> PHAs participating in the Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration authorized under section 204 of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134, approved April 26, 1996) shall receive an operating subsidy as provided in Attachment A of their MTW Agreements executed prior to November 18, 2005.

              <SUBJECT>Computation of utilities expense level (UEL): Overview.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The UEL for each PHA is based on its consumption for each utility, the applicable rates for each utility, and an applicable inflation factor. The UEL for a given funding period is the product of the utility rate multiplied by the payable consumption level multiplied by the inflation factor. The UEL is expressed in terms of PUM costs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Utility rate.</E> The utility rate for each type of utility will be the actual average rate from the most recent 12-month period that ended June 30th prior to the beginning of the applicable funding period. The rate will be calculated by dividing the actual utility cost by the actual utility consumption, with consideration for pass-through costs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, state and local utility taxes, tariffs) for the time period specified in this paragraph.<PRTPAGE P="654"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payable consumption level.</E> The payable consumption level is based on the current consumption level adjusted by a utility consumption incentive. The incentive shall be computed by comparing current consumption levels of each utility to the rolling base consumption level. If the comparison reflects a decrease in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall retain 75 percent of this decrease. Alternately, if the comparison reflects an increase in the consumption of a utility, the PHA shall absorb 75 percent of this increase.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Inflation factor for utilities.</E> The UEL shall be adjusted annually by an inflation/deflation factor based upon the fuels and utilities component of the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The annual adjustment to the UEL shall reflect the most recently published and localized data available from BLS at the time the annual adjustment is calculated.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Increases in tenant utility allowances.</E> Increases in tenant utility allowances, as a component of the formula income, as described in § 990.195, shall result in a commensurate increase of operating subsidy. Decreases in such utility allowances shall result in a commensurate decrease in operating subsidy.</P>

              <P>(3) HUD will notify each PHA when HUD has the automated systems capacity to receive such information. Each PHA then will be obligated to provide consumption and cost data to HUD for all utilities for each project.</P>
              <P>(4) If a PHA has not maintained or cannot recapture utility data from its records for a particular utility, the PHA shall compute the UEL by:</P>
              <P>(i) Using actual consumption data for the last complete year(s) of available data or data of comparable project(s) that have comparable utility delivery systems and occupancy, in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Requesting field office approval to use actual PUM utility expenses for its UEL in accordance with a method prescribed by HUD when the PHA cannot obtain necessary data to calculate the UEL in accordance with paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Utilities expense level: Incentives for energy conservation/rate reduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General/consumption reduction.</E> If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD, the PHA may qualify for the incentives available under this section. For a PHA to qualify for these incentives, the PHA must enter into a contract to finance the energy conservation measures, and must obtain HUD approval. Such approval shall be based on a determination that payments under a contract can be funded from reasonably anticipated energy cost savings. The contract period shall not exceed 20 years. The energy conservation measures may include, but are not limited to: Physical improvements financed by a loan from a bank, utility, or governmental entity; management of costs under the performance contract; or a shared savings agreement with a private energy service company. All such contracts shall be known as energy performance contracts. PHAs may extend an executed energy performance contract with a term of less than 20 years to a term of not more than 20 years, to permit additional energy conservation improvements without the reprocurement of energy performance contractors. The PHA must obtain HUD approval to extend the term of an executed energy performance contract.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Frozen rolling base.</E> (i) If a PHA undertakes energy conservation measures that are approved by HUD, the RBCL for the project and the utilities involved may be frozen during the contract period. Before the RBCL is frozen, it must be adjusted to reflect any energy savings resulting from the use of any HUD funding. The RBCL also may be adjusted to reflect systems repaired to meet applicable building and safety codes as well as to reflect adjustments for occupancy rates increased by rehabilitation. The RBCL shall be frozen at the level calculated for the year during which the conservation measures initially shall be implemented.</P>

              <P>(ii) The PHA operating subsidy eligibility shall reflect the retention of 100 percent of the savings from decreased consumption until the term of the financing agreement is complete. The PHA must use at least 75 percent of the cost savings to pay off the debt, <E T="03">e.g.</E>, pay off the contractor or bank loan. If less than 75 percent of the cost savings is used for debt payment, however, HUD shall retain the difference between the actual percentage of cost savings used to pay off the debt and 75 percent of the cost savings. If at least 75 percent of the cost savings is paid to the contractor or bank, the PHA may use the full amount of the remaining cost savings for any eligible operating expense.</P>
              <P>(iii) The annual three-year rolling base procedures for computing the RBCL shall be reactivated after the PHA satisfies the conditions of the contract. The three years of consumption data to be used in calculating the RBCL after the end of the contract period shall be the yearly consumption levels for the final three years of the contract.</P>
              <P>(2) PHAs undertaking energy conservation measures that are financed by an entity other than HUD may include resident-paid utilities under the consumption reduction incentive, using the following methodology:</P>
              <P>(i) The PHA reviews and updates all utility allowances to ascertain that residents are receiving the proper allowances before energy savings measures are begun;</P>

              <P>(ii) The PHA makes future calculations of rental income for purposes of the calculation of operating subsidy eligibility based on these baseline allowances. In effect, HUD will freeze the baseline allowances for the duration of the contract;<PRTPAGE P="656"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) After implementation of the energy conservation measures, the PHA updates the utility allowances in accordance with provisions in 24 CFR part 965, subpart E. The new allowance should be lower than baseline allowances;</P>
              <P>(iv) The PHA uses at least 75 percent of the savings for paying the cost of the improvement (the PHA will be permitted to retain 100 percent of the difference between the baseline allowances and revised allowances);</P>
              <P>(v) After the completion of the contract period, the PHA begins using the revised allowances in calculating its operating subsidy eligibility; and</P>
              <P>(vi) The PHA may exclude from its calculation of rental income the increased rental income due to the difference between the baseline allowances and the revised allowances of the projects involved, for the duration of the contract period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Subsidy add-on.</E> (i) If a PHA qualifies for this incentive (i.e., the subsidy add-on, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section), then the PHA is eligible for additional operating subsidy each year of the contract to amortize the cost of the loan for the energy conservation measures and other direct costs related to the energy project under the contract during the term of the contract subject to the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The PHA's operating subsidy for the current funding year will continue to be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 990.170 (<E T="03">i.e.</E>, the rolling base is not frozen). The PHA will be able to retain part of the cost savings in accordance with § 990.170(c).</P>
              <P>(ii) The actual cost of energy (of the type affected by the energy conservation measure) after implementation of the energy conservation measure will be subtracted from the expected energy cost, to produce the energy cost savings for the year.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the cost savings for any year during the contract period are less than the amount of operating subsidy to be made available under this paragraph to pay for the energy conservation measure in that year, the deficiency will be offset against the PHA's operating subsidy eligibility for the PHA's next fiscal year.</P>
              <P>(iv) If energy cost savings are less than the amount necessary to meet amortization payments specified in a contract, the contract term may be extended (up to the 20-year limit) if HUD determines that the shortfall is the result of changed circumstances, rather than a miscalculation or misrepresentation of projected energy savings by the contractor or PHA. The contract term may be extended only to accommodate payment to the contractor and associated direct costs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Rate reduction.</E> If a PHA takes action beyond normal public participation in rate-making proceedings, such as well-head purchase of natural gas, administrative appeals, or legal action to reduce the rate it pays for utilities, then the PHA will be permitted to retain one-half the annual savings realized from these actions.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Utility benchmarking.</E> HUD will pursue benchmarking utility consumption at the project level as part of the transition to asset management. HUD intends to establish benchmarks by collecting utility consumption and cost information on a project-by-project basis. In 2009, after conducting a feasibility study, HUD will convene a meeting with representation of appropriate stakeholders to review utility benchmarking options so that HUD may determine whether or how to implement utility benchmarking to be effective in FY 2011. The meeting shall be convened in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix) (FACA). The HUD study shall take into account typical levels of utilities consumption at public housing developments based upon factors such as building and unit type and size, temperature zones, age and construction of building, and other relevant factors.</P>

              <P>In addition to calculating operating subsidy based on the PEL and UEL, a PHA's eligible formula expenses shall be increased by add-ons. The allowed add-ons are:<PRTPAGE P="657"/>
              </P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Self-sufficiency.</E> A PHA may request operating subsidy for the reasonable cost of program coordinator(s) and associated costs in accordance with HUD's self-sufficiency program regulations and notices.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Energy loan amortization.</E> A PHA may qualify for operating subsidy for payments of principal and interest cost for energy conservation measures described in § 990.185(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT).</E> Each PHA will receive an amount for PILOT in accordance with section 6(d) of the 1937 Act, based on its cooperation agreement or its latest actual PILOT payment.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Cost of independent audits.</E> A PHA is eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs for the Operating Fund Program when an audit is required by the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) (see 2 CFR part 200, subpart F) or when a PHA elects to prepare and submit such an audit to HUD. For the purpose of this rule, the most recent actual audit costs include the associated costs of an audit for the Operating Fund Program only. A PHA whose operating subsidy is determined to be zero based on the formula is still eligible to receive operating subsidy equal to its most recent actual audit costs. The most recent actual audit costs are used as a proxy to cover the cost of the next audit. If a PHA does not have a recent actual audit cost, the PHA working with HUD may establish an audit cost. A PHA that requests funding for an audit shall complete an audit. The results of the audit shall be transmitted in a time and manner prescribed by HUD.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Funding for resident participation activities.</E> Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $25 per occupied unit per year for resident participation activities, including, but not limited to, those described in 24 CFR part 964. For purposes of this section, a unit is eligible to receive resident participation funding if it is occupied by a public housing resident or it is occupied by a PHA employee, or a police officer or other security personnel who is not otherwise eligible for public housing. In any fiscal year, if appropriations are not sufficient to meet all funding requirements under this part, then the resident participation component of the formula will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Asset management fee.</E> Each PHA with at least 250 units shall receive a $4 PUM asset management fee. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to transition to asset management shall receive an asset management fee of $2 PUM. PHAs with fewer than 250 units that elect to have their entire portfolio treated and considered as a single project as described in § 990.260(b) or PHAs with only one project will not be eligible for an asset management fee. For all PHAs eligible to receive the asset management fee, the fee will be based on the total number of ACC units. PHAs that are not in compliance with asset management as described in subpart H of this part by FY 2011 will forfeit this fee.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Information technology fee.</E> Each PHA's operating subsidy calculation shall include $2 PUM for costs attributable to information technology. For all PHAs, this fee will be based on the total number of ACC units.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Asset repositioning fee.</E> (1) A PHA that transitions projects or entire buildings of a project out of its inventory is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee. This fee supplements the costs associated with administration and management of demolition or disposition, tenant relocation, and minimum protection and service associated with such efforts. The asset-repositioning fee is not intended for individual units within a multi-unit building undergoing similar activities.</P>
              <P>(2) Projects covered by applications approved for demolition or disposition shall be eligible for an asset repositioning fee on the first day of the next quarter six months after the date the first unit becomes vacant after the relocation date included in the approved relocation plan. When this condition is met, the project and all associated units are no longer considered an EUM as described in § 990.155. Each PHA is responsible for accurately applying and maintaining supporting documentation on the start date of this transition period or is subject to forfeiture of this add-on.</P>

              <P>(3) Units categorized for demolition and which are eligible for an asset <PRTPAGE P="658"/>repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months, 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months, and 25 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.</P>
              <P>(4) Units categorized for disposition and which are eligible for an asset repositioning fee are eligible for operating subsidy at the rate of 75 percent PEL per unit for the first twelve months and 50 percent PEL per unit for the next twelve months.</P>
              <P>(5) The following is an example of how eligibility for an asset-repositioning fee is determined:</P>
              <P>(i) A PHA has HUD's approval to demolish (or dispose of) a 100-unit project from its 1,000 unit inventory. On January 12th, in conjunction with the PHA's approved Relocation Plan, a unit in that project becomes vacant. Accordingly, the demolition/disposition-approved project is eligible for an asset-repositioning fee on October 1st. (This date is calculated as follows: January 12th + six months = July 12th. The first day of the next quarter is October 1st.)</P>
              <P>(ii) Although payment of the asset-repositioning fee will not begin until October 1st, the PHA will receive its full operating subsidy based on the 1,000 units through September 30th. On October 1st the PHA will begin to receive the 36-month asset-repositioning fee in accordance with paragraph (h)(3) of this section for the 100 units approved for demolition. (Asset repositioning fee requirements for projects approved for disposition are found in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.) On October 1st, the PHA's units will be 900.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Costs attributable to changes in Federal law, regulation, or economy.</E> In the event that HUD determines that enactment of a Federal law or revision in HUD or other Federal regulations has caused or will cause a significant change in expenditures of a continuing nature above the PEL and UEL, HUD may, at HUD's sole discretion, decide to prescribe a procedure under which the PHA may apply for or may receive an adjustment in operating subsidy.</P>

              <P>This policy is aimed at assisting all PHAs in transitioning to the new funding levels as determined by the formula set forth in this rule. PHAs will be subject to a transition funding policy that will either increase or reduce their total operating subsidy for a given year.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Transition determination.</SUBJECT>

              <P>The determination of the amount and period of the transition funding shall be based on the difference in subsidy levels between the formula set forth in this part and the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula set forth in this part. The difference in subsidy levels will be calculated using FY 2004 data. When actual data are not available for one of the formula components needed to calculate the formula of this part for FY 2004, HUD will use alternate data as a substitute (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, unit months available for eligible unit months, etc.) If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA shall have its operating subsidy reduced as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to a transition policy as indicated in § 990.230. If the difference between these formulas indicates that a PHA will have its operating subsidy increased as a result of this formula, the PHA will be subject to the transition policy as indicated in § 990.235.</P>

              <SUBJECT>PHAs that will experience a subsidy reduction.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For PHAs that will experience a reduction in their operating subsidy, as determined in § 990.225, such reductions will have a limit of:</P>
              <P>(1) 5 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the first year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;</P>
              <P>(2) 24 percent of the difference between the two funding levels in the second year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;</P>
              <P>(3) 43 percent of the difference between the two levels in the third year of implementation of the formula contained in this part;</P>
              <P>(4) 62 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fourth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part; and</P>
              <P>(5) 81 percent of the difference between the two levels in the fifth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The full amount of the reduction in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the sixth year of implementation of the formula contained in this part.</P>

              <P>(c) For example, a PHA has a subsidy reduction from $1 million, under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part, to $900,000, under the formula contained in this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million − $900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy reduction would be limited to $5,000 (5 <PRTPAGE P="661"/>percent of the difference). Thus, the PHA would receive an operating subsidy amount pursuant to this rule plus a transition-funding amount of $95,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $5,000 reduction limit).</P>
              <P>(d) If a PHA can demonstrate a successful conversion to the asset management requirements of subpart H of this part, as determined under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will discontinue the reduction at the PHA's next subsidy calculation following such demonstration, as reflected in the schedule in paragraph (e) of this section, notwithstanding § 990.290(c).</P>

              <P>(b) The full amount of the increase in the operating subsidy level shall be realized in the second year following implementation of the formula contained in this part.</P>

              <P>(c) For example, a PHA's subsidy increased from $900,000 under the formula in effect prior to implementation of the formula contained in this part to $1 million under the formula contained in <PRTPAGE P="662"/>this part using FY 2004 data. The difference would be calculated at $100,000 ($1 million−$900,000 = $100,000). In the first year, the subsidy increase would be limited to $50,000 (50 percent of the difference). Thus, in this example the PHA will receive the operating subsidy amount of this rule minus a transition-funding amount of $50,000 (the $100,000 difference between the two subsidy amounts minus the $50,000 transition amount).</P>

              <P>(2) Provided that the PHA complies with GAAP and other associated laws and regulations pertaining to financial management (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> 2 CFR part 200it shall have the maximum amount of responsibility and flexibility in implementing project-based accounting.</P>
              <P>(3) Project-specific operating income shall include, but is not limited to, such items as project-specific operating subsidy, dwelling and non-dwelling rental income, excess utilities income, and other PHA or HUD-identified income that is project-specific for management purposes.</P>
              <P>(4) Project-specific operating expenses shall include, but are not limited to, direct administrative costs, utilities costs, maintenance costs, tenant services, protective services, general expenses, non-routine or capital expenses, and other PHA or HUD-identified costs which are project-specific for management purposes. Project-specific operating costs also shall include a property management fee charged to each project that is used to fund operations of the central office. Amounts that can be charged to each project for the property management fee must be reasonable. If the PHA contracts with a private management company to manage a project, the PHA may use the difference between the property management fee paid to the private management company and the fee that is reasonable to fund operations of the central office and other eligible purposes.</P>
              <P>(5) If the project has excess cash flow available after meeting all reasonable operating needs of the property, the PHA may use this excess cash flow for the following purposes:</P>
              <P>(i) Fungibility between projects as provided for in § 990.205.</P>
              <P>(ii) Charging each project a reasonable asset management fee that may also be used to fund operations of the central office. However, this asset management fee may be charged only if the PHA performs all asset management activities described in this subpart (including project-based management, budgeting, and accounting). Asset management fees are considered a direct expense.</P>
              <P>(iii) Other eligible purposes.</P>

              <P>(c) In addition to project-specific records, PHAs may establish central office cost centers to account for non-project specific costs (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, human resources, Executive Director's office, etc.). These costs shall be funded from the property-management fees received from each property, and from the asset management fees to the extent these are available.</P>

              <P>(d) In the case where a PHA chooses to centralize functions that directly support a project (<E T="03">e.g.</E>, central maintenance), it must charge each project using a fee-for-service approach. Each project shall be charged for the actual services received and only to the extent that such amounts are reasonable.</P>

              <P>(a) The RMC and the PHA must submit operating budgets and calculations of operating subsidy to HUD for approval in accordance with § 990.200. The <PRTPAGE P="666"/>budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify the expenditures related to the responsibilities of the RMC and the expenditures that are related to the functions that the PHA will continue to perform.</P>
              <P>(b) For each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the RMC, the PHA will transfer into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the PHA an operating reserve for the RMC project. When all maintenance responsibilities for a resident-managed project are the responsibility of the RMC, the amount of the reserve made available to a project under this subpart will be the per-unit cost amount available to the PHA operating reserve, excluding all inventories, prepaids, and receivables at the end of the PHA fiscal year preceding implementation, multiplied by the number of units in the project operated. When some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the RMC, the management contract between the PHA and RMC may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the RMC's sub-account.</P>
              <P>(c) The RMC's use of the operating reserve is subject to all administrative procedures applicable to the conventionally owned public housing program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve must be for eligible expenditures that are incorporated into an operating budget subject to approval by HUD.</P>
              <P>(d) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with HUD regulations and guidance.</P>

              <P>(2) The funds the PHA provides to the RMC.</P>
              <P>(b) The RMC's management contract must specify the amount of income that is expected to be derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges) and the amount of income to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the PHA (such as operating subsidy under this part, interest income, administrative fees, and rents). These income estimates must be calculated consistent with HUD's administrative instructions.

              <P>Under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4101 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (NAHASDA) the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides grants, loan guarantees, and technical assistance to Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages for the development and operation of low-income housing in Indian areas. The policies and procedures described in this part apply to grants to eligible recipients under the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program for Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages. This part also applies to loan guarantee assistance under title VI of NAHASDA. The regulations in this part supplement the statutory requirements set forth in NAHASDA. This part, as much as practicable, does not repeat statutory language.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What are the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Secretary shall use the following Congressional findings set forth in section 2 of NAHASDA as the guiding principles in the implementation of NAHASDA:</P>
              <P>(1) The Federal government has a responsibility to promote the general welfare of the Nation:</P>
              <P>(i) By using Federal resources to aid families and individuals seeking affordable homes in safe and healthy environments and, in particular, assisting responsible, deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their control;</P>
              <P>(ii) By working to ensure a thriving national economy and a strong private housing market; and</P>
              <P>(iii) By developing effective partnerships among the Federal government, state, tribal, and local governments, and private entities that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day activities.</P>
              <P>(2) There exists a unique relationship between the Government of the United States and the governments of Indian tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people.</P>
              <P>(3) The Constitution of the United States invests the Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs, and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and Indian people.</P>
              <P>(4) The Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed a trust responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian tribes and for working with Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status so that they are able to take greater responsibility for their own economic condition.</P>
              <P>(5) Providing affordable homes in safe and healthy environments is an essential element in the special role of the United States in helping Indian tribes and their members to improve their housing conditions and socioeconomic status.</P>

              <P>(6) The need for affordable homes in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan villages <PRTPAGE P="672"/>is acute and the federal government shall work not only to provide housing assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in the development of private housing finance mechanisms on Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-sufficiency and self-determination for Indian tribes and their members.</P>

              <P>(7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities shall be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance by making such assistance available directly to the Indian tribes or tribally designated entities under authorities similar to those accorded Indian tribes in Public Law 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed as releasing the United States government from any responsibility arising under its trust responsibilities towards Indians or any treaty or treaties with an Indian tribe or nation.</P>

              <P>The primary objectives of NAHASDA are:</P>
              <P>(a) To assist and promote affordable housing activities to develop, maintain and operate affordable housing in safe and healthy environments on Indian reservations and in other Indian areas for occupancy by low-income Indian families;</P>
              <P>(b) To ensure better access to private mortgage markets for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;</P>
              <P>(c) To coordinate activities to provide housing for Indian tribes and their members and to promote self-sufficiency of Indian tribes and their members;</P>
              <P>(d) To plan for and integrate infrastructure resources for Indian tribes with housing development for Indian tribes; and</P>
              <P>(e) To promote the development of private capital markets in Indian country and to allow such markets to operate and grow, thereby benefiting Indian communities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What is the nature of the IHBG program?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The IHBG program is formula driven whereby eligible recipients of funding receive an equitable share of appropriations made by the Congress, based upon formula components specified under subpart D of this part. IHBG recipients must have the administrative capacity to undertake the affordable housing activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.</P>

              <P>The negotiated rulemaking procedures and requirements set out in section 106(b) of NAHASDA shall be conducted as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Committee membership.</E> In forming a negotiated rulemaking committee, HUD shall appoint as committee members representatives of the Federal Government and representatives of diverse tribes and program recipients.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Initiation of rulemaking.</E> HUD shall initiate a negotiated rulemaking not later than 90 days after the enactment of any act to reauthorize or significantly amend NAHASDA.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Work groups.</E> Negotiated rulemaking committees may form workgroups made up of committee members and other interested parties to meet during committee sessions and between sessions to develop specific rulemaking proposals for committee consideration.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Further review.</E> Negotiated rulemaking committees shall provide recommended rules to HUD. Once rules are proposed by HUD, they shall be published for comment in the <E T="04">Federal <PRTPAGE P="673"/>Register.</E> Any comments will be further reviewed by the committee and HUD before HUD determines if the rule or rules will be adopted.</P>

              <P>(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the recipient from accepting a donation or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value.</P>
              <P>(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property if the proposed acquisition payment exceeds the fair market value. The recipient shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and a justification for the proposed acquisition payment. HUD will promptly review the proposal and inform the recipient of its approval or disapproval.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Minimize displacement.</E> Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, recipients shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under this part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants and homebuyers who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the <PRTPAGE P="676"/>project. Such residential tenants and homebuyers shall be provided:</P>
              <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly housing costs (e.g., rent/utility costs).</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the repairs; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals to the recipient.</E> A person who disagrees with the recipient's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the recipient.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Responsibility of recipient.</E> (1) The recipient shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The recipient shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the recipient to comply with the provisions in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the recipient from any other source.</P>
              <P>(3) The recipient shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an IHP that is later approved.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, that the recipient determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</P>
              <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the agreement between the recipient and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or</P>
              <P>(B) 30 percent of gross household income.</P>
              <P>(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</P>

              <P>(A) The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from <PRTPAGE P="677"/>the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or</P>
              <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>
              <P>(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
              <P>(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the IHP to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project.</P>
              <P>(ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) The recipient determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.</P>
              <P>(3) A recipient may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition (See 49 CFR part 24).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What labor standards are applicable?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Davis-Bacon wage rates.</E> (1) As described in section 104(b) of NAHASDA, contracts and agreements for assistance, sale, or lease under NAHASDA must require prevailing wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-44, 3146, and 3147) to be paid to laborers and mechanics employed in the development of affordable housing.</P>
              <P>(2) When NAHASDA assistance is only used to assist homebuyers to acquire single family housing, the Davis-Bacon wage rates apply to the construction of the housing if there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that NAHASDA assistance will be used to assist homebuyers to buy the housing.</P>
              <P>(3) Prime contracts not in excess of $2000 are exempt from Davis-Bacon wage rates.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">HUD-determined wage rates.</E> Section 104(b) also mandates that contracts and agreements for assistance, sale or lease under NAHASDA require that prevailing wages determined or adopted (subsequent to a determination under applicable state, tribal or local law) by HUD shall be paid to maintenance laborers and mechanics employed in the operation, and to architects, technical engineers, draftsmen and technicians employed in the development, of affordable housing.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.</E> Contracts in excess of $100,000 to which Davis-Bacon or HUD-determined wage rates apply are subject by law to the overtime provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701).</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Volunteers.</E> The requirements in 24 CFR part 70 concerning exemptions for the use of volunteers on projects subject to Davis-Bacon and HUD-determined wage rates are applicable.</P>

Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall also not apply to work performed directly by tribal or TDHE employees under a contract or agreement for assistance, sale, or lease, that is covered by one or more such laws or regulations adopted by an Indian tribe.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Other laws and issuances.</E> Recipients, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations issued under the labor standards provisions cited in this section, other applicable Federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards, and HUD Handbook 1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What environmental review requirements apply?</SUBJECT>
              <P>The environmental effects of each activity carried out with assistance under this part must be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321) and the related authorities listed in HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR parts 50 and 58.

              <SUBJECT>Is an Indian tribe required to assume environmental review responsibilities?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) No. It is an option an Indian tribe may choose. If an Indian tribe declines to assume the environmental review responsibilities, HUD will perform the environmental review in accordance with 24 CFR part 50. The timing of HUD undertaking the environmental review will be subject to the availability of resources. A HUD environmental review must be completed for any NAHASDA assisted activities not excluded from review under 24 CFR 50.19(b) before a recipient may acquire, rehabilitate, convert, lease, repair or construct property, or commit HUD or local funds used in conjunction with such NAHASDA assisted activities with respect to the property.</P>
              <P>(b) If an Indian tribe assumes environmental review responsibilities:</P>
              <P>(1) Its certifying officer must certify that he/she is authorized and consents on behalf of the Indian tribe and such officer to accept the jurisdiction of the Federal courts for the purpose of enforcement of the responsibilities of the certifying officer as set forth in section 105(c) of NAHASDA; and</P>
              <P>(2) The Indian tribe must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 58.</P>
              <P>(3) No funds may be committed to a grant activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification required by sections 105(b) and 105(c) of NAHASDA, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58 such as for the costs of environmental reviews and other planning and administrative expenses.</P>
              <P>(c) Where an environmental assessment (EA) is appropriate under 24 CFR part 50, instead of an Indian tribe assuming environmental review responsibilities under paragraph (b) of this section or HUD preparing the EA itself under paragraph (a) of this section, an Indian tribe or TDHE may prepare an EA for HUD review. In addition to complying with the requirements of 40 CFR 1506.5(a), HUD shall make its own evaluation of the environmental issues and take responsibility for the scope and content of the EA in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5(b).</P>

Such persons include anyone with an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement or proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or others with whom they have business or immediate family ties. Immediate family ties are determined by the Indian tribe or TDHE in its operating policies.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Under what conditions may non-low-income Indian families participate in the program?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A family that was low-income at the times described in § 1000.147 but subsequently becomes a non-low-income family due to an increase in income may continue to participate in the program in accordance with the recipient's admission and occupancy policies. The 10 percent limitation in paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply to such families. Such families may be made subject to the additional requirements in paragraph (d) of this section based on those policies. This includes a family member or household member who takes ownership of a homeownership unit under § 1000.146.</P>
              <P>(b) A recipient must determine and document that there is a need for housing for each family that cannot reasonably be met without such assistance.</P>
              <P>(c) A recipient may use up to 10 percent of the amount planned for the tribal program year for families whose income falls within 80 to 100 percent of the median income without HUD approval. HUD approval is required if a recipient plans to use more than 10 percent of the amount planned for the tribal program year for such assistance or to provide housing for families with income over 100 percent of median income.</P>
              <P>(d) Non-low-income families cannot receive the same benefits provided low-income Indian families. The amount of assistance non-low-income families may receive will be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) The rent (including homebuyer payments under a lease purchase agreement) to be paid by a non-low-income family cannot be less than: (Income of non-low-income family/Income of family at 80 percent of median income) × (Rental payment of family at 80 percent of median income), but need not exceed the fair market rent or value of the unit.</P>
              <P>(2) Other assistance, including down payment assistance, to non-low-income families, cannot exceed: (Income of family at 80 percent of median income/Income of non-low-income family) × (Present value of the assistance provided to family at 80 percent of median income).</P>
              <P>(e) The requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply to non-low-income families that the recipient has determined to be essential under § 1000.106(b).</P>

              <P>(1) A financial analysis demonstrates that it is more cost-effective or housing program-effective for the recipient to demolish or dispose of the unit than to continue to operate or own it; or</P>

              <P>Yes. Affordable housing must be of moderate design. For these purposes, moderate design is defined as housing that is of a size and with amenities consistent with unassisted housing offered for sale in the Indian tribe's general geographic area to buyers who are at or below the area median income. The local determination of moderate design applies to all housing assisted under an affordable housing activity, including development activities (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation of affordable housing and homebuyer assistance) and model activities. Acquisition includes assistance to a family to buy housing. Units with the same number of bedrooms must be comparable with respect to size, cost and amenities.</P>

              <SUBJECT>How will a NAHASDA grant recipient know that the housing assisted under the IHBG program meets the requirements of § 1000.156?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) A recipient must use one of the methods specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if an assisted housing project meets the moderate design requirements of § 1000.156. For purposes of this requirement, a project is one or more housing units, of comparable size, cost, amenities and design, developed with assistance provided by the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) The recipient may adopt written standards for its affordable housing programs that reflect the requirement specified in § 1000.156. The standards must describe the type of housing, explain the basis for the standards, and use similar housing in the Indian tribe's general geographic area. For each affordable housing project, the recipient must maintain documentation substantiating compliance with the adopted housing standards. The standards and documentation substantiating compliance for each activity must be available for review by the general public and, upon request, by HUD. Prior to awarding a contract for the construction of housing or beginning construction using its own workforce, the recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC discussed in paragraph (c) of this section and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed by more than 10 percent the TDC maximum cost for the project. In developing standards under this paragraph, the recipient must establish, maintain, and follow policies that determine a local definition of moderate design which considers:</P>
              <P>(1) Gross area;</P>
              <P>(2) Total cost to provide the housing;</P>
              <P>(3) Environmental concerns and mitigations;</P>
              <P>(4) Climate;</P>
              <P>(5) Comparable housing in geographical area;</P>
              <P>(6) Local codes, ordinances and standards;</P>
              <P>(7) Cultural relevance in design;</P>

              <P>(c) If the recipient has not adopted housing standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, Total Development Cost (TDC) limits published periodically by HUD establish the maximum amount of funds (from all sources) that the recipient may use to develop or acquire/rehabilitate affordable housing. The recipient must complete a comparison of the cost of developing or acquiring/rehabilitating the affordable housing with the limits provided by the TDC and may not, without prior HUD approval, exceed the TDC maximum cost for the project.</P>

The purpose of a non-dwelling structure must be to support an affordable housing activity, as defined by the Act.</P>

              <P>(a) The recipient must use one of the methods described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to determine if a non-dwelling structure meets the limitation requirements of § 1000.160. If the recipient develops, acquires, or rehabilitates a non-dwelling structure with funds from NAHASDA and other sources, then the cost limit standard established under these regulations applies to the entire structure. If funds are used from two different sources, the standards of the funding source with the more restrictive rules apply.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) The recipient may adopt written standards for non-dwelling structures. The standards must describe the type of structures and must clearly describe the criteria to be used to guide the cost, size, design, features, amenities, performance or other factors. The standards for such structures must be able to support the reasonableness and necessity for these factors and to clearly identify the affordable housing activity that is being provided.</P>
              <P>(2) When the recipient applies a standard to particular structures, it must document the following: (i) Identification of targeted population to benefit from the structures;</P>
              <P>(ii) Identification of need or problem to be solved;</P>
              <P>(iii) Affordable housing activity provided or supported by the structures;</P>
              <P>(iv) Alternatives considered;</P>
              <P>(v) Provision for future growth and change;</P>
              <P>(vi) Cultural relevance of design;</P>
              <P>(vii) Size and scope supported by population and need;</P>

              <P>(c) If the recipient has not adopted program standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then it must demonstrate and document that the non-dwelling structure is of a cost, size, design and with amenities consistent with similarly designed and constructed structures in the recipient's general geographic area.</P>

              <P>HUD will conduct the IHP review in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(a) HUD will conduct a limited review of the IHP to ensure that its contents:</P>
              <P>(1) Comply with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA, which outlines the IHP submission requirements; however, the recipient may use either the HUD-estimated IHBG amount or the IHBG amount from their most recent compliant IHP;</P>
              <P>(2) Are consistent with information and data available to HUD;</P>
              <P>(3) Are not prohibited by or inconsistent with any provision of NAHASDA or other applicable law; and</P>
              <P>(4) Include the appropriate certifications.</P>
              <P>(b) If the IHP complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of IHP compliance within 60 days after receiving the IHP. If HUD fails to notify the recipient, the IHP shall be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of section 102 of NAHASDA and the IHP is approved.</P>
              <P>(c) If the submitted IHP does not comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), and (a)(3) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient of the determination of non-compliance. HUD will provide this notice no later than 60 days after receiving the IHP. This notice will set forth:</P>
              <P>(1) The reasons for noncompliance;<PRTPAGE P="697"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The modifications necessary for the IHP to meet the submission requirements; and</P>
              <P>(3) The date by which the revised IHP must be submitted.</P>
              <P>(d) If the recipient does not submit a revised IHP by the date indicated in the notice provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the IHP will be determined by HUD to be in non-compliance unless a waiver is requested and approved under section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the IHP is determined by HUD to be in non-compliance and no waiver is granted, the recipient may appeal this determination following the appeal process in § 1000.234.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) If the IHP does not contain the certifications identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the recipient will be notified within 60 days of submission of the IHP that the plan is incomplete. The notification will include a date by which the certification must be submitted.</P>
              <P>(2) If the recipient has not complied or cannot comply with the certification requirements due to circumstances beyond the control of the Indian tribe(s), within the timeframe established, the recipient can request a waiver in accordance with section 101(b)(2) of NAHASDA. If the waiver is approved, the recipient is eligible to receive its grant in accordance with any conditions of the waiver.</P>

              <P>Yes. Section 103(c) of NAHASDA specifically provides that a recipient may submit modifications or revisions of its IHP to HUD. Unless the initial IHP certification provided by an Indian tribe allowed for the submission of IHP amendments without further tribal certifications, a tribal certification must accompany submission of IHP amendments by a TDHE to HUD. HUD's review of an amendment and determination of compliance will be limited to modifications of an IHP which adds new activities or involve a decrease in the amount of funds provided to protect and maintain the viability of housing assisted under the 1937 Act. HUD will consider these modifications to the IHP in accordance with § 1000.230. HUD will act on amended IHPs within 30 days.</P>

              <P>(a) Yes. Within 30 days of receiving HUD's disapproval of an IHP or of a modification to an IHP, the recipient may submit a written request for reconsideration of the determination. The request shall include the justification for the reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(b) Within 21 days of receiving the request, HUD shall reconsider its initial determination and provide the recipient with written notice of its decision to affirm, modify, or reverse its initial determination. This notice will also contain the reasons for HUD's decision.</P>
              <P>(c) The recipient may appeal any denial of reconsideration by filing an appeal with the Assistant Secretary within 21 days of receiving the denial. The appeal shall set forth the reasons why the recipient does not agree with HUD's decision and include justification for the reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(d) Within 21 days of receipt of the appeal, the Assistant Secretary shall review the recipient's appeal and act on the appeal. The Assistant Secretary will provide written notice to the recipient setting forth the reasons for the decision. The Assistant Secretary's decision constitutes final agency action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What percentage of the IHBG funds can be used for administrative and planning expenses?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Recipients receiving in excess of $500,000 may use up to 20 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or may use up to 20 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. Recipients receiving $500,000 or less may use up to 30 percent of their annual expenditures of grant funds or up to 30 percent of their annual grant amount, whichever is greater. When a recipient is receiving grant funds on behalf of one or more grant beneficiaries, the recipient may use up to 30 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 30 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is $500,000 or less, and up to 20 percent of the annual expenditure of grant funds or up to 20 percent of the annual grant amount, whichever is greater, of each grant beneficiary whose allocation is greater than $500,000. HUD approval is required if a higher percentage is requested by the recipient. Recipients combining grant funds with other funding may request HUD approval to use a higher percentage based on its total expenditure of funds from all sources for that year. When HUD approval is required, HUD must take into consideration any cost of preparing the IHP, challenges to and collection of data, the recipient's grant amount, approved cost allocation plans, and any other relevant information with special consideration given to the circumstances of recipients receiving minimal funding.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Allowable Expense Level (AEL) factor.</E> In rental projects, AEL is the per-unit per-month dollar amount of expenses which was used to compute the amount of operating subsidy used prior to October 1, 1997 for the Low Rent units developed under the 1937 Act. The “AEL factor” is the relative difference between a local area AEL and the national weighted average for AEL.</P>

                <E T="03">Fair Market Rent (FMR) factors</E> are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent plus the cost of all utilities, except telephones. HUD estimates FMRs on an annual basis for 354 metropolitan FMR areas and 2,355 non-metropolitan county FMR areas.

                <E T="03">Formula area.</E> (1) Formula areas are:</P>
              <P>(i) Reservations for federally recognized Indian tribes, as defined by the U.S. Census;</P>
              <P>(ii) Trust lands;</P>
              <P>(iii) Department of the Interior Near-Reservation Service Areas;</P>

              <P>(ix) Alaska formula areas described in paragraph (4) of this definition.</P>

              <P>(2)(i) For a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, and for expansion or re-definition of a geographic area from the prior <PRTPAGE P="700"/>year, including those identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, the Indian tribe must submit, on a form agreed to by HUD, information about the geographic area it wishes to include in its Formula Area, including proof that the Indian tribe, where applicable, has agreed to provide housing services pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the tribal and public governing entity or entities of the area, or has attempted to establish such an MOA, and is providing substantial housing services and will continue to expend or obligate funds for substantial housing services, as reflected in its Indian Housing Plan and Annual Performance Report for this purpose.</P>

              <P>(ii) Upon receiving a request for recognition of a geographic area not identified in paragraph (1) of this definition, HUD shall make a preliminary determination. HUD shall notify all potentially affected Indian tribes of the basis for its preliminary determination by certified mail and provide the Indian tribes with the opportunity to comment for a period of not less than 90 days. After consideration of the comments, HUD shall announce its final determination through <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice.</P>
              <P>(iii) No Indian tribe may expand or redefine its Formula Area without complying with the requirements of paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) of this definition, notwithstanding any changes recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau.</P>
              <P>(iv) The geographic area into which an Indian tribe may expand under this paragraph (2) shall be the smallest U.S. Census unit or units encompassing the physical location where substantial housing services have been provided by the Indian tribe.</P>
              <P>(3) Subject to a challenge by an Indian tribe with a Formula Area described under paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition, any federally recognized Indian tribe assigned Formula Area geography in Fiscal Year 2003 not identified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition, shall continue to be assigned such Formula Area in subsequent fiscal years, provided that the Indian tribe continues to provide an appropriate level of housing services within the Formula Area as monitored by HUD using the definition of substantial housing services contained in this section as a guideline but not as a requirement.</P>

              <P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this definition, Alaska needs data shall be credited as set forth in § 1000.327 to the Alaska Native Village (ANV), the regional Indian tribe, or to the regional corporation established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (33 U.S.C. 1601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) (ANCSA). For purposes of § 1000.327 and this definition:</P>
              <P>(i) The formula area of the ANV shall be the geographic area of the village or that area delineated by the TDSA established for the ANV for purposes of the 1990 U.S. Census or the Alaska Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA) established for the ANV. To the extent that the area encompassed by such designation may substantially exceed the actual geographic area of the village, such designation is subject to challenge pursuant to § 1000.336. If the ANVSA or the TDSA is determined pursuant to such challenge to substantially exceed the actual area of the village, then the geographic formula area of the ANV for purposes of § 1000.327 shall be such U.S. Census designation as most closely approximates the actual geographic area of the village.</P>
              <P>(ii) The geographic formula area of the regional corporation shall be the area established for the corporation by the ANCSA.</P>
              <P>(iii) An Indian tribe may seek to expand its Alaska formula area within its ANCSA region pursuant to the procedures set out in paragraph (2) of this definition. Formula Area added in this way shall be treated as overlapping pursuant to § 1000.326, unless the Indian tribe's members in the expanded area are less than 50 percent of the AIAN population. In cases where the Indian tribe is not treated as overlapping, the Indian tribe shall be credited with population and housing data only for its own tribal member residents within the new or added area. All other population and housing data for the area shall remain with the Indian tribe or tribes previously credited with such data.</P>

              <P>(5) In some cases the population data for an Indian tribe within its Formula <PRTPAGE P="701"/>Area is greater than its tribal enrollment. In general, to maintain fairness for all Indian tribes, the tribe's population data will not be allowed to exceed twice an Indian tribe's enrolled population. However, an Indian tribe subject to this cap may receive an allocation based on more than twice its total enrollment if it can show that it is providing housing assistance to substantially more non-member Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of another federally recognized Indian tribe than it is to members. For state-recognized Indian tribes, the population data and formula allocation shall be limited to their tribal enrollment figures as determined under enrollment criteria in effect in 1996.</P>
              <P>(6) In cases where an Indian tribe is seeking to receive an allocation more than twice its total enrollment, the tribal enrollment multiplier will be determined by the total number of Indians and Alaska Natives to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance (on July 30 of the year before funding is sought) divided by the number of members to whom the Indian tribe is providing housing assistance. For example, an Indian tribe that provides housing to 300 Indians and Alaska Natives, of which 100 are members, the Indian tribe would then be able to receive an allocation for up to three times its tribal enrollment if the Indian and Alaska Native population in the area is three or more times the tribal enrollment.</P>

              <P>The Formula Current Assisted Stock component consists of two elements. They are:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Operating subsidy.</E> The operating subsidy consists of three variables which are:</P>
              <P>(1) The number of low-rent FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy;</P>
              <P>(2) The number of Section 8 units whose contract has expired but had been under contract on September 30, 1997, multiplied by the FY 1996 national per unit subsidy; and</P>
              <P>(3) The number of Mutual Help and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per unit subsidy.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Modernization allocation.</E> (1) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated 250 or more public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III FCAS units multiplied by the national per-unit amount of allocation for FY 1996 modernization multiplied by an adjustment factor for inflation.</P>
              <P>(2) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority that owned or operated fewer than 250 public housing units on October 1, 1997, the modernization allocation equals the average amount of funds received under the assistance program authorized by section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including funds provided as emergency assistance) for FYs 1992 through 1997.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Conversion.</E> Conversion of FCAS units from homeownership (Mutual Help or Turnkey III) to low-rent or from low-rent to a home ownership program.</P>
              <P>(1) If units were converted before October 1, 1997, as evidenced by an amended ACC, then those units will be counted for formula funding and eligibility purposes as the type of unit to which they were converted.</P>
              <P>(2) If units were converted on or after October 1, 1997, the following applies:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Funding type.</E> Units that converted after October 1, 1997 will be funded as the type of unit specified on the original ACC in effect on September 30, 1997.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Continued FCAS eligibility.</E> Whether or not it is the first conversion, a unit converted after October 1, 1997, will be considered as the type converted to when determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to low-rent will be treated as a low-rent unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility. A unit that is converted to homeownership will be treated as a homeownership unit for purposes of determining continuing FCAS eligibility.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) A Mutual Help or Turnkey III unit not conveyed after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance by the terms of the MHOA may continue to be considered Formula Current Assisted Stock only if a legal impediment prevented conveyance; the legal impediment continues to exist; the tribe, TDHE, or IHA has taken all other steps necessary for conveyance and all that remains for conveyance is a resolution of the legal impediment; and the tribe, TDHE, or IHA made the following reasonable efforts to overcome the impediments:</P>
              <P>(i) No later than four months after the unit becomes eligible for conveyance, the tribe, TDHE, or IHA creates a written plan of action, which includes a description of specific legal impediments as well as specific, ongoing, and appropriate actions for each applicable unit that have been taken and will be taken to resolve the legal impediments within a 24-month period; and</P>

FCAS units that have not been conveyed due to legal impediments on December 22, 2016 shall be treated as having become eligible for conveyance on December 22, 2016.</P>
              <P>(c) Rental units shall continue to be included for formula purposes as long as they continue to be operated as low income rental units by the Indian tribe, TDHE, or IHA.</P>
              <P>(d) Expired contract Section 8 units shall continue as rental units and be included in the formula as long as they are operated as low income rental units as included in the Indian tribe's or TDHE's Formula Response Form.</P>
              <P>(e) A unit that is demolished pursuant to a planned demolition may be considered eligible as a FCAS unit if, after demolition is completed, the unit is rebuilt within one year. Demolition is completed when the site of the demolished unit is ready for rebuilding. If the unit cannot be rebuilt within one year because of relative administrative capacities and other challenges faced by the recipient, including, but not limited to geographic distribution within the Indian area and technical capacity, the Indian tribe, TDHE or IHA may request approval for a one-time, one-year extension.

              <P>(c) The challenge and the collection of data and the appeal of HUD formula determinations is an allowable cost for IHBG funds.</P>
              <P>(d) An Indian tribe or TDHE that seeks to appeal data or a HUD formula determination, and has data in its possession that are acceptable to HUD, shall submit the challenge or appeal in writing with data and proper documentation to HUD. An Indian tribe or TDHE may appeal the undisbursed funds factor no later than 30 days after the receipt of the formula determination. Data used to challenge data contained in the U.S. Census must meet the requirements described in § 1000.330(a). Further, in order for a census challenge to be considered for the upcoming fiscal year allocation, documentation must be submitted by March 30th.</P>

              <P>(1) If HUD challenges the validity of the submitted data HUD and the Indian tribe or TDHE shall attempt in good faith to resolve any discrepancies so that such data may be included in the formula allocation.</P>
              <P>(2) If HUD denies a challenge or appeal, the Indian tribe or TDHE may request reconsideration of HUD's denial within 30 calendar days of receipt of HUD's denial. The request shall be in writing and set forth justification for reconsideration.</P>
              <P>(3) HUD shall in writing affirm or deny the Indian tribe's or TDHE's request for reconsideration, setting forth HUD's reasons for the decision, within 20 calendar days of receiving the request. HUD's denial of a request for reconsideration shall constitute final agency action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Are undisbursed IHBG funds a factor in the grant formula?</SUBJECT>
              <P>Yes, beginning fiscal year 2018. After calculating the initial allocation calculation for the current fiscal year by calculating FCAS, need, the 1996 Minimum, and repayments or additions for past over- or under-funding for each Indian tribe, the undisbursed funds factor shall be applied as follows:</P>

              <P>(a) The undisbursed funds factor applies if an Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more and the Indian tribe has undisbursed IHBG funds in an amount that is greater than the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations.<PRTPAGE P="709"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If subject to paragraph (a) of this section, the Indian tribe's grant allocation shall be the greater of the initial allocation calculation minus the amount of undisbursed IHBG funds that exceed the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations, or its 1996 Minimum.</P>
              <P>(c) For purposes of this section, “undisbursed IHBG funds” means the amount of IHBG funds allocated to an Indian tribe in HUD's line of credit control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made. For Indian tribes under an umbrella TDHE (a recipient that has been designated to receive grant amounts by more than one Indian tribe), if the Indian tribe's initial allocation calculation is $5 million or more, its undisbursed IHBG funds is the amount calculated by multiplying the umbrella TDHE's total balance in HUD's line of credit control system on October 1 of the fiscal year for which the allocation is made by a percentage based on the Indian tribe's proportional share of the initial allocation calculation of all tribes under the umbrella.</P>
              <P>(d) Amounts subtracted from an initial allocation calculation under this section shall be redistributed under the need component among all Indian tribes not subject to paragraph (a) of this section (while also retaining the 1996 Minimum).</P>

              <P>(b) These allocated amounts shall remain exclusively available for loan guarantee assistance for Indian tribes or TDHEs in the area of operation of that office until committed by HUD for loan guarantees or until the end of the second quarter of the fiscal year. At the beginning of the third quarter of the fiscal year, any residual loan guarantee commitment amount shall be made available to guarantee loans for Indian tribes or TDHEs regardless of their location. Applications for residual loan guarantee money must be submitted on or after April 1.</P>
              <P>(c) In approving applications for loan guarantee assistance, HUD shall seek to maximize the availability of such assistance to all interested Indian tribes or TDHEs.

              <P>(a) The recipient is responsible for monitoring grant activities, ensuring compliance with applicable Federal requirements and monitoring performance goals under the IHP. The recipient is responsible for preparing at least annually: a compliance assessment in accordance with section 403(b) of NAHASDA; a performance report covering the assessment of program progress and goal attainment under the IHP; and an audit in accordance with the Single Audit Act, as applicable. The recipient's monitoring should also include an evaluation of the recipient's performance in accordance with performance objectives and measures. At the request of a recipient, other Indian tribes and/or TDHEs may provide assistance to aid the recipient in meeting its performance goals or compliance requirements under NAHASDA.</P>
              <P>(b) Where the recipient is a TDHE, the grant beneficiary (Indian tribe) is responsible for monitoring programmatic and compliance requirements of the IHP and NAHASDA by requiring the TDHE to prepare periodic progress reports including the annual compliance assessment, performance and audit reports.</P>
              <P>(c) HUD is responsible for reviewing the recipient as set forth in § 1000.520.</P>
              <P>(d) HUD monitoring will consist of on-site as well as off-site review of records, reports and audits. To the extent funding is available, HUD or its designee will provide technical assistance and training, or funds to the recipient to obtain technical assistance and training. In the absence of funds, HUD shall make best efforts to provide technical assistance and training.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1000.503</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>What is an appropriate extent of HUD monitoring?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Subject to any conflicting or supplementary requirement of specific legislation, and upon the effective date of this regulation, the frequency of HUD monitoring of a particular recipient will be determined by application of the HUD standard risk assessment factors, provided that when a recipient requests to be monitored, HUD shall conduct such monitoring as soon as practicable. The HUD standard risk assessment factors may be but are not limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Annual grant amount;</P>
              <P>(2) Disbursed amounts—all open grants;</P>
              <P>(3) Months since last on-site monitoring;</P>
              <P>(4) Delinquent audits under 2 CFR part 200, subpart F;</P>
              <P>(5) Open 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, or Inspector General audit findings;</P>
              <P>(6) Conclusions of 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, auditor;</P>
              <P>(7) Open monitoring findings;</P>
              <P>(8) Delinquent Annual Performance Reports or Annual Status and Evaluation Reports;</P>
              <P>(9) Status of Corrective Action Plan (CAP) or Performance Agreement (PA);</P>
              <P>(10) Recipient Self-Monitoring;</P>
              <P>(11) Inspection of 1937 Act units;</P>
              <P>(12) Preservation of 1937 Act units; and</P>
              <P>(13) Any other additional factors that may be determined by HUD, consistent with HUD's Tribal Consultation Policy, by which HUD will send written notification and provide a comment period. Such additional factors shall be provided by program guidance.</P>
              <P>(b) If monitoring indicates noncompliance, HUD may undertake additional sampling and review to determine the extent of such noncompliance. The level of HUD monitoring of a recipient once that recipient has been selected for HUD monitoring is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Review recipient program compliance for the current program year and the 2 prior program years;</P>

              <P>(2) On-site inspection of no more than 10 dwelling units or no more than 10 percent of total dwelling units, whichever is greater;<PRTPAGE P="714"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Review of no more than 10 client files or no more than 10 percent of client files, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, HUD may at any time undertake additional sampling and review of prior program years, subject to the records retention limitations of § 1000.552, if HUD has credible information suggesting noncompliance. HUD will share this information with the recipient as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(d) A recipient may request ONAP to enter into Self-Monitoring Mutual Agreements or other self-monitoring arrangements with recipients. ONAP will monitor the recipient only in accordance with such agreement or arrangement, unless ONAP finds reasonable evidence of fraud, a pattern of noncompliance, or the significant unlawful expenditure of IHBG funds.</P>

              <P>(b) Before undertaking any action in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will notify the recipient in writing of the action it intends to take and provide the recipient an opportunity for an informal meeting to resolve the deficiency. Before taking any action under paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall provide the recipient with the opportunity for a hearing no less than 30 days prior to taking the proposed action. The hearing shall be held in accordance with § 1000.540. The amount in question shall not be reallocated under the provisions of § 1000.536, until 15 days after the hearing has been conducted and HUD has rendered a final decision.</P>
              <P>(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if HUD makes a determination that the failure of a recipient to comply substantially with any material provision of NAHASDA or these regulations is resulting, and would continue to result, in a continuing expenditure of funds provided under NAHASDA in a manner that is not authorized by law, HUD may, in accordance with section 401(a)(4) of NAHASDA, take action under paragraph (a)(3) of this section prior to conducting a hearing under paragraph (b) of this section. HUD shall provide notice to the recipient at the time that HUD takes that action and conducts a hearing, in accordance with section 401(a)(4)(B) of NAHASDA, within 60 days of such notice.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if HUD determines that the failure to comply substantially with the provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations is not a pattern or practice of activities constituting willful noncompliance, and is a result of the limited capability or capacity of the recipient, if the recipient requests, HUD shall provide technical assistance for the recipient (directly or indirectly) that is designed to increase the capability or capacity of the recipient to administer assistance under NAHASDA in compliance with the requirements under NAHASDA. A recipient's eligibility for technical assistance under this subsection is contingent on the recipient's execution of, and compliance with, a performance agreement pursuant to Section 401(b) of NAHASDA.</P>
              <P>(e) In lieu of, or in addition to, any action described in this section, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient has failed to comply substantially with any provisions of NAHASDA or these regulations, HUD may refer the matter to the Attorney General of the United States, with a recommendation that appropriate civil action be instituted.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 1000—Indian Housing Block Grant Formula Mechanics</HD>
              <P>This appendix shows the different components of the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) formula. The following text explains how each component of the IHBG formula is calculated.</P>
              <P>1. The first step in running the IHBG formula is to determine the amount available for allocation in the Fiscal Year (FY). It is the sum of:</P>
              <P>(a) The FY appropriation for the IHBG program less amounts in the Appropriations Act mandated for purposes other than the formula allocation.</P>
              <P>(b) The net amount, if any, made available as a result of corrections for over- or under-allocations in prior FYs.</P>
              <P>(c) The amount, if any, made available pursuant to § 1000.536.</P>
              <P>(d) The amounts, if any, made available because tribes voluntarily returned, or did not accept, the amounts allocated to them in prior FYs, defined as “carryover” (see § 1000.329).</P>
              <P>2. If there is carryover as defined in § 1000.329, the amount of carryover up to $3 million, is then held aside for allocation under the minimum total grant provisions of the formula (see 11 below).</P>
              <P>3. The IHBG formula first calculates the amount each tribe is allocated under the Formula Current Assisted Stock (FCAS) component (See §§ 1000.310 through 1000.322). The FCAS component is comprised of two parts, Operating Subsidy (§ 1000.316(a)) and Modernization (§ 1000.316(b)).</P>
              <P>(a) The Operating Subsidy component is calculated in two steps, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Each tribe's counts of Low Rent, Homeownership (Mutual Help and Turnkey III), and Section 8 units are multiplied by the National Per Unit Subsidy for operations for that category of unit, which is a 1996 index for the type of unit that is adjusted for inflation (see § 1000.302 defining National Per Unit Subsidy). The amounts are summed to create an initial calculation of the operating subsidy component.</P>
              <P>(ii) The initial operating subsidy component amount is then adjusted for local area costs, using an adjustment factor called the AELFMR. The AELFMR factor is calculated for each tribe in three steps. First, an Allowable Expense Level (AEL) factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's AEL, a historic per-unit measure of operating cost, by the national weighted average AEL (see § 1000.302 defining Allowable Expense Level). Second, a Fair Market Rent (FMR) factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's FMR amount, an area-specific index published annually by HUD (see § 1000.302 Fair Market Rent factor), by the national weighted average FMR. Third, an AELFMR factor is created by assigning each tribe the greater of its AEL or FMR factor, and dividing that figure by the national weighted average AELFMR. In all cases, when the national average figure is calculated, tribes are weighted by the amount of their initial operating subsidy as calculated in 3(a)(i).</P>
              <P>(See § 1000.320).</P>
              <P>(b) The Modernization component is determined using two methods depending on the number of public housing units that a tribe's housing authority operated prior to the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act.</P>

              <P>(i) For all tribes, the number of Low Rent, Mutual Help, and Turnkey III units are multiplied by the National Per Unit Subsidy for modernization from 1996 adjusted for inflation (see § 1000.302 defining National Per Unit Subsidy).<PRTPAGE P="720"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) For Indian tribes with an Indian Housing Authority (IHA) that owned or operated fewer than 250 units on October 1, 1997, an alternative modernization component is calculated from the amount of funds the IHA received under the assistance program authorized by Section 14 of the 1937 Act (not including funds provided as emergency assistance) for FYs 1992 through 1997 (see § 1000.316(b)(2)). If this alternative calculation is greater than the amount calculated in paragraph (a) above, it is used to calculate the tribe's modernization component.</P>
              <P>(iii) The Modernization component is then multiplied by a local area cost adjustment factor based on the Total Development Cost (TDC) for the tribe (see § 1000.302) divided by the national weighted average of all TDCs weighted by each tribe's pre-adjustment Modernization calculation in paragraph (b)(i) or (ii) above as applicable.</P>
              <P>4. The total amounts calculated under the FCAS component for each tribe are then added together to determine the national total amount allocated under the FCAS component. That total is subtracted from the funds available for allocation less the carryover amount held aside for allocation under the minimum total grant provision in § 1000.329. The remainder is the total amount available for allocation under the need component of the IHBG formula.</P>
              <P>5. The first step in calculating need component is identifying weighted needs variables and adjusting for local area cost differences.</P>
              <P>(a) Need is first calculated using seven factors, where each factor is a tribe's share of the national totals for each of seven variables. The data used for the seven variables is described in § 1000.330. The person count variable is adjusted for statistically significant undercounts for reservations, trust lands and remote Alaska and for growth in population since the latest Decennial Census. The Population Cap provision in § 1000.302 Formula Area (5) is then applied. Needs data are capped if the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population counts exceed twice tribal enrollment unless a tribe can demonstrate that it serves more than twice as many non-tribal members as tribal members, in which case the cap is adjusted upward.</P>
              <P>The factors are weighted as set forth in § 1000.324, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) 22 percent of the amount available for allocation under the needs component are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households paying more than 50 percent of their income for housing and living in each tribe's Formula Area (see § 1000.302);</P>
              <P>(ii) 25 percent are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households living in overcrowded housing and/or without kitchen or plumbing in each tribe's Formula Area;</P>
              <P>(iii) 15 percent are allocated by the share of the total AIAN households with an annual income less than or equal to 80 percent of Formula Median Income (see § 1000.302) living in each tribe's Formula Area less the tribe's number of FCAS.</P>
              <P>(iv) 13 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income less than or equal to 30 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;</P>
              <P>(v) 7 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income between 30 percent and 50 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;</P>
              <P>(vi) 7 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN households with annual income between 50 percent and 80 percent of Formula Median Income living in each tribe's Formula Area;</P>
              <P>(vii) 11 percent are allocated by the share of AIAN persons living in each tribe's Formula Area.</P>
              <P>(b) The result of these calculations for each tribe is then multiplied by a local area cost adjustment based on the Total Development Cost for the tribe (see § 1000.302) divided by the national weighted average of TDCs weighted by each tribe's pre-adjustment need calculation. (See § 1000.325).</P>
              <P>6. Each tribe's initial need allocation amount is then adjusted under the minimum need allocation provision of § 1000.328. Tribes that are allocated less than $200,000 under the FCAS component of the IHBG formula and that certify the presence of any households at or below 80 percent of median income in their Indian Housing Plans will be allocated no less than a specified minimum under the needs component of the formula. The specified minimum amount shall equal 0.007826 percent of the appropriation for that FY after set-asides. The increase in funding for the tribes allocated the minimum need amount is funded by a reallocation from other tribes whose needs allocation exceeds the minimum need amount. This is necessary in order to keep the total allocation within the appropriation level (See § 1000.328).</P>

              <P>7. Whenever a new Data Source is first introduced, provision is made to moderate extreme impacts through phase down adjustments. For purposes of these adjustments, new data sources (see § 1000.331) include the initial introduction of the American Community Survey and 2010 Decennial Census in 2018, and the initial introduction of the 2020 Decennial Census when it becomes available. Tribes whose allocation under the need component decrease by more than ten percent in the first year of introduction will have that decrease moderated by subsequent adjustments, as required to prevent a drop of more than ten percent per year in the tribes' needs allocation attributable solely to the introduction of the New Data Source. After allocation adjustments are made under § 1000.331 <PRTPAGE P="721"/>for a FY, the needs allocation of an Indian tribe whose needs allocation increased as a result of the introduction of a New Data Source under § 1000.331 shall be adjusted downward proportionate to its share of the total increase in funding resulting from the introduction of a New Data Source to keep the overall needs allocation within available appropriations.</P>
              <P>8. A tribe's preliminary total allocation for a grant is calculated by summing the amounts calculated under the FCAS and need components. This amount is compared to how much a tribe received in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization under the 1937 Housing Act. If a tribe received more in FY 1996 for operating subsidy and modernization than it does under the IHBG formula allocation, its preliminary total allocation is adjusted up to the FY 1996 amount (See § 1000.340(b)). Indian tribes receiving more under the IHBG formula than in FY 1996 have their grant allocations adjusted downward to offset the upward adjustments for the other tribes.</P>
              <P>9. The initial allocation amount for the current FY is calculated by adding any adjustments for over- or under-funding occurring in prior FYs to the allocation calculated in the previous step. These adjustments typically result from late reporting of FCAS changes, or conveyances which occur in a timely manner following the removal of units from eligibility due to conveyance eligibility.</P>
              <P>10. The Undisbursed Funds Factor component is calculated based on the initial allocation amounts calculated above. Tribes with an initial allocation of $5 million or more and undisbursed IHBG grant amounts (the amount available to the tribe in HUD's line of credit control on October 1 of the FY for which the allocation is being made) in an amount greater than the sum of the prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations will have their initial allocation amount adjusted down by the difference between the tribe's undisbursed grant amounts and the sum of its prior 3 years' initial allocation calculations. If this adjustment would bring the tribe below its FY 1996 minimum (see § 1000.340(b)), then the tribe will be allocated its FY 1996 minimum. The sum of the adjustments will be reallocated among the other tribes proportionally under the need component.</P>
              <P>11. A final adjustment is made under § 1000.329 which allocates available carryover amounts up to $3 million to achieve minimum total allocations. Tribes that certify in their Indian Housing Plans the presence of any eligible households at or below 80 percent of median income and whose current FY formula allocation after the Undisbursed Funds Factor adjustment determined in the preceding step is less than 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, will have their allocation adjusted upwards to 0.011547 percent of the FY appropriation after set-asides, or to a lesser percentage which can be achieved for all eligible tribes with available carryover held for this adjustment (see 2 above).</P>

              <P>a. OPSUB is calculated in two steps, as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) First, the number of Low-Rent, Section 8 and homeownership units are multiplied by the applicable national per unit subsidy (§ 1000.302 National Per Unit Subsidy). The amounts are summed to create an initial calculation of the Operating Subsidy component.

              <P>(ii) The initial Operating Subsidy component amount is then adjusted for local area costs, using an adjustment factor called the AELFMR. The AELFMR factor is calculated for each tribe in three steps. First, an AEL factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's Allowable Expense Level (AEL), a historic per-unit measure of operating cost, by the national weighted average AEL (see § 1000.302 defining Allowable Expense Level)

              <P>Second, an FMR factor is calculated by dividing the tribe's Fair Market Rent amount (FMR), an area-specific index published annually by HUD (see § 1000.302 Fair Market Rent factor), by the national weighted average FMR.
              </P>

              <P>Third, an AELFMR factor is created by assigning each tribe the greater of its AEL or FMR factor, and dividing that figure by the national weighted average AELFMR. In all cases, when the national average figure is calculated, tribes are weighted by the amount of their initial operating subsidy as calculated in 3(a)(i) above. (See § 1000.320).

The person count variable is adjusted for statistically significant undercounts for reservations, trust lands and remote Alaska and for changes in population since the latest Decennial Census.

              <P>The primary objective of the Indian CDBG (ICDBG) Program and of the community development program of each grantee covered under the Act is the development of viable Indian and Alaska native communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The Federal assistance provided in this part is not to be used to reduce substantially the amount of tribal financial support for community development activities below the level of such support before the availability of this assistance.</P>

              <P>The selection of single purpose grantees under subpart B of this part is competitive in nature. Therefore, selection of grantees for funds will reflect consideration of the relative adequacy of applications in addressing tribally determined need. The selection of grantees of imminent threat grants under the provisions of subpart B of this part is not competitive in nature. However, applicants for funding under either subpart must have the administrative capacity to undertake the community development activities proposed, including the systems of internal control necessary to administer these activities effectively without fraud, waste, or mismanagement.</P>

              <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, funds will be allocated to the Area ONAPs responsible for the program on the following basis:</P>
              <P>(1) Each Area ONAP will be allocated $1,000,000 as a base amount, to which will be added a formula share of the balance of the ICDBG Program funds, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The amount remaining after the base amount is allocated and any amount retained by the Headquarters ONAP to fund imminent threat grants pursuant to the provisions of § 1003.402 is subtracted, will be allocated to each Area ONAP based on the most recent data complied and published by the United States Bureau of the Census referable to the same point or period in time, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total eligible Indian population;</P>
              <P>(ii) Forty percent (40%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of poverty among the eligible Indian population; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Twenty percent (20%) of the funds will be allocated based upon each Area ONAP's share of the total extent of overcrowded housing among the eligible Indian population.</P>

              <P>(b) HUD will use other criteria to determine an allocation formula for distributing funds to the Area ONAPs if funds are set aside by statute for a specific purpose in any fiscal year if it is determined that the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is inappropriate to accomplish the purpose. HUD will use other criteria if it is determined that, based on a limited appropriation of funds, the use of the formula in paragraph (a) of this section is <PRTPAGE P="731"/>inappropriate to obtain an equitable allocation of funds.</P>
              <P>(c) Data used for the allocation of funds will be based upon the Indian population of those tribes and villages that are determined to be eligible ninety (90) days before the beginning of each fiscal year.</P>

              <P>ICDBG funds may be used for the following activities:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acquisition.</E> Acquisition in whole or in part by the grantee, or other public or private nonprofit entity, by purchase, long-term lease, donation, or otherwise, of real property (including air rights, water rights, rights-of-way, easements, and other interests therein) for any public purpose, subject to the limitations of § 1003.207.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disposition.</E> Disposition, through sale, lease, donation, or otherwise, of any real property acquired with ICDBG funds or its retention for public purposes, including reasonable costs of temporarily managing such property or property acquired under urban renewal, provided that the proceeds from any such disposition shall be program income subject to the requirements set forth in § 1003.503.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Public facilities and improvements.</E> Acquisition, construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or installation of public facilities and improvements, except as provided in § 1003.207(a), carried out by the grantee or other public or private nonprofit entities. In undertaking such activities, design features and improvements which promote energy efficiency may be included. [However, activities under this paragraph may be directed to the removal of material and architectural barriers that restrict the mobility and accessibility of elderly or severely disabled persons to publicly owned and privately owned buildings, facilities, and improvements including those provided for in § 1003.207(a)(1).] Such activities may also include the execution of architectural design features, and similar treatments intended to enhance the aesthetic quality of facilities and improvements receiving ICDBG assistance. Facilities designed for use in providing shelter for persons having special needs are considered public facilities and not subject to the prohibition of new housing construction described in § 1003.207(b)(3). Such facilities include shelters for the homeless; convalescent homes; hospitals, nursing homes; battered spouse shelters; halfway houses for run-away children, drug offenders or parolees; group homes for mentally retarded persons and temporary housing for disaster victims. In certain cases, nonprofit entities and subrecipients including those specified in § 1003.204 may acquire title to public facilities. When such facilities are owned by nonprofit entities or subrecipients, they shall be operated so as to be open for use by the general public <PRTPAGE P="732"/>during all normal hours of operation. Public facilities and improvements eligible for assistance under this paragraph (c) are subject to the following policies in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Special policies governing facilities.</E> The following special policies apply to:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Facilities containing both eligible and ineligible uses.</E> A public facility otherwise eligible for assistance under the ICDBG program may be provided with ICDBG funds even if it is part of a multiple use building containing ineligible uses, if:</P>
              <P>(A) The facility which is otherwise eligible and proposed for assistance will occupy a designated and discrete area within the larger facility; and</P>
              <P>(B) The grantee can determine the costs attributable to the facility proposed for assistance as separate and distinct from the overall costs of the multiple-use building and/or facility. Allowable costs are limited to those attributable to the eligible portion of the building or facility.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Equipment purchase.</E> As stated in § 1003.207(b)(1), the purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible. However, the purchase of construction equipment for use as part of a solid waste facility is eligible. In addition, the purchase of fire protection equipment is considered to be an integral part of a public facility, and, therefore, the purchase of such equipment is also eligible.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Fees for use of facilities.</E> Reasonable fees may be charged for the use of the facilities assisted with ICDBG funds, but charges such as excessive membership fees, which will have the effect of precluding low and moderate income persons from using the facilities, are not permitted.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Special assessments under the ICDBG program.</E> The following policies relate to special assessments under the ICDBG program:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Definition of special assessment.</E> The term <E T="03">special assessment</E> means the recovery of the capital costs of a public improvement, such as streets, water or sewer lines, curbs, and gutters, through a fee or charge levied or filed as a lien against a parcel of real estate as a direct result of benefit derived from the installation of a public improvement, or a one-time charge made as a condition of access to a public improvement. This term does not relate to taxes, or the establishment of the value of real estate for the purpose of levying real estate, property, or ad valorem taxes, and does not include periodic charges based on the use of a public improvement, such as water or sewer user charges, even if such charges include the recovery of all or some portion of the capital costs of the public improvement.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Special assessments to recover capital costs.</E> Where ICDBG funds are used to pay all or part of the cost of a public improvement, special assessments may be imposed as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) Special assessments to recover the ICDBG funds may be made only against properties owned and occupied by persons not of low and moderate income. Such assessments constitute program income.</P>
              <P>(B) Special assessments to recover the non-ICDBG portion may be made provided that ICDBG funds are used to pay the special assessment on behalf of all properties owned and occupied by low and moderate income persons; except that ICDBG funds need not be used to pay the special assessments on behalf of properties owned and occupied by moderate income persons if the grantee certifies that it does not have sufficient ICDBG funds to pay the assessments in behalf of all of the low and moderate income owner-occupant persons. Funds collected through such special assessments are not program income.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1003.207</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Ineligible activities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The general rule is that any activity that is not authorized under the provisions of §§ 1003.201 through 1003.206 is ineligible to be assisted with ICDBG funds. This section identifies specific activities that are ineligible and provides guidance in determining the eligibility of other activities frequently associated with housing and community development.</P>
              <P>(a) The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds:</P>
              <P>(1) Buildings or portions thereof used for the general conduct of government as defined at § 1003.4 cannot be assisted with ICDBG funds. This does not include, however, the removal of architectural barriers under § 1003.201(c) involving any such building. Also, where acquisition of real property includes an existing improvement which is to be used in the provision of a building for the general conduct of government, the portion of the acquisition cost attributable to the land is eligible, provided such acquisition meets the primary objective described in § 1003.208.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">General government expenses.</E> Except as otherwise specifically authorized in this subpart or under 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, expenses required to carry out the regular responsibilities of the grantee are not eligible for assistance under this part.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Political activities.</E> ICDBG funds shall not be used to finance the use of facilities or equipment for political purposes or to engage in other partisan political activities, such as candidate forums, voter transportation, or voter registration. However, a facility originally assisted with ICDBG funds may be used on an incidental basis to hold political meetings, candidate forums, or voter registration campaigns, provided that all parties and organizations have access to the facility on an equal <PRTPAGE P="740"/>basis, and are assessed equal rent or use charges, if any.</P>
              <P>(b) The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds unless authorized under provisions of § 1003.203 or as otherwise specifically noted herein, or when carried out by a CBDO under the provisions of § 1003.204.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Purchase of equipment.</E> The purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Construction equipment.</E> The purchase of construction equipment is ineligible, but compensation for the use of such equipment through leasing or depreciation pursuant to 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, for an otherwise eligible activity is an eligible use of ICDBG funds.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Furnishings and personal property.</E> The purchase of equipment, fixtures, motor vehicles, furnishings, or other personal property not an integral structural fixture is generally ineligible. Exceptions to this general prohibition are set forth in § 1003.201(o).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operating and maintenance expenses.</E> The general rule is that any expense associated with repairing, operating or maintaining public facilities, improvements and services is ineligible. Specific exceptions to this general rule are operating and maintenance expenses associated with public service activities, interim assistance, and office space for program staff employed in carrying out the ICDBG program. For example, the use of ICDBG funds to pay the allocable costs of operating and maintaining a facility used in providing a public service would be eligible under § 1003.201(e), even if no other costs of providing such a service are assisted with such funds. Examples of ineligible operating and maintenance expenses are:</P>
              <P>(i) Maintenance and repair of streets, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for persons with a disability, parking and similar public facilities; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Payment of salaries for staff, utility costs and similar expenses necessary for the operation of public works and facilities.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">New housing construction.</E> ICDBG funds may not be used for the construction of new permanent residential structures or for any program to subsidize or assist such new construction, except:</P>
              <P>(i) As provided under the last resort housing provisions set forth in 24 CFR part 42; or</P>
              <P>(ii) When carried out by a CBDO pursuant to § 1003.204(a);</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Income payments.</E> The general rule is that ICDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the ICDBG program, income payments means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing, housing (rent or mortgage) or utilities, but excludes emergency payments made over a period of up to three months to the provider of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 1003.208</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Criteria for compliance with the primary objective.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Act establishes as its primary objective the development of viable communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. Consistent with this objective, not less than 70 percent of the expenditures of each single purpose grant shall be for activities which meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Activities meeting these criteria as applicable will be considered to benefit low and moderate income persons unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. In assessing any such evidence, the full range of direct effects of the assisted activity will be considered. (The grantee shall appropriately ensure that activities that meet these criteria do not benefit moderate income persons to the exclusion of low income persons.)</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Area benefit activities.</E> (1) An activity, the benefits of which are available to all the residents in a particular area, where at least 51 percent of the residents are low and moderate income persons. Such an area need not be coterminous with census tracts or other officially recognized boundaries but must be the entire area served by the <PRTPAGE P="741"/>activity. An activity that serves an area that is not primarily residential in character shall not qualify under this criterion.</P>
              <P>(2) For purposes of determining qualification under this criterion, activities of the same type that serve different areas will be considered separately on the basis of their individual service area.</P>
              <P>(3) In determining whether there is a sufficiently large percentage of low and moderate income persons residing in the area served by an activity to qualify under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the most recently available decennial census information shall be used to the fullest extent feasible, together with the Section 8 income limits that would have applied at the time the income information was collected by the Census Bureau. Grantees that believe that the census data does not reflect current relative income levels in an area, or where census boundaries do not coincide sufficiently well with the service area of an activity, may conduct (or have conducted) a current survey of the residents of the area to determine the percent of such persons that are low and moderate income. HUD will accept information obtained through such surveys, to be used in lieu of the decennial census data, where it determines that the survey was conducted in such a manner that the results meet standards of statistical reliability that are comparable to that of the decennial census data for areas of similar size. Where there is substantial evidence that provides a clear basis to believe that the use of the decennial census data would substantially overstate the proportion of persons residing there that are low and moderate income, HUD may require that the grantee rebut such evidence in order to demonstrate compliance with section 105(c)(2) of the Act.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Limited clientele activities.</E> (1) An activity which benefits a limited clientele, at least 51 percent of whom are low or moderate income persons. (The following kinds of activities may not qualify under paragraph (b) of this section: Activities, the benefits of which are available to all the residents of an area; activities involving the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of property for housing; or activities where the benefit to low and moderate income persons to be considered is the creation or retention of jobs except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.) To qualify under paragraph (b) of this section, the activity must meet one of the following tests:</P>
              <P>(i) Benefit a clientele who are generally presumed to be principally low and moderate income persons. Activities that exclusively serve a group of persons in any one of the following categories may be presumed to benefit persons, 51 percent of whom are low-and moderate-income: abused children, battered spouses, elderly persons, adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled”, homeless persons, illiterate adults, persons living with AIDS, and migrant workers; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Require information on family size and income so that it is evident that at least 51 percent of the clientele are persons whose family income does not exceed the low and moderate income limit; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Have income eligibility requirements which limit the activity exclusively to low and moderate income persons; or</P>
              <P>(iv) Be of such nature and be in such location that it may be concluded that the activity's clientele will primarily be low and moderate income persons.</P>
              <P>(2) An activity that serves to remove material or architectural barriers to the mobility or accessibility of elderly persons or adults meeting the Bureau of the Census' Current Population Reports definition of “severely disabled” will be presumed to qualify under this criterion if it is restricted, to the extent practicable, to the removal of such barriers by assisting:</P>
              <P>(i) The reconstruction of a public facility or improvement, or portion thereof, that does not qualify under § 1003.208(a); or</P>
              <P>(ii) The rehabilitation of a privately-owned nonresidential building or improvement that does not qualify under § 1003.208 (a) or (d); or</P>

              <P>(iii) The rehabilitation of the common areas of a residential structure that contains more than one dwelling unit.<PRTPAGE P="742"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) A microenterprise assistance activity carried out in accordance with the provisions of § 1003.201(l) with respect to those owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises assisted under the activity during the grant period who are low and moderate income persons. For purposes of this paragraph, persons determined to be low and moderate income may be presumed to continue to qualify for up to a three year period.</P>
              <P>(4) An activity designed to provide job training and placement and/or other employment support services, including but not limited to, peer support programs, counseling, child care, transportation, and other similar services, in which the percentage of low and moderate income persons assisted is less than 51 percent may qualify under this paragraph in the following limited circumstance:</P>
              <P>(i) In such cases where such training or provision of supportive services assists business(es), the only use of ICDBG assistance for the project is to provide the job training and/or supportive services; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The proportion of the total cost of the project borne by ICDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of the total number of persons assisted who are low or moderate income.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Housing activities.</E> An eligible activity carried out for the purpose of providing or improving permanent residential structures which, upon completion, will be occupied by low and moderate income households. This would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the acquisition or rehabilitation of property, conversion of non-residential structures, and new housing construction. Funds expended for activities which qualify under the provisions of this paragraph shall be counted as benefiting low and moderate income persons but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including ICDBG and non-ICDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing to be occupied by low and moderate income persons. If the structure assisted contains two dwelling units, at least one must be occupied by low and moderate income households, and if the structure contains more than two dwelling units, at least 51 percent of the units must be so occupied. Where two or more rental buildings being assisted are or will be located on the same or contiguous properties, and the buildings will be under common ownership and management, the grouped buildings may be considered for this purpose as a single structure. For rental housing, occupancy by low and moderate income households must be at affordable rents to qualify under this criterion. The grantee shall adopt and make public its standards for determining “affordable rents” for this purpose. The following shall also qualify under this criterion:</P>
              <P>(1) When less than 51 percent of the units in a structure will be occupied by low and moderate income households, ICDBG assistance may be provided in the following limited circumstances:</P>
              <P>(i) The assistance is for an eligible activity to reduce the development cost of the new construction of a multifamily, non-elderly rental housing project;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not less than 20 percent of the units will be occupied by low and moderate income households at affordable rents; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The proportion of the total cost of developing the project to be borne by ICDBG funds is no greater than the proportion of units in the project that will be occupied by low and moderate income households.</P>
              <P>(2) When ICDBG funds are used for housing services eligible under § 1003.201(j), such funds shall be considered to benefit low-and moderate-income persons if the housing for which the services are provided is to be occupied by low-and moderate-income households.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Job creation or retention activities.</E> An activity designed to create or retain permanent jobs where at least 51 percent of the jobs, computed on a full time equivalent basis, involve the employment of low and moderate persons. For purposes of determining whether a job is held by or made available to a low or moderate income person, the person may be presumed to be a low or moderate income person if: he/she resides within a census tract (or block numbering area) where not less than 70 percent of the residents have incomes <PRTPAGE P="743"/>at or below 80 percent of the area median; or, if he/she resides in a census tract (or block numbering area) which meets the Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community eligibility criteria; or, if the assisted business is located in and the job under consideration is to be located in such a tract or area. As a general rule, each assisted business shall be considered to be a separate activity for purposes of determining whether the activity qualifies under this paragraph. However, in certain cases such as where ICDBG funds are used to acquire, develop or improve a real property (e.g., a business incubator or an industrial park) the requirement may be met by measuring jobs in the aggregate for all the businesses which locate on the property, provided such businesses are not otherwise assisted by ICDBG funds. Where ICDBG funds are used to pay for the staff and overhead costs of a CBDO under the provisions of § 1003.204 making loans to businesses from non-ICDBG funds, this requirement may be met by aggregating the jobs created by all of the businesses receiving loans during any one year period. For an activity that creates jobs, the grantee must document that at least 51 percent of the jobs will be held by, or will be available to, low and moderate income persons. For an activity that retains jobs, the grantee must document that the jobs would actually be lost without the ICDBG assistance and that either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to at least 51 percent of the jobs at the time the ICDBG assistance is provided: The job is known to be held by a low or moderate income person; or the job can reasonably be expected to turn over within the following two years and that steps will be taken to ensure that it will be filled by, or made available to, a low or moderate income person upon turnover. Jobs will be considered to be available to low and moderate income persons for these purposes only if:</P>
              <P>(1) Special skills that can only be acquired with substantial training or work experience or education beyond high school are not a prerequisite to fill such jobs, or the business agrees to hire unqualified persons and provide training; and</P>
              <P>(2) The grantee and the assisted business take actions to ensure that low and moderate income persons receive first consideration for filling such jobs.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional criteria.</E> (1) Where the assisted activity is acquisition of real property, a preliminary determination of whether the activity addresses the primary objective may be based on the planned use of the property after acquisition. A final determination shall be based on the actual use of the property, excluding any short-term, temporary use.</P>
              <P>(2) Where the assisted activity is relocation assistance that the grantee is required to provide, such relocation assistance shall be considered to address the primary objective as addressed by the displacing activity.</P>
              <P>(3) In any case where the activity undertaken for the purpose of creating or retaining jobs is a public improvement and the area served is primarily residential, the activity must meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as well as those of paragraph (d) of this section in order to qualify as benefiting low and moderate income persons.</P>
              <P>(4) Expenditures for activities meeting the criteria for benefiting low and moderate income persons shall be used in determining the extent to which the grantee's overall program benefits such persons. In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activities:</P>
              <P>(i) Costs of administration and planning, eligible under § 1003.205 and § 1003.206 respectively, will be assumed to benefit low and moderate income persons in the same proportion as the remainder of the ICDBG funds and, accordingly, shall be excluded from the calculation.</P>
              <P>(ii) Funds expended for the acquisition, new construction or rehabilitation of property for housing those qualified under § 1003.208(c) shall be counted for this purpose, but shall be limited to an amount determined by multiplying the total cost (including ICDBG and non-ICDBG costs) of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation by the percent of units in such housing occupied by low and moderate income persons.</P>

              <P>(iii) Funds expended for any other activity which qualifies under § 1003.208 <PRTPAGE P="744"/>shall be counted for this purpose in their entirety.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Prohibition on use of assistance for employment relocation activities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Prohibition.</E> ICDBG funds may not be used to directly assist a business, including a business expansion, in the relocation of a plant, facility, or operation from one Identified Service Area to another Identified Service Area, if the relocation is likely to result in a significant loss of jobs in the Identified Service Area from which the relocation occurs.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply to this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Directly assist.</E> Directly assist means the provision of ICDBG funds for activities pursuant to:</P>
              <P>(i) § 1003.203(b); or</P>
              <P>(ii) §§ 1003.201(a)-(d), 1003.201(k), 1003.203(a), or § 1003.204 when the grantee, subrecipient, or, in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 1003.204, a Community Based Development Organization (CBDO) enters into an agreement with a business to undertake one or more of these activities as a condition of the business relocating a facility, plant, or operation to the grantee's Identified Service Area. Provision of public facilities and indirect assistance that will provide benefit to multiple businesses does not fall under the definition of “directly assist,” unless it includes the provision of infrastructure to aid a specific business that is the subject of an agreement with the specific assisted business.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Area.</E> The relevant definition of “area” for a Native American economic development project is the “Identified Service Area” for the eligible applicant, as defined in § 1003.4.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Operation.</E> A business operation includes, but is not limited to, any equipment, employment opportunity, production capacity, or product line of the business.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Significant loss of jobs.</E> (i) A loss of jobs is significant if the number of jobs to be lost in the Identified Service Area in which the affected business is currently located is equal to or greater than one-tenth of one percent of the total number of persons in the labor force of that area; or, in all cases, a loss of 500 or more jobs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, a loss of 25 jobs or fewer does not constitute a significant loss of jobs.</P>
              <P>(ii) A job is considered to be lost due to the provision of ICDBG assistance if the job is relocated within 3 years of the provision of assistance to the business; or the time period within which jobs are to be created, as specified by the agreement between the business and the recipient, is longer than 3 years.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Written agreement.</E> Before directly assisting a business with ICDBG funds, the recipient, subrecipient, or a CBDO (in the case of an activity carried out pursuant to § 1003.204) shall sign a written agreement with the assisted business. The written agreement shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Statement.</E> A statement from the assisted business as to whether the assisted activity will result in the relocation of any industrial or commercial plant, facility, or operation from one Identified Service Area to another, and, if so, the number of jobs that will be relocated from each Identified Service Area; and</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Required certification.</E> If the assistance will not result in a relocation covered by this section, a certification from the assisted business that neither it, nor any of its subsidiaries, has plans to relocate jobs, at the time the agreement is signed, that would result in a significant job loss as defined in this rule.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Assistance not covered by this section.</E> This section does not apply to:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Relocation assistance.</E> Relocation assistance under § 1003.602(b), (c), or (d);</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Microenterprises.</E> Assistance to microenterprises as defined by section 102(a)(22) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974; and</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Arms-length transactions.</E> Assistance to a business that purchases business equipment, inventory, or other physical assets in an arms-length transaction, including the assets of an existing business, provided that the purchase does not result in the relocation of the sellers' business operation (including customer base or list, goodwill, product lines, or trade names) from one Identified Service Area to another Identified Service Area and does <PRTPAGE P="745"/>not produce a significant loss of jobs in the Identified Service Area from which the relocation occurs.</P>

Funds may only be used to deal with imminent threats that are not of a recurring nature and which represent a unique and unusual circumstance, and which impact on an entire service area.</P>
              <P>(b) Funds to alleviate imminent threats may be granted only if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of HUD that other tribal or Federal funding sources cannot be made available to alleviate the threat.</P>

              <P>(3) The calculation of the amount of program income for the grantee's ICDBG program as a whole (i.e., comprising activities carried out by a grantee and its subrecipients) shall exclude payments made by subrecipients of principal and/or interest on loans received from grantees where such payments are made from program income received by the subrecipient. (By making such payments, the subrecipient shall be deemed to have transferred program income to the grantee.) The amount of program income derived from this calculation shall be used for reporting purposes and in determining limitations on planning and administration and public services activities to be paid for with ICDBG funds.</P>

              <P>(c) If the change of use occurs after program closeout, the proceeds from the disposition of the real property shall be used for activities which meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subpart C of this part and the primary objective set forth in § 1003.208.</P>
              <P>(d) Following the reimbursement of the ICDBG program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any ICDBG requirements.</P>

              </P>
              <P>(1) All costs to be paid with ICDBG funds have been incurred, with the exception of closeout costs (e.g., audit costs) and costs resulting from contingent liabilities described in the closeout agreement pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Contingent liabilities include, but are not limited to, third-party claims against the grantee, as well as related administrative costs.</P>
              <P>(2) With respect to activities which are financed by means of escrow accounts, loan guarantees, or similar mechanisms, the work to be assisted with ICDBG funds has actually been completed.</P>
              <P>(3) Other responsibilities of the grantee under the grant agreement and applicable laws and regulations appear to have been carried out satisfactorily or there is no further Federal interest in keeping the grant agreement open for the purpose of securing performance.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Closeout actions.</E> (1) Within 90 days of the date it is determined that the criteria for closeout have been met, the grantee shall submit to the Area ONAP a copy of the final status and evaluation report described in § 1003.506(a) and a completed Financial Status Report (SF-269). If acceptable reports are not submitted, an audit of the grantee's program activities may be conducted by HUD.</P>
              <P>(2) Based on the information provided in the status report and other relevant information, the grantee, in consultation with the Area ONAP, will prepare a closeout agreement in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The Area ONAP will cancel any unused portion of the awarded grant, as shown in the signed grant closeout agreement. Any unused grant funds disbursed from the U.S. Treasury which are in the possession of the grantee shall be refunded to HUD.</P>
              <P>(4) Any costs paid with ICDBG funds which were not audited previously shall be subject to coverage in the grantee's next single audit performed in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. The grantee may be required to repay HUD any disallowed costs based on the results of the audit, or on additional HUD reviews provided for in the closeout agreement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Closeout agreement.</E> Any obligations remaining as of the date of the closeout shall be covered by the terms of a closeout agreement. The agreement shall be prepared by the grantee in consultation with the Area ONAP. The agreement shall identify the grant being closed out, and include provisions with respect to the following:</P>

              <P>(4) Description of the grantee's responsibility after closeout for:</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance with all program requirements, certifications and assurances in using program income on deposit at the time the closeout agreement is signed and in using any other remaining ICDBG funds available for closeout costs and contingent liabilities;</P>
              <P>(ii) Use of real property assisted with ICDBG funds in accordance with the principles described in § 1003.504; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Ensuring that flood insurance coverage for affected property owners is maintained for the mandatory period;</P>
              <P>(5) Other provisions appropriate to any special circumstances of the grant closeout, in modification of or in addition to the obligations in paragraphs (c) (1) through (4) of this section. The agreement shall authorize monitoring by HUD, and shall provide that findings of noncompliance may be taken into account by HUD as unsatisfactory performance of the grantee in the consideration of any future grant award under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of grant for convenience.</E> Grant assistance provided under this part may be terminated for convenience in whole or in part before the completion of the assisted activities, in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR 200.339. The grantee shall not incur new obligations for the terminated portions after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. HUD shall <PRTPAGE P="753"/>allow full credit to the grantee for those portions of obligations which could not be canceled and which had been properly incurred by the grantee in carrying out the activities before the termination. The closeout policies contained in this section shall apply in such cases, except where the approved grant is terminated in its entirety. Responsibility for the environmental review to be performed under 24 CFR part 50 or 24 CFR part 58, as applicable, shall be determined as part of the closeout process.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination for cause.</E> In cases in which HUD terminates the grantee's grant under the authority of subpart H of this part, or under the terms of the grant agreement, the closeout policies contained in this section shall apply, except where the approved grant is canceled in its entirety. The provisions in 2 CFR 200.342 on the effects of termination shall also apply.

              <SUBJECT>Indian preference requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Applicability. HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b). Section 7(b) provides that any contract, subcontract, grant or subgrant pursuant to an act authorizing grants to Indian organizations or for the benefit of Indians shall require that, to the greatest extent feasible:</P>
              <P>(1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and</P>
              <P>(2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as defined in section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act [25 U.S.C. 450b] defines “Indian” to mean a person who is a member of an Indian tribe and defines “Indian tribe” to mean any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community including any Alaska native village or regional or village corporation as defined or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided <PRTPAGE P="754"/>by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</P>

              <P>(2) In section 3 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452) <E T="03">economic enterprise</E> is defined as any Indian—owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit, except that Indian ownership must constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise. This act defines <E T="03">Indian organization</E> to mean the governing body of any Indian tribe or entity established or recognized by such governing body.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Preference in administration of grant.</E> To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Preference in contracting.</E> To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</P>
              <P>(1) Each grantee shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Stage 1.</E> Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement or request for proposals limited to Indian-owned firms.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Stage 2.</E> If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Develop, subject to Area ONAP one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference.</P>
              <P>(2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the grantee shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Re-advertise the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Re-advertise the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or</P>
              <P>(iii) If one approvable bid or proposal is received, request Area ONAP review and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.320, in order to award the contract to the single bidder or offeror.</P>
              <P>(3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 2 CFR 200.320 need not follow the formal bid or proposal procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of2 CFR 200.320. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts.</P>
              <P>(4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding or proposal solicitation documents and the bidding and proposal documents.</P>
              <P>(5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. Grantees may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission:</P>
              <P>(i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership and interest;</P>
              <P>(ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved.</P>

              <P>(6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract <PRTPAGE P="755"/>awarded in connection with a project funded under this part:</P>
              <P>(i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible:</P>
              <P>(A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and</P>
              <P>(B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises.</P>
              <P>(ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.</P>
              <P>(iii) In connection with this contract, the contractor shall, to the greatest extent feasible, give preference in the award of any subcontracts to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and preferences and opportunities for training and employment to Indians.</P>
              <P>(iv) The contractor shall include this Section 7(b) clause in every subcontract in connection with the project, and shall, at the direction of the grantee, take appropriate action pursuant to the subcontract upon a finding by the grantee or HUD that the subcontractor has violated the Section 7(b) clause of the Indian Act.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Complaint procedures.</E> The following complaint procedures are applicable to complaints arising out of any of the methods of providing for Indian preference contained in this part, including alternate methods enacted and approved in a manner described in this section:</P>
              <P>(1) Each complaint shall be in writing, signed, and filed with the grantee.</P>
              <P>(2) A complaint must be filed with the grantee no later than 20 calendar days from the date of the action (or omission) upon which the complaint is based.</P>
              <P>(3) Upon receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall promptly stamp the date and time of receipt upon the complaint, and immediately acknowledge its receipt.</P>
              <P>(4) Within 20 calendar days of receipt of a complaint, the grantee shall either meet, or communicate by mail or telephone, with the complainant in an effort to resolve the matter. The grantee shall make a determination on a complaint and notify the complainant, in writing, within 30 calendar days of the submittal of the complaint to the grantee. The decision of the grantee shall constitute final administrative action on the complaint.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> A grantee may withdraw funds from its line of credit for immediate deposit into an escrow account for use in funding loans and grants for the rehabilitation of privately owned residential property under § 1003.202(a)(1). The following additional limitations apply to the use of escrow accounts for residential rehabilitation loans and grants closed after September 7, 1990:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of escrow accounts under this section is limited to loans and grants for the rehabilitation of primarily residential properties containing no more than four dwelling units (and accessory neighborhood-scale non-residential space within the same structure, if any, e.g., a store front below a dwelling unit).</P>
              <P>(2) An escrow account shall not be used unless the contract between the property owner and the contractor selected to do the rehabilitation work specifically provides that payment to the contractor shall be made through an escrow account maintained by the grantee, by a subrecipient as defined in § 1003.4, by a public agency designated under § 1003.500(a), or by an agent under a procurement contact governed by the requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart D. No deposit to the escrow account shall be made until after the contract has been executed between the property owner and the rehabilitation contractor.</P>

              <P>(3) All funds withdrawn under this section shall be deposited into one interest earning account with a financial institution. Separate bank accounts <PRTPAGE P="756"/>shall not be established for individual loans and grants.</P>
              <P>(4) The amount of funds deposited into an escrow account shall be limited to the amount expected to be disbursed within 10 working days from the date of deposit. If the escrow account, for whatever reason, at any time contains funds exceeding 10 days cash needs, the grantee immediately shall transfer the excess funds to its program account. In the program account, the excess funds shall be treated as funds erroneously drawn in accordance with the requirements of U.S. Treasury Financial Manual, paragraph 6-2075.30.</P>
              <P>(5) Funds deposited into an escrow account shall be used only to pay the actual costs of rehabilitation incurred by the owner under the contract with a private contractor. Other eligible costs related to the rehabilitation loan or grant, e.g., the grantee's administrative costs under § 1003.206 or rehabilitation services costs under § 1003.202(b)(9), are not permissible uses of escrowed funds. Such other eligible rehabilitation costs shall be paid under normal ICDBG payment procedures (e.g., from withdrawals of grant funds under the grantee's line of credit with the Treasury).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Interest.</E> Interest earned on escrow accounts established in accordance with this section, less any service charges for the account, shall be remitted to HUD at least quarterly but not more frequently than monthly. Interest earned on escrow accounts is not required to be remitted to HUD to the extent the interest is attributable to the investment of program income.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Remedies for noncompliance.</E> If HUD determines that a grantee has failed to use an escrow account in accordance with this section, HUD may, in addition to imposing any other sanctions provided for under this part, require the grantee to discontinue the use of escrow accounts, in whole or in part.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Temporary relocation.</E> The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move <PRTPAGE P="757"/>permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:</P>
              <P>(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied housing and any increase in monthly housing costs (e.g., rent/utility costs).</P>
              <P>(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:</P>
              <P>(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;</P>
              <P>(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the building/complex following completion of the repairs; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Relocation assistance for displaced persons.</E> A displaced person (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA)(42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional relocation assistance.</E> Under section 105(a)(11) of the Act, the grantee may provide relocation payments and other relocation assistance to persons displaced by a project that is not subject to paragraph (c) of this section. The grantee may also provide relocation assistance to persons receiving assistance under paragraph (c) of this section at levels in excess of those required. For assistance that is not required by State or tribal law, the grantee shall adopt a written policy available to the public that describes the relocation assistance that it has elected to furnish and provides for equal relocation assistance within each class of displaced persons.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Real Property acquisition requirements.</E> The acquisition of real property for an assisted activity is subject to 49 CFR part 24, subpart B. Whenever the grantee does not have the authority to acquire the real property through condemnation, it shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Before discussing the purchase price, inform the owner:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the amount it believes to be the fair market value of the property. Such amount shall be based upon one or more appraisals prepared by a qualified appraiser. However, this provision does not prevent the grantee from accepting a donation or purchasing the real property at less than its fair market value.</P>
              <P>(ii) That it will be unable to acquire the property if negotiations fail to result in an amicable agreement.</P>
              <P>(2) Request HUD approval of the proposed acquisition price before executing a firm commitment to purchase the property. The grantee shall include with its request a copy of the appraisal(s) and, when applicable, a justification for any proposed acquisition payment that exceeds the fair market value of the property. HUD will promptly review the proposal and inform the grantee of its approval or disapproval.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> A person who disagrees with the grantee's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the grantee. A person who is dissatisfied with the grantee's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Area ONAP.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Responsibility of grantee.</E> (1) The grantee shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24. The grantee shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the grantee to comply with these provisions.</P>

              <P>(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. However, such assistance may also be paid for with funds available to the grantee from any other source.<PRTPAGE P="758"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The grantee shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Definition of displaced person.</E> (1) For purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">displaced person</E> means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under this part. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:</P>
              <P>(i) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of an application for financial assistance that is later approved.</P>
              <P>(ii) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, that either HUD or the grantee determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project.</P>
              <P>(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently, after the execution of the agreement between the grantee and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or</P>
              <P>(B) 30 percent of gross household income.</P>
              <P>(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or</P>
              <P>(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:</P>
              <P>(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>
              <P>(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.</P>
              <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>
              <P>(i) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application for financial assistance to HUD, but, before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;</P>
              <P>(ii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2).</P>
              <P>(iii) The grantee determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.</P>
              <P>(3) A grantee may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Definition of initiation of negotiations.</E> For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> (1) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by grantees and subgrantees, the conflict of interest provisions in 2 CFR 200.112, 200.318(c), and 200.319(a)(5) shall apply.</P>

              <P>(2) In all cases not governed by 2 CFR 200.318, the provisions of this section shall apply. Such cases include the provision of assistance by the grantee or <PRTPAGE P="760"/>by its subrecipients to businesses, individuals, and other private entities under eligible activities that authorize such assistance (e.g., rehabilitation, preservation, and other improvements of private properties or facilities under § 1003.202; or grants, loans, and other assistance to businesses, individuals, and other private entities under § 1003.203 or § 1003.204.).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Conflicts prohibited.</E> Except for the use of ICDBG funds to pay salaries and other related administrative or personnel costs, the general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (c) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to ICDBG activities assisted under this part or who are in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from an ICDBG assisted activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or those with whom they have family or business ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Persons covered.</E> The conflict of interest provisions of paragraph (b) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the grantee, or of any designated public agencies, or CBDOs under § 1003.204, receiving funds under this part.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions requiring HUD approval</E>—(1) <E T="03">Threshold requirements.</E> Upon the written request of a grantee, HUD may grant an exception to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section on a case-by-case basis, when it determines that such an exception will serve to further the purposes of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the grantee's program or project. An exception may be considered only after the grantee has provided the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A disclosure of the nature of the possible conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</P>
              <P>(ii) An opinion of the grantee's attorney that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate Tribal laws on conflict of interest, or applicable State laws.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Factors to be considered for exceptions:</E> In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the grantee has satisfactorily met the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, HUD shall consider the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable:</P>
              <P>(i) Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or essential expert knowledge to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;</P>
              <P>(ii) Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;</P>
              <P>(iii) Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or from the decision-making process, with reference to the specific assisted activity in question;</P>
              <P>(iv) Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (b) of this section;</P>
              <P>(v) Whether undue hardship will result, either to the grantee or to the person affected, when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict;</P>
              <P>(vi) Any other relevant considerations.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Circumstances under which the conflict prohibition does not apply.</E> (1) In instances where a person who might otherwise be deemed to be included under the conflict prohibition is a member of a group or class of beneficiaries of the assisted activity and receives generally the same interest or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class, the prohibition does not apply, except that if, by not applying the prohibition against conflict of interest, a violation of Tribal or State laws on conflict of interest would result, the prohibition does apply. However, if the assistance to be provided is housing rehabilitation (or repair) or new housing, a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the specific basis for the selection of the proposed beneficiaries must be <PRTPAGE P="761"/>made prior to the submission of an application to HUD. Evidence of this disclosure must be provided as a component of the application.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> All records pertaining to the grantee's decision under this section shall be maintained for HUD review upon request.</P>

Upon such a referral, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in any United States district court having venue thereof for such relief as may be appropriate, including an action to recover the amount of the assistance furnished under this part which was not expended in accordance with this part or for mandatory or injunctive relief.</P>

            <CITA>[63 FR 12372, Mar. 12, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 48990, Sept. 11, 1998]</CITA>

            <SECTNO>§ 1005.105</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>What are eligible loans?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Only fixed rate, fixed term loans with even monthly payments are eligible under the Section 184 program.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible borrowers.</E> A loan guarantee under section 184 may be made to:</P>
            <P>(1) An Indian family who will occupy the home as a principal residence and who is otherwise qualified under section 184;</P>
            <P>(2) An Indian Housing Authority or Tribally Designated Housing Entity; or</P>
            <P>(3) An Indian tribe.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Appraisal of labor value.</E> The value of any improvements to the property made through the skilled or unskilled labor of the borrower, which may be used to make a payment on account of the balance of the purchase price, must be appraised in accordance with generally acceptable practices and procedures.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Construction advances.</E> The Department may guarantee loans from which advances will be made during construction. The Department will provide guarantees for advances made by the mortgagee during construction if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(1) The mortgagor and the mortgagee execute a building loan agreement, approved by HUD, setting forth the terms and conditions under which advances will be made;</P>
            <P>(2) The advances may be made only as provided in the building loan agreement;</P>
            <P>(3) The principal amount of the mortgage is held by the mortgagee in an interest bearing account, trust, or escrow for the benefit of the mortgagor, pending advancement to the mortgagor or the mortgagor's creditors as provided in the loan agreement; and</P>
            <P>(4) The mortgage shall bear interest on the amount advanced to the mortgagor or the mortgagor's creditors and on the amount held in an account or trust for the benefit of the mortgagor.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Environmental compliance.</E> (1) Section 1000.20 of this chapter applies to an environmental review in connection with a loan guarantee under this part. That section permits an Indian tribe to choose to assume environmental review responsibility.</P>
            <P>(2) Before HUD issues a commitment to guarantee any loan, or before HUD guarantees a loan if there is no commitment, HUD must:</P>
            <P>(i) Comply with environmental review procedures to the extent applicable under part 50 of this title, in accordance with § 1000.20(a) and (c); or</P>
            <P>(ii) Approve a Request for Release of Funds and certification from an Indian tribe, in accordance with part 58 of this title, if the Indian tribe has assumed environmental review responsibility.</P>
            <P>(3) If the loan involves proposed or new construction, HUD will require compliance with procedures comparable to those required by § 203.12(b)(2) of this title for FHA mortgage insurance.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Lack of access to private financial markets.</E> In order to be eligible for a loan guarantee if the property is not on trust or restricted land, the borrower must certify that the borrower lacks access to private financial markets. Borrower certification is the only certification required by HUD.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A loan may be processed under a Direct Guarantee procedure approved by the Department, under which the Department does not issue commitments to guarantee or review applications for loan guarantees before <PRTPAGE P="765"/>mortgages are executed by lenders approved for Direct Guarantee processing. The Department will approve a loan before the loan is guaranteed.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mortgagee sanctions.</E> Depending on the nature and extent of the noncompliance with the requirements applicable to the Direct Guarantee procedure, as determined by the Department, the Department may take such actions as are deemed appropriate and in accordance with published guidelines.</P>

            <SUBJECT>What is eligible collateral?</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A loan guaranteed under section 184 may be secured by any collateral authorized under and not prohibited by Federal, state, or tribal law and determined by the lender and approved by the Department to be sufficient to cover the amount of the loan, and may include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The property and/or improvements to be acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated, to the extent that an interest in such property is not subject to the restrictions against alienation applicable to trust or restricted land;</P>
            <P>(2) A first and/or second mortgage on property other than trust land;</P>
            <P>(3) Personal property; or</P>
            <P>(4) Cash, notes, an interest in securities, royalties, annuities, or any other property that is transferable and whose present value may be determined.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Leasehold of trust or restricted land as collateral.</E> If a leasehold interest in trust or restricted land is used as collateral or security for the loan, the following additional provisions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Approved Lease.</E> Any land lease for a unit financed under Section 184 must be on a form approved by both HUD and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of Interior.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Assumption or sale of leasehold.</E> The lease form must contain a provision requiring tribal consent before any assumption of an existing lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by the Department through foreclosure of the guaranteed mortgage or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A mortgagee other than the Department must obtain tribal consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. Tribal consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including the Department, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is guaranteed or held by the Department.</P>
            <P>(3) The mortgagee or HUD shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the Indian tribe, or the Indian housing authority servicing the Indian tribe or the TDHE servicing the Indian tribe. The mortgagee or HUD shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to one of these three entities.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Priority of loan obligation.</E> Any tribal government whose courts have jurisdiction to hear foreclosures must enact a law providing for the satisfaction of a loan guaranteed or held by the Department before other obligations (other than tribal leasehold taxes against the property assessed after the property is mortgaged) are satisfied.</P>
            <P>(5) <E T="03">Eviction procedures.</E> Before HUD will guarantee a loan secured by trust land, the tribe having jurisdiction over such property must notify the Department that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the guaranteed loan has been foreclosed.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> If the Department determines that the tribe has failed to enforce adequately its eviction procedures, HUD will cease issuing guarantees for loans for tribal members except pursuant to existing commitments. Adequate enforcement is demonstrated where prior evictions have been completed within 60 days after the date of the notice by HUD that foreclosure was completed.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Review.</E> If the Department ceases to issue guarantees in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, HUD will notify the tribe of the reasons for such action and that the tribe may, within 30 days after notification of HUD's action, file a written appeal with the Director, Office of Loan Guarantee (OLG), Office of Native American Programs (ONAP). Within 30 days after notification of an adverse decision by the OLG Director, the tribe may file a written request for review with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for ONAP. <PRTPAGE P="766"/>Upon notification of an adverse decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the tribe has 30 additional days to file an appeal with the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, but the tribe may resubmit the issue to the Assistant Secretary for review at any subsequent time, if new evidence or changed circumstances warrant reconsideration. (Any other administrative actions determined to be necessary to debar a tribe from participating in this program will be subject to the formal debarment procedures contained in 2 CFR part 2424.)</P>

HUD shall establish the amount of the fee by publishing a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and shall deposit any fees collected under this section in the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Fund.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Security for loan.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A loan guaranteed under section 184A of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and this part may be secured by any collateral authorized under and not prohibited by Federal or State law and determined by the lender and approved by HUD to be sufficient to cover the amount of the loan. Eligible collateral may include, but is not limited to, the following:</P>
            <P>(1) The property and/or improvements to be acquired, constructed, or rehabilitated, to the extent that an interest in such property is not subject to any restrictions against alienation applicable to Hawaiian Home Lands;</P>
            <P>(2) A security interest in non-Hawaiian Home Lands property;</P>
            <P>(3) Personal property; or</P>
            <P>(4) Cash, notes, an interest in securities, royalties, annuities, or any other property that is transferable and whose present value may be determined.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hawaiian Home Lands property interest as collateral.</E> If a property interest in Hawaiian Home Lands is used as collateral or security for the loan, the following additional provisions apply:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Approved Lease.</E> Any land lease for a unit financed under section 184A of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 must be on a form approved by both the DHHL and HUD.<PRTPAGE P="786"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Assumption or sale of leasehold.</E> The lease form must contain a provision requiring the DHHL's consent before any assumption of an existing lease, except where title to the leasehold interest is obtained by HUD through foreclosure of the guaranteed mortgage or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. A mortgagee other than HUD must obtain the DHHL's consent before obtaining title through a foreclosure sale. The DHHL's consent must be obtained on any subsequent transfer from the purchaser, including HUD, at foreclosure sale. The lease may not be terminated by the lessor without HUD's approval while the mortgage is guaranteed or held by HUD.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Liquidation.</E> The lender or HUD shall only pursue liquidation after offering to transfer the account to another eligible Native Hawaiian family or the DHHL. The lender or HUD shall not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of or alienate the property except to another eligible Native Hawaiian family or the DHHL.</P>
            <P>(4) <E T="03">Eviction procedures.</E> Before HUD will guarantee a loan secured by a Hawaiian Home Lands property, the DHHL must notify HUD that it has adopted and will enforce procedures for eviction of defaulted mortgagors where the guaranteed loan has been foreclosed.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Enforcement.</E> If HUD determines that the DHHL has failed to enforce adequately its eviction procedures, HUD will cease issuing guarantees for loans under this part except pursuant to existing commitments.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Review.</E> If HUD ceases issuing guarantees for the DHHL's failure to enforce its eviction procedures, HUD shall notify the DHHL of such action and that the DHHL may, within 30 days after notification of HUD's action, file a written appeal with the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Native American Programs (ONAP). Upon notification of an adverse decision by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, the DHHL has 30 additional days to file an appeal with the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The determination of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, but the DHHL may resubmit the issue to the Assistant Secretary for review at any subsequent time if new evidence or changed circumstances warrant reconsideration.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Foreclosure.</E> The holder of the certificate may initiate foreclosure proceedings (after providing written notice of that action to HUD).

HUD's rights will be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee, who shall assign the obligation and security to HUD.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">No foreclosure.</E> Without seeking foreclosure (or in any case in which a foreclosure proceeding initiated under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section continues for a period in excess of 1 year), the holder of the guarantee may submit to HUD a request to assign the obligation and security interest to HUD in return for payment of the claim under the guarantee. HUD may accept assignment of the loan if HUD determines that the assignment is in the best interest of the United States. Upon assignment, HUD will pay to the holder of the guarantee the pro rata portion of the amount guaranteed (as determined under § 1007.60). HUD's rights will be subrogated to the rights of the holder of the guarantee, who shall assign the obligation and security to HUD.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> Before any payment under a guarantee is made under paragraph (a) of this section, the holder of the guarantee shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. HUD will then take such action to collect as HUD determines to be appropriate.</P>
