      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2017), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Determination of sale price of large cigars.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> The tax imposed on large cigars is computed based on the sale price (the price for which the large cigars are sold by the manufacturer). In addition to money, goods or services exchanged for cigars may be considered as part of the sale price.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Special cases</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If there is any question concerning the applicable sale price for tax purposes, the appropriate TTB officer will determine such price, applying rules similar to the constructive sale price rules in 26 U.S.C. 4216(b) and the implementing regulations in 26 CFR 48.4216(b)-1 through 48.4216(b)-4. These constructive sale price rules apply to cigars sold by a manufacturer at retail, sold on consignment, or sold (otherwise than through an arm's length transaction) at less than the fair market price. Sales of cigars between affiliated corporations may be analyzed under the constructive sale price rules. The appropriate TTB officer may make this analysis on his or her own initiative or upon the written request of a manufacturer. If TTB decides it is necessary, we will publish constructive sale price determinations in the TTB Bulletin in accordance with § 70.701(d) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjustments in sale price</E>—(i) <E T="03">Reasons for adjustment.</E> Adjustments to the sale price may occur as a result of a discount or price increase by the manufacturer or as a result of a TTB determination pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) above. In either case, the manufacturer must make conforming changes to the tax that was computed on the sale price before the adjustment.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Time of adjustment.</E> If an adjustment is made before the end of the same tax return period as the original determination of the tax, the adjustment may be made on the same return. If the price is increased or decreased retroactively (during a later return period), either by the manufacturer or by TTB's determination, the manufacturer must make an adjustment on the tax return for the current return period in which the price change was determined.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Amount of adjustment.</E> The taxpayer must compute the adjustment to the tax as the difference between the tax that was paid and the tax that should have been paid, based on the newly determined sale price, together with interest thereon and any applicable penalties. The interest must be computed from the time of payment of the original tax until the time the adjustment was made. Upon request, the appropriate TTB officer will provide information regarding interest rates applicable to specific time periods and any applicable penalties.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Pricing for different packaging.</E> If different bona fide sale prices are applicable to different types of packaging (<E T="03">e. g.,</E> boxes of 25 and boxes of 50), then the cigars in each type of packaging are taxed on the basis of their respective sale prices.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Pricing of seconds.</E> If some of an otherwise identical cigar brand and size:</P>

              <P>(i) Are distinctive from other such cigars because of physical imperfections, <PRTPAGE P="12"/>(ii) Are offered to the consumer through clear labeling as “imperfects”, “seconds”, “throw-outs”, or a comparable commonly understood term, and</P>
              <P>(iii) The manufacturer has a separate sale price for such cigars, then they are taxed on the basis of this separate sale price.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Combination packages.</E> If a manufacturer has a sale price for a combination package containing cigars of different sizes, the cigars are taxed based on that combination sale price. If there is no sale price for the combination, then the cigars are taxed based on their individual sale prices.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Removals for another person.</E> If a manufacturer makes taxable removals of a brand and size of cigar only for distribution by others who establish the sale price, the tax is based on such sale price even though the manufacturer who makes the removals does not establish the price.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Classification.</E> (1) Pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco, before removal subject to tax, must be put up in packages that conform to the requirements of §§ 40.211 and 40.212, and of § 40.216a or § 40.216b as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(2) Any tobacco that has been processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, that does not bear the notice for smokeless tobacco prescribed in § 40.216 or the notice for pipe tobacco prescribed in § 40.216a is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco. A container of processed tobacco, the contents of which weigh 10 pounds or less (including any added non-tobacco ingredients or constituents), that is removed within the meaning of this part for any purpose other than destruction, export, delivery as a sample to a manufacturer of processed tobacco or tobacco products for the purpose of soliciting orders of processed tobacco, or scientific testing or testing of equipment which results in the destruction of the processed tobacco or the return of the processed tobacco to the factory premises, is deemed to be a package offered for sale or delivery to the ultimate consumer.</P>

              <P>(3) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, any tobacco that has been <PRTPAGE P="13"/>processed and that is removed in a package, as that term is defined in § 40.11, is deemed to be roll-your-own tobacco and subject to tax at the rate applicable to roll-your-own tobacco, even though the package bears the notice required for pipe tobacco under § 40.216a, if:</P>
              <P>(i) The package does not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in direct conjunction with, parallel to, and in substantially the same conspicuousness of type and background as the brand name each time the brand name appears on the package; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The package or accompanying materials bear any representation that would suggest a use other than as pipe tobacco. (26 U.S.C. 5702 and 5723) The term 'accompanying materials' includes, but is not limited to, any point of sale advertising or other printed product communications issued by the manufacturer or importer of pipe tobacco products. In addition, the inclusion of cigarette papers or tubes in a package bearing a 'pipe tobacco' declaration will suggest a use other than pipe tobacco.</P>
              <P>(4) During the period from June 22, 2009, through March 23, 2010, manufacturers may continue to remove products as pipe tobacco in packages that do not bear the declaration “pipe tobacco” in the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Manufacturer of tobacco products.</E> Every manufacturer of tobacco products shall pay a special (occupational) tax at a rate specified by § 40.32 of the part. The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the business of manufacturing tobacco products, and thereafter every year on or before July <PRTPAGE P="14"/>1.

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(1) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every manufacturer of tobacco products.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduced rate for small proprietors.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of tobacco products whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 40.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Controlled group.</E> All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Short taxable year.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Returns and allowances.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products by cash, check, or money order, as described in § 40.168, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is <PRTPAGE P="28"/>required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.</P>
                <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, Form 5000.24, for each factory from which tobacco products are withdrawn upon determination of tax.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the tax payment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 40.165 or § 40.167. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.</P>
                <P>(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return on as prescribed by § 40.168. Upon filing the first return which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Remittance.</E> (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, Form 5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by EFT and shall file the return with the TTB, in accordance with the instructions on Form 5000.24.</P>
                <P>(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>

                <P>(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, <PRTPAGE P="29"/>and shall be retained as part of required records.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.</E> The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a tax payment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs Service.</P>

For this purpose <E T="03">day</E> shall mean calendar day, except that the appropriate TTB officer may, upon application of the manufacturer by letter, in duplicate, authorize as such day for a factory a 24-hour cycle of operation other than the calendar day. A day once so established as other than the calendar day may be changed only by another application approved by the appropriate TTB officer. No specific form is required. The manufacturer may use commercial records from which the required information may be readily ascertained for this purpose. The manufacturer shall keep the auxiliary and supplemental records from which such records are compiled and shall keep supporting records, as specified in §§ 40.184 and 40.186, of tobacco products removed subject to tax and transferred in bond. Except as provided in §§ 40.184 and 40.186, the entries in the commercial records so maintained or kept shall be made not later than the close of the next business day following the day on which the transaction(s) occurred. As used in this section the term <E T="03">business day</E> shall mean any day other than Saturday, Sunday, a legal holiday in the District of Columbia, or a statewide legal holiday in the State wherein the factory to which the records relate is located.</P>

                <P>A manufacturer of tobacco products may receive in bond into his factory tobacco products and may also receive into his factory tobacco products on which the tax has been determined (including products on which the tax has been paid). Cigars and cigarettes on which the tax has been determined which are so received shall be segregated and identified as products on which the tax has been determined. If tax determined products received into the factory are so handled that they cannot be identified both physically and in the records as tax determined products they shall be accounted for as returned to bond and upon subsequent removal shall be tax determined. Where returned tax determined tobacco products are to be repackaged without being returned to bond the manufacturer shall make application for authorization to do so to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with § 40.217. Where the manufacturer intends to file claim for credit, allowance, or refund of tax on tax determined products he shall comply with the provisions of §§ 40.311 and 40.313.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Shortages and overages in inventory.</SUBJECT>

                <P>Whenever a manufacturer of tobacco products makes a physical inventory of packaged tobacco products in bond, either as part of normal operations or when required by an appropriate TTB officer, and such inventory discloses a shortage or overage in such products by kind as recorded and reported (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> small cigars, large cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, pipe tobacco, or roll-your-own tobacco), the manufacturer shall enter such shortage or overage in the records required by § 40.183. Shortages or overages in inventories made at different times may not be used to offset each other, but shall be recorded and reported separately. Unless the manufacturer establishes that a shortage was not caused by a removal subject to the tax the manufacturer shall determine the tax on any shortage, make an adjustment in Schedule A of his next semimonthly tax return and pay the tax thereon. If, after paying the tax on a shortage, the manufacturer satisfactorily establishes that the shortage was not caused by a removal subject to tax, then such payment would be an overpayment of tax which the manufacturer may recover as provided in § 40.286. Where the manufacturer can establish prior to paying the tax on a shortage, that the shortage was not the result of a removal subject to tax he shall submit an explanation of such shortage with his report for the month in which the shortage was disclosed and, if appropriate, he may file claim for remission of tax liability as provided in § 40.287. When an overage is disclosed which the manufacturer can explain, he shall include such explanation in his monthly report and refund of any overpayment may be recovered as provided in § 40.286. Whenever a physical inventory discloses a shortage or overage of tobacco products which have not been packaged the manufacturer shall appropriately enter such shortage or overage in his records and shall, at the time required by the appropriate TTB officer, furnish an explanation in the form of a claim for remission of tax liability as provided in § 40.287. The manufacturer shall pay the tax on any shortage or portion thereof for which he is unable to furnish an explanation acceptable to the appropriate TTB officer.</P>

                <P>Relief from the payment of tax on tobacco products may be extended to a manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the tobacco products after removal from the factory upon determination of tax and prior to the payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of the manufacturer who removed such products, or are withdrawn by him from the market. Any claim for allowance under this section shall be filed on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, with the appropriate TTB officer, and shall show the date the tobacco products were removed from the factory. A claim relating to products lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.301. In the case of a claim relating to tobacco products withdrawn from the market the schedule prescribed in § 40.311 shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of his claim by making the adjusting entry in a tax return pending consideration and action on the claim. Tobacco products to which such a claim relates must be shown as removed on determination of tax in the return covering the period during which such products were so removed. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When such notification of allowance of the claim or any part thereof is received prior to the time the return covering the tax on the tobacco products to which the claim relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the notice of allowance is received after the filing of the return <PRTPAGE P="41"/>and taxpayment of the tobacco products to which the claim relates, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance.</P>

Any claim for credit or refund under this section shall be prepared on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. Claims shall include a statement that the tax imposed on tobacco products by 26 U.S.C. 7652 or chapter 52, was paid in respect to the tobacco products covered by the claim, and that the products were lost, destroyed, or withdrawn from the market within 6 months preceding the date the claim is filed. A claim for credit or refund relating to products lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.301, and a claim relating to products withdrawn from the market shall be accompanied by a schedule prepared and verified as prescribed in §§ 40.311 and 40.313. The original and one copy of TTB F 5620.8, claim for credit, or the original of TTB F 5620.8, claim for refund, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer.

                <SUBJECT>Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes in any other form of remittance, as authorized in § 40.355, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.</P>

                <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR §§ 1.563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one <PRTPAGE P="47"/>taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate return, TTB Form 5000.24, for each factory from which cigarette papers or cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Department of the Treasury's General Account or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 40.355. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.</P>
                <P>(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 41 of this chapter during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by § 40.355. Upon filing the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to TTB Form 5000.24, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Remittance.</E> (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the return, TTB Form 5000.24, information about remitting the tax for that return period by EFT and shall file the return with TTB, in accordance with the instructions of TTB Form 5000.24.</P>
                <P>(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by EFT is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by EFT shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
                <P>(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an EFT message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.</E> The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer an TTB Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer is to follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this part. The U.S. Customs Service will provide the taxpayer with instructions for preparing EFT remittances for payments to be made to the U.S. Customs Service.</P>

                <P>Whenever any person required by law to pay tax on cigarette papers and tubes fails to pay such tax, the tax shall be ascertained and assessed against such person, subject to the limitations prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 6501. The tax so assessed shall be in addition to the penalties imposed by law for failure to pay such tax when required. Except in cases where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error, no such assessment shall be made until and after notice has been afforded such person to show cause against assessment. The person will be allowed 45 days from the date of such notice to show cause, in writing, against such assessment.</P>

The tax shall be paid on or before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Each place of business taxable.</E> A manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the <PRTPAGE P="49"/>entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(2) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduced rate for small proprietors.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 40.371 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Controlled group.</E> All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Short taxable year.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Returns and allowances.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>

Where the cigarette papers or tubes are not sold the officer may deliver them to a Federal or State institution (if they are fit for consumption) or cause their destruction by burning completely or by rendering them unfit for consumption. Where such papers or tubes are sold, release by the officer having custody shall be made only after such papers and tubes are properly packaged and taxpaid. A receipt from the appropriate TTB officer evidencing payment of tax on such papers or tubes shall be presented to the officer having custody of the articles, which tax shall be considered part of the sales price. Where cigarette papers or tubes which have been packaged under the provisions of part 45 of this chapter are to be released after payment of tax, the purchaser shall appropriately mark each package “Federal Tax Paid (date)” before the officer having custody of the papers or tubes releases them. However, the articles may be released without such marking of the packages if the purchaser is a qualified manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes and does not intend to place such papers or tubes on the domestic market for taxable articles but will otherwise dispose of them. A written statement of notification of disposal by destruction or return to bond through claim for refund, shall be filed, in original only, with the officer having custody of the articles. In the case of cigarette papers and tubes forfeited under the internal revenue laws, the sale shall be subject to the provisions of part 72 of this chapter.</P>

The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered.

                <P>Relief from the payment of tax on cigarette papers and tubes may be extended to a manufacturer by allowance of the tax where the cigarette papers and tubes, after removal from the factory upon determination of tax and prior to the payment of such tax, are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of the manufacturer who removed such articles, or are withdrawn by the manufacturer from the market. Any claim for allowance under this section shall be filed on TTB F 5620.8 with the appropriate TTB officer, shall be executed under penalties and perjury and shall show the date the cigarette papers and tubes were removed from the factory. A claim relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.475. In the case of a claim relating to cigarette papers or tubes withdrawn from the market the schedule prescribed in § 40.476 shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The <PRTPAGE P="58"/>manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by making the adjusting entry in a tax return pending consideration and action on the claim. Cigarette papers and tubes to which such a claim relates must be shown as removed on determination of tax in the return covering the period during which such articles were so removed. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer a copy of TTB F 5620.8 will be returned to the manufacturer as notice of such action. This copy of TTB F 5620.8, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When such notification of allowance of the claim or any part thereof is received prior to the time the return covering the tax on the cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim relates is to be filed, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in that tax return. Where the notice of allowance is received after the filing of the return and taxpayment of the cigarette papers or tubes to which the claim relates, the manufacturer may make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance.</P>

                <P>The taxes paid on cigarette papers and tubes may be credited or refunded (without interest) to a manufacturer on proof satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer that the claimant manufacturer paid the tax on cigarette papers and tubes lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of such manufacturer, or withdrawn by the manufacturer from the market. Any claim for credit or refund under this section shall be prepared on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate. Claims shall include a statement that the tax imposed on cigarette papers and tubes by 26 U.S.C. 7652 or Chapter 52, was paid in respect to the cigarette papers or tubes covered by the claim, and that the articles were lost, destroyed, or withdrawn from the market within 6 months preceding the date the claim is filed. A claim for credit or refund relating to articles lost or destroyed shall be supported as prescribed in § 40.475, and a claim relating to articles withdrawn from the market shall be accompanied by a schedule prepared and verified as prescribed in §§ 40.476, and 40.477. The original and one copy of TTB F 5620.8, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. Upon action by the appropriate TTB officer on a claim for credit, a copy of TTB F 5620.8 will be returned to the manufacturer as notification of allowance or disallowance of the claim or any part thereof. This copy, with the copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer. When the manufacturer is notified of allowance of the claim for credit or any part thereof, the manufacturer shall make an adjusting entry and explanatory statement in the next tax return(s) to the extent necessary to take credit in the amount of the allowance. The manufacturer may not anticipate allowance of a claim by taking credit on a tax return prior to consideration and action on such claim. The duplicate of a claim for refund or credit, with a copy of any verified supporting schedules, shall be retained by the manufacturer.</P>

Where cigarette papers and tubes are so lost or destroyed the manufacturer shall report promptly such fact, and the circumstances, to the appropriate TTB officer. If the manufacturer wishes to be relieved of the tax liability, a claim on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, shall also be prepared, setting forth the nature, date, place, and extent of the loss or destruction.

The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The importer shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered.

                <P>(a) Each importer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on cigars, cigarettes, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of such taxes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of such taxes by cash, check, or money order is not authorized for an importer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability on all taxable withdrawals and importations (including similar products brought into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer.</P>
                <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(c) For the purposes of this section, (1) electronic fund transfer or EFT means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer of magnetic tape, so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to either debit or credit an account, in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. Customs Service, and (2) electronic fund transfer or EFT does not have the meaning defined in § 41.11 for use elswhere in this part.</P>
                <P>(d) An importer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make the EFT remittance in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Customs Service.</P>

                <P>(a) The provisions of this section apply to tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes manufactured in the United States and labeled for exportation under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(b) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may be transferred to or removed from the premises of a manufacturer or an export warehouse proprietor only if such articles are being transferred or removed without tax as provided in this part.</P>
                <P>(c) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may only be imported or brought into the United States, after their exportation, under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5704(d), by release from Customs custody for delivery to the original manufacturer of such tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes or to the proprietor of an export warehouse authorized by such manufacturer to receive such articles. These products are transferred in bond and are released from Customs custody without payment of that part of the duty attributable to internal revenue tax.</P>

However, because such articles are also eligible for release under 26 U.S.C. 5704(d), such articles will be treated as though released under section 5704(d), due to the penalty provisions in section 5761(c).</P>
                <P>(e) Articles described in paragraph (a) of this section may not be sold or held for sale for domestic consumption in the United States unless such articles are removed from their export packaging and repackaged by the original manufacturer into new packaging that does not contain an export label. The new packages, marks and notices must conform to the requirements of 27 CFR part 270.</P>
                <P>(f) The provisions of this section shall apply to articles labeled for export even if the packaging or the appearance of such packaging to the consumer of such articles has been modified or altered by a person other than the original manufacturer so as to remove or conceal or attempt to remove or conceal (including by placement of a sticker over) any export label.</P>
                <P>(g) For purposes of this section, an article is labeled for export or contains an export label if it bears the mark, label, or notice required by § 44.185 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>(h) For purposes of this section, references to exportation shall be treated as including a reference to shipment to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</P>

                <P>(i) The provisions of this section do not apply to any person who, when entering U.S. manufactured tobacco products labeled for export under parts 44 and 270 of this chapter, claims and is granted an exemption from duty and tax for such products under chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The quantity of tobacco products entered may not exceed the quantity limit imposed on such products under the applicable tariff provision.

                <P>The internal revenue taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. 7652(a), with respect to tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and shipped to the United States on computation of tax under the provisions of this subpart shall be paid on the basis of a semimonthly tax return. The bonded manufacturer of such products shall prepare TTB Form 5000.25 in duplicate, and file the original with the appropriate TTB officer, and maintain one copy for the file for each semimonthly return period. The bonded manufacturer shall execute the return, TTB Form 5000.25, under the penalties of perjury. He shall file a return for each return period at the time specified in § 41.114, regardless of whether tax is due for that return period. However, where the appropriate TTB officer, grants specific authorization, the bonded manufacturer need not file a tax return during the term of such authorization for any period in which tax liability was not incurred under the provisions of this subpart.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> (1) Each taxpayer who was liable, during a calendar year, for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter, shall use a commercial bank in making payment by electronic fund transfer (EFT) of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the succeeding calendar year. Payment of taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes by cash, check, or money order, as described in § 41.115, is not authorized for a taxpayer who is required, by this section, to make remittances by EFT. For purposes of this section, the dollar amount of tax liability is defined as the gross tax liability of all taxes which are paid in accordance with this subpart, taxable withdrawals from premises in the United States, and importations during the calendar year, without regard to any drawbacks, credits, or refunds, for all premises from which such activities are conducted by the taxpayer. Overpayments are not taken into account in summarizing the gross tax liability.</P>

                <P>(2) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer includes a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563, and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place it appears in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled <PRTPAGE P="92"/>group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of determining who is required to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(3) A taxpayer who is required by this section to make remittances by EFT, shall make a separate EFT remittance and file a separate tax return for each factory which tobacco products, or cigarette papers, or cigarette tubes are withdrawn upon determination of tax.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) On or before January 10 of each calendar year, except for a taxpayer already remitting the tax by EFT, each taxpayer who was liable for a gross amount equal to or exceeding five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes combining tax liabilities incurred under this part and part 40 of this chapter during the previous calendar year, shall notify, in writing, the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be an agreement to make remittances by EFT.</P>
                <P>(2) For each return filed in accordance with this part, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's bank to make an electronic fund transfer in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request shall be made to the bank early enough for the transfer to be made to the Treasury Account by no later than the close of business on the last day for filing the return, prescribed in § 41.105 or § 41.114. The request shall take into account any time limit established by the bank.</P>
                <P>(3) If a taxpayer was liable for less than five million dollars in taxes on tobacco products, cigarette papers, and cigarette tubes during the preceding calendar year, the taxpayer may choose either to continue remitting the tax as provided in this section or to remit the tax with the return as prescribed by § 41.115. On the first return on which the taxpayer chooses to discontinue remitting the tax by EFT and to begin remitting the tax with the tax return, the taxpayer shall notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax return, stating that no taxes are due by EFT, because the tax liability during the preceding calendar year was less than five million dollars, and that the remittance shall be filed with the tax return.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Remittance.</E> (1) Each taxpayer shall show on the tax return, information about remitting the tax for that return by EFT and shall file the return with the appropriate TTB officer.</P>
                <P>(2) Remittances shall be considered as made when the taxpayment by electronic fund transfer is received by the Treasury Account. For purposes of this section, a taxpayment by electronic fund transfer shall be considered as received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
                <P>(3) When the taxpayer directs the bank to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, any transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer, through normal banking procedures, will serve as the record of payment, and shall be retained as part of required records.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.</E> The taxpayer is subject to a penalty imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5761, 6651, or 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a taxpayment by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for filing.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer a TTB Procedure entitled, Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer must follow when preparing returns and EFT remittances under this part.</P>

              <P>Every person who imports large cigars for sale within the United States must keep such records as are necessary to establish and verify the sale price that applies to large cigars removed (entered or withdrawn).</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Basic record.</E> The importer must keep a record to show each sale price (as determined under § 41.39), which is applicable to large cigars removed. No later than the tenth business day in January of each year the importer must prepare such a record to show the sale price in effect on the first day of that year for each brand and size of large cigars. The importer must note any change in a price from that shown in the record within ten business days after such change in price. The record must be a continuing one for each brand and size of cigar (and type of packaging, if pertinent), so that the taxable price on any date may be readily ascertained. If an importer removes new types of large cigars after the beginning of the year, the importer must enter the sale price and its effective date for such large cigars in the basic <PRTPAGE P="100"/>record within ten business days after such removal.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Copies of price announcements.</E> The importer must keep a copy of each general announcement that is issued internally or to the trade about establishment or change of large cigar sale prices. If the copy does not show the actual date when issued it must be annotated to show this information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Copies of entry and withdrawal forms.</E> The importer must keep a copy of each customs entry or withdrawal form on which internal revenue tax for large cigars is declared pursuant to § 41.81.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Alternative record.</E> If an importer has so few import transactions and/or brands and sizes of large cigars that retention of an appropriate copy of each entry and withdrawal form required under paragraph (c) of this section will provide an adequate record of sale prices, then the record required under paragraph (a) of this section need not be kept. In such case the entry and withdrawal forms must identify the brands and sizes of cigars covered and show the corresponding quantity and sale price for each. If such information was not originally entered on the form it may be included by annotation. Whenever the appropriate TTB officer finds that alternative records being kept pursuant to this paragraph are inadequate for the intended purpose, he or she may so notify the importer in writing, after which time the importer must keep the record required under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

                <P>If the application for a permit or authorization or any report or other document required to be executed under this subpart is to be signed by an individual (including one of the partners for a partnership or one of the members of an association) as an attorney in fact for any person, or if an individual is otherwise to officially represent such person, power of attorney on TTB F 5000.8 shall be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer. Such power of attorney is not required for persons whose authority is furnished with the corporate documents as required by § 41.234. Form 5000.8 does not have to be filed again with an appropriate TTB officer where such form has previously been submitted to TTB and is still in effect.</P>

                <P>Where the appropriate TTB officer has reason to believe that an importer of processed tobacco has not in good faith complied with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, and regulations thereunder, or with any other provision of 26 U.S.C. with intent to defraud, or has violated any condition of his <PRTPAGE P="113"/>permit, or has failed to disclose any material information required or made any material false statement in the application for the permit, or is, by reason of previous or current legal proceedings involving a felony violation of any other provision of Federal criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, not likely to maintain operations in compliance with 26 U.S.C. chapter 52, or has been convicted of a felony violation of any provision of Federal or State criminal law relating to tobacco products, processed tobacco, cigarette paper, or cigarette tubes, the appropriate TTB officer shall issue an order, stating the facts charged, citing such person to show cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked. Such citation shall be issued and opportunity for hearing afforded in accordance with part 71 of this chapter, which part is applicable to such proceedings. If, after hearing, the hearing examiner, or on appeal, the Administrator, finds that such person has not shown cause why his permit should not be suspended or revoked, such permit shall be suspended for such period as the appropriate TTB officer deems proper or shall be revoked.</P>

The tax shall be paid on or before the date of commencing the business of an export warehouseman, and thereafter every year on or before July 1. On commencing business, the tax shall be computed from the first day of the month in which liability is incurred, through the following June 30. Thereafter, the tax shall be computed for the entire year (July 1 through June 30).</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Each place of business taxable.</E> An export warehouse proprietor under this part incurs special tax liability at each place of business in which an occupation subject to special tax is conducted. A place of business means the entire office, plant or area of the business in any one location under the same proprietorship. Passageways, streets, highways, rail crossings, waterways, or partitions dividing the premises are not sufficient separation to require additional special tax, if the divisions of the premises are otherwise contiguous.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment of tax.</E> Special tax must be paid by return. The prescribed return is TTB Form 5630.5t, Special Tax Registration and Return—Tobacco. Special tax returns, with payment of tax, must be filed with TTB in accordance with the instructions on the form and the requirements of subpart D of part 46 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(a)(3) imposes a special tax of $1,000 per year on every export warehouse proprietor.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Reduced rate for small proprietors.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 5731(b) provides for a reduced rate of $500 per year with respect to any export warehouse proprietor whose gross receipts (for the most recent taxable year ending before the first day of the taxable period to which the special tax imposed by § 44.31 relates) are less than $500,000. The “taxable year” to be used for determining gross receipts is the taxpayer's income tax year. All gross receipts of the taxpayer shall be included, not just the gross receipts of the business subject to special tax. Proprietors of new businesses that have not yet begun a taxable year, as well as proprietors of existing businesses that have not yet <PRTPAGE P="119"/>ended a taxable year, who commence a new activity subject to special tax, qualify for the reduced special (occupational) tax rate, unless the business is a member of a “controlled group”; in that case, the rules of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Controlled group.</E> All persons treated as one taxpayer under 26 U.S.C. 5061(e)(3) shall be treated as one taxpayer for the purpose of determining gross receipts under paragraph (b) of this section. “Controlled group” means a controlled group of corporations, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 1563 and implementing regulations in 26 CFR 1.1563-1 through 1.1563-4, except that the words “at least 80 percent” shall be replaced by the words “more than 50 percent” in each place they appear in subsection (a) of 26 U.S.C. 1563, as well as in the implementing regulations. Also, the rules for a “controlled group of corporations” apply in a similar fashion to groups which include partnerships and/or sole proprietorships. If one entity maintains more than 50% control over a group consisting of corporations and one, or more, partnerships and/or sole proprietorships, all of the members of the controlled group are one taxpayer for the purpose of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Short taxable year.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year of less than 12 months shall be annualized by multiplying the gross receipts for the short period by 12 and dividing the result by the number of months in the short period as required by 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Returns and allowances.</E> Gross receipts for any taxable year shall be reduced by returns and allowances made during such year under 26 U.S.C. 448(c)(3).</P>

Deliveries may be made to vessels actually engaged in foreign, intercoastal, or noncontiguous territory trade (i.e., vessels operating on a regular schedule in trade or actually transporting passengers and/or cargo (a) between a port in the United States and a foreign port; (b) between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States; or (c) between a port on the mainland of the United States and a port in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States; between a port in Alaska and a port in Hawaii; or between a port in Alaska or Hawaii and a port in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States); to vessels clearing through customs for a port beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States; to vessels of war or other governmental activity; or to vessels of the United States documented to engage in the fishing business (including the whaling business), and foreign fishing (including whaling) vessels of 5 net tons or over. Such deliveries to vessels shall be subject to lading under customs supervision as provided in §§ 44.207 and 44.263. As a condition to the lading of the tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, the customs authorities at the port of lading may, if they deem it necessary in order to protect the revenue, require assurances, satisfactory to them, from the master of the receiving vessel that the quantities to be laden are reasonable, considering the number of persons to be carried, the vessel's itinerary, the duration of its intended voyage, etc., and that such articles are to be used exclusively as supplies on the voyage. For this purpose, the customs authorities may require the master of the receiving vessel to submit, prior to lading, customs documentation for permission to lade the articles. Where the customs authorities allow only a portion of a shipment to be laden, the remainder of the shipment shall be returned to the bonded premises of the manufacturer, export warehouse proprietor, or customs warehouse proprietor making the shipment, or otherwise disposed of as approved by the appropriate TTB officer. Deliveries may be made to aircraft that are clearing through customs and that are enroute to a place beyond the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United States, and to aircraft operating on a regular schedule between U.S. customs areas as defined in the Air Commerce Regulations (19 CFR part 122). Deliveries may not be made to a vessel or aircraft stationed in the United States for an indefinite period and where its schedule does not include operations outside such jurisdiction.</P>

              <P>A manufacturer, on specific approval by the appropriate TTB officer as provided in this section, may use an alternate method or procedure in lieu of a method or procedure specifically prescribed in this part. The appropriate TTB officer may approve an alternate method or procedure, subject to stated conditions, when he finds that:</P>
              <P>(a) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue, and</P>
              <P>(c) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.</P>
              <FP>No alternate method or procedure relating to the giving of any bond or to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax, shall be authorized under this section. Where a manufacturer desires to employ an alternate method or procedure, the manufacturer must submit a written application to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall specifically describe the proposed alternate method or procedure, and shall set forth the reasons therefor. Alternate methods or procedures shall not be employed until the application has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. The manufacturer shall, during the period of authorization of an alternate method or procedure, comply with the terms of the approved application. Authorization for any alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered. The manufacturer shall retain, as part of his records, any authorization of the appropriate TTB officer under this section for three years following the close of the calendar year in which the operation under such authorization is concluded.</FP>

Authority for any variations may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such variation. Where a manufacturer desires to employ such variation, the manufacturer must submit a written application to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall describe the proposed variations and set forth the reasons therefor. Variations shall not be employed until the application has been approved.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Preparation of TTB Form 5630.5t.</E> Every manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, and export warehouse proprietor is required to pay special (occupational) tax and file a return on TTB Form 5630.5t, “Special Tax Registration and Return—Tobacco.” TTB Form 5630.5t must be completed in accordance with the instructions on the form, and all of the information called for on the form must be provided, including the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Name of the taxpayer.</P>
                <P>(2) Trade name(s) (if any) of the business(es) subject to special (occupational) tax.</P>
                <P>(3) Employer identification number (see § 46.102).</P>
                <P>(4) Exact location of the place of business, by name and number of building or street, or if these do not exist, by some specific description in addition to the post office address. In the case of one return for two or more locations, the address to be shown must be the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer).</P>
                <P>(5) Class(es) of special tax to which the taxpayer is subject.</P>
                <P>(6) Ownership and control information. This consists of the name, position, and residence address of every owner of the business and of every person having power to control its management and policies with respect to the activity subject to special tax. “Owner of the business” includes every partner, if the taxpayer is a partnership, and every person owning 10 percent or more of its stock, if the taxpayer is a corporation. However, the ownership and control information required by this paragraph need not be stated if the same information has been previously provided to TTB in connection with a permit application and that previously provided information is still current.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Multiple locations and/or classes of tax.</E> A taxpayer subject to special tax for the same period at more than one location or for more than one class of tax must—</P>
                <P>(1) File one special tax return, TTB Form 5630.5t, with payment of tax, to cover all such locations and classes of tax; and</P>
                <P>(2) Prepare, in duplicate, a list identified with the taxpayer's name, address (as shown on TTB Form 5630.5t), employer identification number, and period covered by the return. The list must show, by State, the name, address, and tax class of each location for which special tax is being paid. The original of the list must be filed with TTB as an attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t, and the copy must be retained at the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office, in the case of a corporate taxpayer) for a period of three years from the date of the return.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Signing of TTB Form 5630.5t</E>—(1) <E T="03">By principal.</E> The return of an individual proprietor must be signed by the individual. The return of a partnership must be signed by a general partner. The return of a corporation must be signed by an officer. In each case, the person signing the return must designate his or her capacity as “individual owner,” “member of firm,” or, in the case of a corporation, the officer's title.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">By fiduciary.</E> A receiver, trustee, assignee, executor, administrator, or <PRTPAGE P="170"/>other legal representative who continues the business of a bankrupt, insolvent, deceased, or otherwise incapacitated person must indicate the capacity in which the fiduciary acts.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">By agent or attorney in fact.</E> If a return is signed by an agent or attorney in fact, the signature must be preceded by the name of the principal and followed by the title of the agent or attorney in fact. A return signed by a person as agent will not be accepted unless there is filed, with the TTB office with which the return is required to be filed, a power of attorney authorizing the agent to perform the act.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Perjury statement.</E> Each TTB Form 5630.5t must contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that the return has been executed under the penalties of perjury.</P>

Failure of the taxpayer to include the employer identification number may result in the imposition of the penalty specified in § 70.113 of this chapter.</P>

The taxpayer must apply for and be assigned only one employer identification number, regardless of the number of places of business for which the taxpayer is required to file a special tax return. The taxpayer must apply for the employer identification number no later than 7 days after the filing of the taxpayer's first special (occupational) tax return. IRS Form SS-4 may be obtained from the director of an IRS service center, from any IRS district director, or from <E T="03">http://www.irs.gov/.</E>

If the postmark is not legible, the sender has the burden of proving the date when the postmark was made. When registered mail is used, the date of registration will be accepted as the postmark date. When certified mail is used, the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail is treated as the postmark date.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Failure to file return.</E> Any person required by this subpart to file a return on TTB Form 5630.5t who fails to file the return on or before the date for filing prescribed in § 46.103 must pay, in addition to the tax, a delinquency penalty, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect (see § 46.109). The delinquency penalty for failure to file the return on or before the last date prescribed will be 5 percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the return if the failure to file is for not more than one month; with an additional 5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the delinquency continues, but not more than 25 percent in the aggregate.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Failure to pay tax.</E> Any person who files a return on TTB Form 5630.5t under this subpart and who fails to pay the amount shown as tax on the return on or before the date prescribed in § 46.103 for payment of such tax, must pay a penalty, in addition to the tax, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect (see § 46.109). The penalty for failure to pay the tax on or before the date prescribed for payment is 0.5 percent of the amount shown as tax on the return if the failure to pay is not for more than one month; with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not more than 25 percent in the aggregate. Any person required to pay the special tax who willfully fails to pay the tax shall be fined not more than $5,000, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both, for each such offense.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> With respect to any return on Form 5630.5t, the amount of the addition under paragraph (a) of this section will be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (b) of this section for any month to which an addition to tax applies under both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of this section. If the amount of tax required to be shown as tax on the return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, the penalties prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be applied by substituting that lower amount.</P>

                <P>In every case where a special tax return is not filed, or the tax is not paid, at the time prescribed in § 46.103, the delinquency penalties specified in § 46.107 for failure to file a return or for failure to pay the amount shown as tax on the return will be asserted and collected unless a reasonable cause for delay in filing the return or payment of the tax is clearly established. A taxpayer who believes the circumstances <PRTPAGE P="172"/>that delayed such taxpayer's filing of the return or payment of the tax are reasonable, and who desires to have the penalties waived, must submit with the return a written statement under the penalty of perjury, affirmatively showing all of the circumstances alleged as reasonable causes for delay. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful neglect or gross negligence, the addition to the tax will be waived. If the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time, or if the taxpayer made a satisfactory showing that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of the tax liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would have suffered an undue hardship if the taxpayer had paid on the due date, then the delay is due to reasonable cause. Mere ignorance of the law will not be considered a reasonable cause.</P>

If the return covers multiple locations, TTB will send to the taxpayer's principal place of business (or principal office in the case of a corporate taxpayer) one appropriately designated stamp for each location listed on the attachment to TTB Form 5630.5t required by § 46.101(b)(2).</P>

The taxpayer must then forward each stamp to the place of business designated on the stamp. Incorrect stamps must be returned to the appropriate TTB officer as provided in § 46.120.</P>

However, if the error was in the taxpayer's preparation of the Form 5630.5t, the appropriate TTB officer will require the taxpayer to file a new Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” setting forth the taxpayer's correct name and address, and a statement explaining the error on the original Form 5630.5t. On receipt of the amended Form 5630.5t and a satisfactory explanation of the error, the appropriate TTB officer will make the proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer.</P>

The taxpayer must attach the special tax stamp or stamps for endorsement of the change in location. No new special tax is required to be paid.

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> If the taxpayer's original return on TTB Form 5630.5t covered only one location, the taxpayer may deliver the amended return and the stamp at any TTB office, or to any TTB officer inspecting the business, in lieu of mailing them to TTB. If the taxpayer's original return covered multiple locations under the provisions of § 46.101(b), he or she must forward with the amended return an attachment showing both the old and new address of any place of business which has been relocated, and the special tax stamp covering the location from which the business was removed. The appropriate TTB officer receiving such return or stamp will, if the return is submitted within the 30-day period, enter the proper endorsement on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Change in ownership.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> A special tax stamp is a receipt for tax, personal to the one to whom issued, and is not transferable from one manufacturer of tobacco products, manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, or export warehouse proprietor to another. If there is a change in the ownership of a special-tax payer, the successor must pay a new special (occupational) tax and obtain the required special tax stamp(s). Examples of changes in ownership that require payment of a new special tax include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
                <P>(1) Sale of business;</P>
                <P>(2) Formation of a partnership by two persons who have paid special tax;</P>
                <P>(3) Addition of a partner;</P>
                <P>(4) Incorporation of the business;</P>
                <P>(5) Creation of a new corporation to replace one or more corporations that have paid special tax; and</P>
                <P>(6) Stockholder continuing the business of a corporation after its dissolution.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Changes that do not require payment of a new special tax.</E> The following changes do not require payment of a special tax:</P>
                <P>(1) Increase in capital stock of a corporation.</P>

                <P>(2) Change in ownership of any or all of the capital stock of a corporation.<PRTPAGE P="174"/>
                </P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Exemption for certain successors.</E> Persons identified in paragraph (d) of this section as having the right of succession may carry on the business for the remainder of the tax year for which the special tax was paid, without paying a new special tax, if within 30 days after the date on which the successor begins to carry on the business, the successor files with TTB a special tax return on TTB Form 5630.5t showing the basis of succession. A person who is a successor to a business for which special tax has been paid, and who fails to register the succession, is liable for special tax computed from the first day of the calendar month in which the successor began to carry on the business.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Persons having right of succession.</E> The right of succession referred to in paragraph (c) of this section will pass to the identified persons in the following circumstances:</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Death.</E> The surviving spouse or child, or the executor, administrator, or other legal representative, of a deceased taxpayer;</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Succession of spouse.</E> A husband or wife succeeding to the business of his or her living spouse;</P>

                <P>(4) <E T="03">Withdrawal from firm.</E> The partner or partners remaining after the death or withdrawal of a member of a partnership.

                <P>If a taxpayer through error has filed a return and paid special tax for an incorrect period of liability or for an incorrect class of business, the taxpayer must prepare a corrected TTB Form 5630.5t, designated “Amended Return,” for each tax year involved and must submit the amended return, or returns, with remittance for the total applicable tax and additions to the tax (delinquency penalties and interest), to TTB in accordance with the instructions on the Form 5630.5t or, if the error is discovered by a TTB officer inspecting the premises, to that officer. Subject to the limitations imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6511, the incorrectly paid tax (including additions thereto) may be allowed as a credit against the correct tax (including any additions thereto), as provided in § 46.132, on surrender of the incorrect stamp or stamps, with the amended return or returns noted to show that credit is requested. Any incorrectly paid tax (including additions thereto) that is not credited as provided in § 46.132, including any creditable tax and additions thereto in excess of the correct tax (including additions thereto), may be refunded pursuant to §§ 46.136 through 46.138 if the taxpayer files a corrected return on Form 5630.5t with remittance of the correct amount of tax (including any additions thereto).

              <P>(a) All tobacco products purchased, received, possessed, offered for sale, sold or otherwise disposed of, by any dealer must be in proper packages which bear the mark or notice as prescribed in parts 40 and 41 of this chapter. Tobacco products may be sold, or offered for sale, at retail from such packages, provided the products remain in the packages until removed by the customer or in the presence of the customer. Where a vending machine is used, tobacco products must similarly be vended in proper packages or directly from such packages.</P>

This applies to articles labeled for export even if the packaging or the appearance of such packaging to the consumer of such articles has been modified or altered by a person other than the original manufacturer so as to remove or conceal or attempt to remove or conceal (including by placement of a sticker over) the export label.</P>

                <P>(2) If the shipment is free on board (F.O.B.) shipping point, the title transfer occurs at the time and place of shipment, which is generally by common carrier.</P>

                <P>If articles subject to floor stocks tax are stored in a foreign trade zone established under the Foreign Trade Zone Act (the Act of June 18, 1934, 48 Stat. 998, 19 U.S.C. 81a <E T="03">et seq.</E>), the dealer is liable for the tax and must take an inventory in accordance with § 46.207 or when either of the following conditions apply:</P>
                <P>(a) Internal revenue taxes have been determined or customs duties liquidated, with respect to the articles pursuant to the first proviso of section 3(a) of the Foreign Trade Zone Act; or</P>
                <P>(b) Articles are held by a customs officer pursuant to the second proviso of section 3(a) of the Foreign Trade Zone Act.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Articles held in bond.</SUBJECT>
                <P>If the dealer is a manufacturer or an export warehouse proprietor and holds articles in TTB bond on April 1, 2009, the floor stocks tax does not apply to those articles. Likewise, if the dealer holds articles in a customs bonded warehouse on which tax has not been paid or determined, the floor stocks tax does not apply on those articles. However, if the dealer on April 1, 2009, holds articles in a customs bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone on which tax has been paid or determined pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 5703(b)(2)(B), the floor stocks tax applies to those articles.</P>

                <P>Articles that the dealer holds for return to a supplier because of some defect are not subject to the floor stocks tax. However, the dealer must segregate any such unmerchantable articles and include them in a separate section of the inventory record. The dealer cannot include as unmerchantable any items that may be held because of poor market demand or to reduce the dealer's inventory. If, for any reason, the tobacco products or cigarette papers or tubes that were determined to be unmerchantable are not subsequently returned or destroyed, the dealer must file an additional floor stocks tax return and pay tax on such products plus any applicable penalties and interest.</P>

              <P>The regulations in this part (part 53, subchapter C, chapter I, title 27, Code of Federal Regulations) are designated “Manufacturers Excise Taxes—Firearms and Ammunition.” The regulations relate to the tax on the sale of firearms and ammunition imposed by section 4181 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to certain related administrative provisions of chapter 32, subchapter F, of the Code. Chapter 32, subchapter D of the Code imposes taxes on the sale or use by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of certain recreational equipment specified in that chapter. References in the regulations in this part to the “Internal Revenue Code” or the “Code” are references to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (United States Code of 1986), as amended, unless otherwise indicated. References to a section or other provision of law are references to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, unless otherwise indicated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Attachment of tax.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For purposes of this part, the manufacturers excise tax generally attaches when the title to the article sold passes from the manufacturer to a purchaser.</P>
              <P>(b) When title passes is dependent upon the intention of the parties as gathered from the contract of sale and the attendant circumstances. In the absence of expressed intention, the legal rules of presumption followed in the jurisdiction where the sale is made govern in determining when title passes.</P>
              <P>(c) In the case of a sale on credit, the tax attaches whether or not the purchase price is actually collected.</P>
              <P>(d) Where a consignor (such as a manufacturer) consigns articles to a consignee (such as a dealer), retaining ownership in them until they are disposed of by the consignee, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach until sale by the consignee. Where the relationship between a manufacturer and a dealer is that of principal and agent, title does not pass, and the tax does not attach, until sale by the dealer.</P>
              <P>(e) In the case of a lease, an installment sale, a conditional sale, or a chattel mortgage arrangement or similar arrangement creating a security interest, a proportionate part of the tax attaches to each payment. See section 4217 and §§ 53.103 and 53.104 for a limitation on the amount of tax payable on lease payments.</P>
              <P>(f) In the case of use by the manufacturer, the tax attaches at the time the use begins.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemption certificates.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Several provisions of this part, relating to sales exempt from manufacturers excise tax, require the manufacturer to obtain an exemption certificate from the purchaser to substantiate the exempt character of the sale. Any form of exemption certificate will be acceptable if it includes all the information required by the provisions of this part. These certificates are available as preprinted documents, which may be ordered by mailing a request to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, National Revenue Center, 550 Main Street, Room 1516, Cincinnati, OH 45202. The preprinted certificates may be reproduced as needed.</P>

If the nominal importer of a taxable article is not its beneficial owner (for example, the nominal importer is a customs broker engaged by the beneficial owner), the beneficial owner is the “importer” of the article for purposes of chapter 32 of the Code and is liable for tax on his sale or use of the article in the United States.

Whether the person who buys such component parts or accessories and assembles a taxable article from them will be liable for tax as a manufacturer of a taxable article will depend on the relative amount of labor, material, and overhead required to assemble the completed article and on whether the article is assembled for business or personal use.</P>

                <E T="03">Revolvers.</E> Small projectile firearms of the pistol type, having a breech-loading chambered cylinder so arranged that the cocking of the hammer or movement of the trigger rotates it and brings the next cartridge in line with the barrel for firing.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sale.</E> An agreement whereby the seller transfers the property (that is, the title or the substantial incidents of ownership in goods) to the buyer for a consideration called the price, which may consist of money, services, or other things.</P>

A person who reloads used shell or cartridge casings is a manufacturer of shells or cartridges within the meaning of section 4181 if such reloaded shells or cartridges are sold by the reloader. However, the reloader is not a manufacturer of shells or cartridges if, in return for a fee and expenses, he reloads casings of shells or cartridges submitted by a customer and returns the reloaded shells or cartridges with the identical casings provided by the customer to that customer. Under such circumstances, the customer would be the manufacturer of the shells or cartridges and may be liable for tax on the sale of articles. See section 4218 of the Code and § 53.112.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Imposition of tax.</E> Section 4181 of the Code imposes a tax on the sale of the following articles by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof:</P>
              <P>(1) Pistols;</P>
              <P>(2) Revolvers;</P>
              <P>(3) Firearms (other than pistols and revolvers); and</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Parts or accessories</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> No tax is imposed by section 4181 of the Code on the sale of parts or accessories of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges when sold separately or when sold with a complete firearm for use as spare parts or accessories. The tax does attach, however, to sales of completed firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, and cartridges, and to sale of such articles that, although in knockdown condition, are complete as to all component parts.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Component parts.</E> Component parts are items that would ordinarily be attached to a firearm during use and, in the ordinary course of trade, are packaged with the firearm at the time of sale by the manufacturer or importer. All component parts for firearms are includible in the price for which the article is sold.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Nontaxable parts.</E> Parts sold with firearms that duplicate component parts that are not includible in the price for which the article is sold.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Nontaxable accessories.</E> Items that are not designed to be attached to a firearm during use or that are not, in the ordinary course of trade, provided with the firearm at the time of the sale by the manufacturer or importer are not includible in the price for which the article is sold.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Examples</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The following examples are provided as guidelines and are not meant to be all inclusive.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Component parts.</E> Component parts include items such as a frame or receiver, breech mechanism, trigger mechanism, barrel, buttstock, forestock, handguard, grips, buttplate, fore end cap, trigger guard, sight or set of sights (iron or optical), sight mount or set of sight mounts, a choke, a flash hider, a muzzle brake, a magazine, a <PRTPAGE P="192"/>set of sling swivels, and/or an attachable ramrod for muzzle loading firearms when provided by the manufacturer or importer for use with the firearm in the ordinary course of commercial trade. Component parts also include any part provided with the firearm that would affect the tax status of the firearm, such as an attachable shoulder stock.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Nontaxable parts.</E> Nontaxable parts include items such as extra barrels, extra sights, optical sights and mounts (in addition to iron sights), spare magazines, spare cylinders, extra choke tubes, and spare pins.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Nontaxable accessories.</E> Nontaxable accessories include items such as cleaning equipment, slings, slip on recoil pads (in addition to standard buttplate), tools, gun cases for storage or transportation, separate items such as knives, belt buckles, or medallions. Nontaxable accessories also include optional items purchased by the customer at the time of retail sale that do not change the tax classification of the firearm, such as telescopic sights and mounts, recoil pads, slings, sling swivels, chokes, and flash hiders/muzzle brakes of a type not provided by the manufacturer or importer of the firearm in the ordinary course of commercial trade.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Rates of tax.</E> Tax is imposed on the sale of the articles specified in section 4181 of the Code at the rates indicated below.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exemptions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Firearms subject to the National Firearms Act.</E> Section 4182(a) provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of any firearms on which the tax imposed by section 5811 of the Code (relating to tax on the transfer of machine guns, short-barreled firearms, and other weapons) has been paid. Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming such an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales to Defense Department or to U.S. Coast Guard</E>—(1) <E T="03">Military department.</E> Section 4182(b) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to the sale of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges that are purchased with funds appropriated for a military department of the United States. For this purpose, the term “military department” means the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force. Included in the Department of the Navy are naval aviation and the Marine Corps.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Coast Guard.</E> Section 655, title 14, U.S.C., provides that no tax on the sale or transfer of firearms, pistols, revolvers, shells, or cartridges may be imposed on such articles when bought with funds appropriated for the United States Coast Guard.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Supporting evidence.</E> Any manufacturer, producer, or importer claiming an exemption from the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code by reason of section 4182(b) and section 655, title 14 of the Code must maintain such records and be prepared to produce such evidence as will establish the right to the exemption. Generally, clearly identified orders or contracts of a military department signed by an authorized officer of the military department will be sufficient to establish the right to the exemption. In the absence of such orders or contracts, a statement, signed by an authorized officer of a military department or the Coast Guard, that the prescribed articles were purchased with funds appropriated for that military department or <PRTPAGE P="193"/>the Coast Guard will constitute satisfactory evidence of the right to an exemption.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Small manufacturers, producers, and importers</E>—(1) <E T="03">Exemption.</E> Section 4182(c) of the Code provides that the tax imposed by section 4181 of the Code shall not attach to any pistol, revolver, or firearm manufactured, produced, or imported by a person who manufactures, produces, and imports less than an aggregate of 50 of those articles during the calendar year, regardless of when the articles are sold.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Controlled groups.</E> All persons treated as a single employer for purposes of subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Code are treated as one person for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> The exemption described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies to articles sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer after September 30, 2005. Application of this exemption is based on the calendar year in which the manufacture, production, or importation of the articles in question took place and does not depend on when the sale occurs. In addition, each calendar year stands alone for purposes of applying the exemption.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Charges to be included in sale price.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The “price” for which an article is sold includes the total consideration paid for the article, whether that consideration is in the form of money, services, or other things. However, for purposes of the taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code, certain collateral charges made in connection with the sale of a taxable article must be included in the taxable sale price, whereas others may be excluded. Any charge which is required by a manufacturer, producer, or importer to be paid as a condition of its sale of a taxable article and which is not attributable to an expense falling within one of the exclusions provided in section 4216 of the Code or the regulations thereunder is includable in the taxable sale price. It is immaterial for this purpose that the charge may be paid to a person other than the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or that it may be separately billed to the purchaser as a charge earmarked for expenses incurred or to be incurred in his behalf, such as charges for demonstration or display of the article, for sales promotion programs, or otherwise. With respect to the rules relating to exclusion of charges for local advertising of a manufacturer's products, see section 4216(e) of the Code and § 53.100. In the case of sales on credit, a carrying, finance, or service charge is excludable from the sale price if it is reasonably related to the costs of carrying the deferred portion of the sale price (such as interest on the deferred portion of the sale price, expenses of bookkeeping necessary to keep the records of such sales, and expenses of correspondence and other communication in connection with collection).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Tools and dies.</E> Separate charges for tools and dies used in the manufacture or production of a taxable article are to be included, in whole or in part, in the sale price on which the tax is based. It is immaterial whether the charges for such items are billed in a lump sum or are amortized or allocated to each of the taxable articles. If, at the termination of a contract to manufacture taxable articles, the tools and dies used in production pass to the purchaser, only the amount of depreciation of the tools and dies incurred in production, computed on a “production output” basis, should be included in <PRTPAGE P="194"/>the sale price. If the purchaser furnishes the tools and dies, the amount of the cost thereof, to the extent that such cost has been depreciated in the production of the taxable articles (computed on a “production output” basis), shall be included in determining the sale price of the articles for purposes of computing the tax.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Charges for warranty.</E> A charge for a warranty of an article which the manufacturer, producer, or importer requires the purchaser to pay in order to obtain the article shall be included in the sale price of the article on which the tax is computed. On the other hand, a charge for a warranty of a taxable article paid at the purchaser's option shall not be included in the sale price for purposes of computing tax thereon.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Charges for coverings, containers, and packing.</E> Any charge by the manufacturer, producer, or importer for coverings and containers of whatever nature used to pack an article for shipment shall be included as part of the sale price for the purpose of computing the tax, whether or not the charges are identified as such on the invoice or are billed separately. Even though there is an agreement that the manufacturer, producer, or importer will repay all or a portion of the charge for the coverings or containers upon the return thereof, the full charge nevertheless shall be included in the sale price. It is immaterial whether the charge made at the time of sale is more or less than the actual value of the covering or container. See § 53.173(b)(4) for provisions relating to the claiming of a credit or refund in the case of a price readjustment due to the return or repossession of a covering or container. Packing charges are to be included in the sale price whether the charges cover normal packing or special packing services, such as for extra protection of the article or for odd-lot quantities. This rule shall apply whether the packing services are initiated by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or are furnished at the request of the purchaser and whether the packing is performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer or by another person at his request. If the purchaser supplies packing materials, the fair market value of such materials must be included in the tax base when computing tax liability on the sale of the article.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Taxable and nontaxable articles sold as a unit.</E> Where a taxable article and a nontaxable article are sold by the manufacturer as a unit, the tax attaches to that portion of the manufacturer's sale price of the unit which is properly allocable to the taxable article. Normally, the taxable portion of such a unit may be determined by applying to the manufacturer's sale price of the unit the ratio which the manufacturer's separate sale price of the taxable article bears to the sum of the sale prices of both the taxable and nontaxable articles, if such articles are sold separately by the manufacturer. Where the articles (or either one of them) are not sold separately by the manufacturer and do not have established sale prices, the taxable portion is to be determined from a comparison of the actual costs of the articles to the manufacturer. Thus, if the cost of the taxable article represents four-fifths of the total cost of the complete unit, the tax applies to four-fifths of the price charged by the manufacturer for the unit.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exclusions from sale price.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tax not part of taxable sale price.</E> The tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of an article is not part of the taxable sale price of the article. Thus, if a manufacturer computes the tax on a sale price which is determined without regard to the tax, and it charges the proper tax as a separate item, the amount of tax so charged does not become a part of the taxable sale price and no tax is due on the tax so charged. Where no separate charge is made as tax, it will be presumed that the price charged to the purchaser for the article includes the proper tax, and the proper percentage of such price will be allocated to the tax.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Computation of tax.</E> If an article subject to tax at the rate of 10 percent is sold for $100 and an additional item of $10 is billed as tax, $100 is the taxable selling price and $10 is the amount <PRTPAGE P="195"/>of tax due thereon. However, if the article is sold for $100 with no separate billing or indication of the amount of the tax, it will be presumed that the tax is included in the $100, and a computation will be necessary to determine what portion of the total amount represents the sale price of the article and what portion represents the tax. The computation is as follows:</P>
              <MATH DEEP="30" SPAN="2">
                <MID>ER25SE06.035</MID>
              </MATH>
              <FP>Thus, if the tax rate is 10 percent and the sale price including tax is $100, the taxable sale price is $90.91 (that is, $100 divided by (100+10)), and the tax is 10 percent of $90.91, or $9.09.</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Transportation, delivery, insurance, or installation charges</E>—(1) <E T="03">Charges incurred pursuant to sale.</E> Charges for transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and other expenses actually incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale shall be excluded from the sale price in computing the tax. Such charges include all items of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation, and similar expense incurred after shipment to a customer begins, in response to the customer's order, pursuant to a bona fide sale. However, costs of such nature incurred by a manufacturer, producer, or importer in transporting, in the normal course of business and for its benefit and convenience, articles from a factory or port of entry to a warehouse or other facility (regardless of the location of such warehouse or facility) are not considered as being incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, and charges therefor cannot be excluded from the sale price in computing tax liability. Similarly, an allowance granted by a manufacturer as reimbursement for expenses incurred by the purchaser in shipping used articles to the manufacturer for credit against the purchase price of taxable articles shall not be excluded from the sale price when computing tax due on the sale of the taxable articles. In any event, no charge may be excluded from the sale price unless the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are complied with. Said conditions are prescribed under the authority granted the Secretary in section 4216(a) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Only actual expenses to be excluded.</E> Where a separate charge is made for transportation or other expenses incurred in connection with the delivery of an article to the purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale, there shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price subject to tax only that portion of the charge which represents the actual expenses incurred for the transportation or other excludable expenses. Where a separate charge is less than the actual expense, the difference is presumed to be included in the billed price. Such difference, together with the separate charge, shall be excluded in arriving at the sale price on which the tax is computed. Similarly, where no separate charge is made but the manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs an expense of the type to which this paragraph has application, the amount of such expense actually incurred shall be excluded from the sale price on which the tax is computed. Where transportation expense is incurred in conjunction with a shipment composed of both taxable and nontaxable articles, only the portion of the expense allocable to the taxable articles shall be excludable. In general, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that another method reasonably apportions such freight expense between taxable and nontaxable articles, such expense should be apportioned on the basis of the relative weights (or, if available, the relative published tariff rates) applicable to the taxable and nontaxable articles. Where it is not feasible to apportion such expense on the basis of <PRTPAGE P="196"/>relative weights or tariff rates, the expense shall be apportioned on another reasonable basis; for example, in the case of a shipment including both taxable and nontaxable articles which are subject to the same tariff rate, it may be appropriate to apportion the transportation expense on the basis of the relative sale prices. A charge for insurance in connection with the delivery of an article to a purchaser is considered to represent an expense actually incurred only to the extent that an amount equivalent to such charge is paid or payable by the manufacturer to a person authorized to assume such insurance risk.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Transportation, delivery, or installation services performed by manufacturer.</E> For purposes of computing the taxable sale price of articles, it is immaterial whether the transportation, delivery, or other services of the type to which this paragraph has application are performed by a common carrier or independent agency for or on behalf of the manufacturer, producer, or importer, or are performed by the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the use of its own vehicles or other facilities. Thus, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer performs the transportation, delivery, or other services with its equipment, tools, employees, etc., the cost of such services allocable to the sale of the taxable article shall be excluded. In determining whether an expense is an excludable transportation or delivery expense, only those expenses incurred by reason of the fact that the purchaser accepts delivery at some point other than the manufacturer's place of business shall be considered excludable transportation or delivery expenses. All expenses incurred in placing an article packed, ready for shipment on the loading dock at the manufacturer's factory are not excludable transportation or delivery expenses. An allowance granted by the manufacturer, producer, or importer to the purchaser for transportation, delivery, or other expenses incurred or to be incurred by the purchaser in connection with the sale shall be excluded in computing the taxable sale price, if charges for similar expenses would be excludable if incurred by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Records in support of exclusion.</E> Every manufacturer, producer, or importer making sales of taxable articles shall keep records which will disclose the amount of transportation, delivery, insurance, installation or other expense actually incurred by it in connection with the delivery of a taxable article to a purchaser pursuant to a bona fide sale.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Other charges.</E> A charge or expense not within the scope of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, whether or not separately stated, may not be excluded in computing the taxable sale price unless it can be shown by adequate records that the charge or expense is not properly included as a manufacturing or selling expense or is in no way incidental to placing the article in condition packed ready for shipment. Commissions to manufacturers' agents, or allowances, payments, or adjustments made to, and for the benefit of, persons other than the purchaser may not be excluded or deducted, under any condition, in computing the sale price upon which the tax is computed.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Other items relating to tax on sale price.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Exchanges.</E> If, in connection with the sale of an article subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, a manufacturer receives from its vendee another article in exchange, the tax on the manufacturer's sale shall be computed on the basis of the amount allowed for the article received from the vendee, plus any additional amount charged the vendee.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Replacements under warranty.</E> If an article, subject to a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which sold, is returned to the manufacturer by reason of the failure of the article under a warranty as to its quality or service, and a new article is given by the manufacturer, free, or at a reduced price, the tax on the new article shall be computed on the actual amount, if any, to be paid to the manufacturer for the new article. See § 53.174(b) for the circumstances under which the allowance made by the manufacturer, producer, or importer upon the return of the first article constitutes a price readjustment of the sale price of the first <PRTPAGE P="197"/>article and the extent, if any, to which a credit may be allowed, or refund made, of the tax paid by the manufacturer, producer, or importer on the sale of the first article.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Readjustments in sale price.</E> Readjustment in sale price (such as allowable discounts, rebates, bonuses, etc.) cannot be anticipated. The tax must be based upon the original price unless the readjustments have actually been made prior to the close of the period for which the tax upon the sale is returned. However, if the price upon which the tax was computed is subsequently readjusted, credit may be taken against the tax due on a subsequent return or a claim for refund filed as provided by section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and §§ 53.174-53.176.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(b) of the Code pertains to those taxes imposed under chapter 32 of the Code that are based on the price for which an article is sold, and contains the provisions for constructing a tax base other than the actual sale price of the article, under certain defined conditions.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific applications.</E> (1) Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code applies to:</P>
              <P>(i) Arm's-length sales at retail or on consignment, other than those sales at retail and to retailers to which section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Sales otherwise than at arm's length, and at less than fair market price.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code applies generally to arm's-length sales of an article at retail or to retailers, or both, where the manufacturer also sells the same article to wholesale distributors.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a formula for determining a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between members of an affiliated group of corporations (as “affiliated group” is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code) in those instances where the purchasing corporation regularly resells to retailers but does not regularly resell to wholesale distributors, and except for situations where section 4216(b)(4) of the Code applies.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a special method for computing a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles between affiliated corporations where the purchasing corporation sells only to retailers, and the normal method of selling within the industry is for manufacturers to sell to wholesale distributors.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94-53.97 and unless otherwise indicated:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sale at retail.</E> A “sale at retail,” or a “retail sale”, is a sale of an article to a purchaser who intends to use or lease the article rather than resell it. The fact that articles are sold in wholesale lots, or at wholesale prices, will not change the character of such sales as “sales at retail” if the purchaser is not engaged in the business of reselling such articles, and acquires them for the purpose of using them rather than reselling them.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Retail dealers.</E> A “retail dealer”, or “retailer”, is a person engaged in the business of selling articles at retail.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Wholesale distributor.</E> The term “wholesale distributor” means a person engaged in the business of selling articles to persons engaged in the business of reselling such articles.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Constructive sale price; basic rules.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(b)(1) of the Code sets forth the conditions that require the Secretary to construct a sale price on which to compute a tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code on the price for which an article is sold. The section requires a constructive sale price to be established where a taxable article is:</P>
              <P>(1) Sold at retail;</P>
              <P>(2) Sold while on consignment; or,</P>
              <P>(3) Sold otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction at less than fair market price.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales at retail.</E> Section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code relates to the determination of a constructive sale price for sales of taxable articles sold at arm's-length and at retail. In the case of such sales, the constructive sale price is the highest price for which such articles <PRTPAGE P="198"/>are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. If the constructive sale price is less than the actual sale price, the constructive sale price shall be used as the tax base. If the constructive sale price is not less than the actual sale price, the actual sale price shall be considered as not less than fair market, and shall be used as the tax base. In determining the highest price for which articles are sold by manufacturers to wholesale distributors, there must be taken into consideration the normal industry practices with respect to inclusions and exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined by the Secretary, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply in those instances where the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales on consignment.</E> As in the case of sales at retail, the constructive sale price for sales on consignment shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course for trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph, an article is considered to be sold on consignment if it is sold while it is on consignment to a person which has the right to sell, and does sell, such article in its own name, but never receives title to the article from the manufacturer. Ordinarily, the constructive sale price of an article sold on consignment is the net price received by the manufacturer from the consignee. The provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(B) of the Code and this paragraph shall not apply if the provisions of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and § 53.96 apply.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Sales not at arm's-length.</E> For purposes of section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code and this paragraph, a sale is considered to be made under circumstances otherwise than at “arm's-length” if:</P>
              <P>(1) One of the parties is controlled (in law or in fact) by the other, or there is common control, whether or not such control is actually exercised to influence the sale price, or</P>
              <P>(2) The sale is made pursuant to special arrangements between a manufacturer and a purchaser.</P>
              <FP>In case of an article sold otherwise than at arm's-length, and at less than fair market price, the constructive sale price shall be the price for which such articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers or producers thereof, as determined by the Secretary. Once such a constructive sale price has been determined, no further adjustment of such price shall be made. See sections 4216(b) (3) and (4) of the Code, and § 53.97, for specific methods for determining constructive sale prices for intercompany sales under certain defined conditions.</FP>

              <SUBJECT>Constructive sale price; special rule for arm's-length sales.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(b)(2) of the Code provides a special rule under which a manufacturer shall determine a constructive sale price for this sale of taxable articles at retail, and to retail dealers, under certain conditions. The rule is applicable where:</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer regularly sells such articles at retail, or to retailers, or both, as the case may be,</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer also regularly sells such articles to one or more wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions, and the manufacturer establishes that its prices in such cases are determined without regard to any benefit to be derived under section 4216(b)(2) of the Code, and</P>
              <P>(3) The transactions are arm's-length transactions.</P>
              <P>(4) A manufacturer meeting the foregoing requirements shall base its tax liability for sales at retail and sales to retailers on the lower of its actual sale price or the highest price for which it sells the same articles under the same conditions to wholesale distributors.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of section 4216(b)(2) of the Code and this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Actual sale price.</E> “Actual sale price” means the actual selling price for an article determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale. Accordingly, such price <PRTPAGE P="199"/>must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code, and any price adjustments described in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Highest price to wholesale distributors.</E> The “highest price” charged wholesale distributors for an article by a manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, is the highest price at which the manufacturer, producer, or importer sells the article to wholesale distributors, determined without regard to quantity. Such price shall be determined in the same manner as sale price is determined for a taxable sale with respect to the inclusions and exclusions under sections 4216(a) and (e) of the Code; however, since the price is to be a “highest” price, no further adjustment may be made for price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Regular sales.</E> An article is considered to be sold “regularly” at retail or to retailers if sales are made at retail or to retailers periodically and recurringly as a regular part of the seller's business. If a seller makes only isolated or casual sales of an article at retail or to retailers, it is not considered to be selling “regularly” at retail or to retailers. Similarly, a manufacturer is considered to be making regular sales of an article to one or more distributors if it sells the article to at least one distributor periodically and recurringly as a regular part of its business.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Normal method of sales in industry.</E> In the absence of a showing to the appropriate TTB officer of a more appropriate manner of determining the normal method of sales within an industry which is practical in application, the normal method of sales within an industry shall be regarded as not being at retail or to retailers, or both, if the industry dollar volume of sales which are at retail or to retailers, or both, is less than half the total industry dollar volume of sales at all levels of distribution by manufacturers, producers, or importers, including sales to other manufacturers, producers, or importers.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Sections 4216(b) (3) and (4) of the Code establish procedures for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code for sales between corporations that are members of the same “affiliated group”, as that term is defined in section 1504(a) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales to which section 4216(b)(3) of the Code applies.</E> Section 4216(b)(3) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instances where:</P>
              <P>(1) A manufacturer, producer or importer regularly sells a taxable article to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producers or importer, and</P>
              <P>(2) The wholesale distributor regularly sells such article to one or more independent retailers, but does not regularly sell to wholesale distributors. Under such circumstances the constructive sale price for the article shall be an amount equal to 90 percent of the lowest price for which the distributor regularly sells the article in arm's-length transactions to such independent retailers. Once the constructive sale price has been determined, no adjustment shall be made for inclusions or exclusions under section 4216(a) of the Code or price readjustments under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code. If both sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4) of the Code apply with respect to the sale of an article, the constructive sale price for such article shall be the lower of the prices computed under sections 4216(b)(3) and 4216(b)(4).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales to which section 4216(b)(4) of the Code applies.</E> Section 4216(b)(4) of the Code provides a procedure for determining a constructive sale price under section 4216(b)(1)(C) of the Code in those instance where:</P>

              <P>(1) A manufacturer, producer, or importer regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) a taxable article only to a wholesale distributor which is a member of the same affiliated group as the manufacturer, producer, or importer,<PRTPAGE P="200"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) The distributor regularly sells (except for tax-free sales) such article only to retail dealers, and</P>
              <P>(3) The normal method of sales for such articles within the industry is to sell such articles in arm's-length transactions to wholesale distributors.</P>
              <P>(4) Under section 4216(b)(4) of the Code, the constructive sale price of such article shall be the median price at which the distributor, at the time of the sale by the manufacturer, resells the article to retail dealers, reduced by a percentage of such price equal to the percentage which:</P>
              <P>(i) The difference between the median price for which comparable articles are sold to wholesale distributors, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers of producers thereof, and the median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers, is of</P>
              <P>(ii) The median price at which such wholesale distributors in arm's-length transactions sell such comparable articles to retailers.</P>
              <P>(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the “median price” for which an article is sold at a particular level of distribution is the price midway between the highest and lowest prices charged vendees at the particular level of distribution. Where only one price is charged at a level of distribution, “median price” is equivalent to “actual price”. All sale prices referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are prices that must reflect the inclusions and exclusions set forth in section 4216(a) of the Code. However, once a constructive sale price has been determined under these paragraphs, no further adjustment of such price is allowed.</P>

                <P>M, a corporation engaged in the manufacture of article X, sold 100 of such articles at $10.00 per article to a wholesale distributor N, a corporation engaged in the business of selling X articles to independent retail dealers. N is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations as M. M sells X articles only to N. The normal method of manufacturers' sales of X articles in the industry is to sell to independent wholesale distributors. N corporation sells X articles to retailers for $15.00 each. The price for which comparable X articles are sold to wholesale distributors in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers thereof is $12.00 per article. Wholesale distributors sell X articles to retailers in the ordinary course of trade for $16.00 per article. Under the foregoing facts the constructive sale price determined under section 4216(b)(4) of the Code and this paragraph is $11.25, computed as follows:</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Determination of “lowest price”.</E> In addition to other considerations, in determining a “lowest price” for purposes of sections 4216(b) (1) and (3) of the Code and § 53.97, such price shall be determined:</P>
              <P>(1) Without requiring that a given percentage of sales be made at that price (provided that the volume of sales made at that price is great enough to indicate that those sales have not been engaged in primarily to establish a lower tax base), and</P>
              <P>(2) Without including any charge for a fixed amount that the purchaser has an unconditional right to recover on the basis of a contractual arrangement existing at the time of sale.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Computation of tax on leases and installment sales.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Leases.</E> When a taxable article is leased by a manufacturer, producer, or importer, liability for tax is incurred, except as provided by section 4217(b) of the Code and § 53.104, on each payment made with respect to such lease. Tax is payable on each lease payment as long as the article is leased by the manufacturer, producer, or importer. The tax payable with respect to each lease payment is a percentage of each payment <PRTPAGE P="201"/>based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the lease payment is due. If the article is subsequently sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, the tax applies also to such sale, without regard to the tax paid when the article was leased. For definition of the term “lease”, see § 53.103.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Installment sales.</E> When a taxable article is sold under an installment payment contract with title reserved in the seller, or under a conditional sale contract, chattel mortgage arrangement or other arrangement creating a security interest with payments to be made in installments, tax shall be computed and paid on each payment made by the purchaser. The tax payable with each payment is a percentage of each payment based on the rate of tax, if any, in effect on the date the payment is due. The part of each payment that is subject to tax is that portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total portion of the payment equal to the percentage of the total charge for the article that is subject to tax. For example, if the total charge for the article is $1,000, and of the total amount charged only 90 percent thereof, or $900, is subject to tax by reason of exclusions, then only 90 percent of the installment payment is subject to tax. If the tax base is a constructive sale price computed under section 4216(b) of the Code that is less than the actual sale price of the article, the portion of each payment subject to tax is the percentage of such payment equal to the percentage that the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price. For example, if an article is sold at retail for $100, and the constructive sale price for such an article computed under the provisions of section 4216(b)(1)(A) of the Code is $75, the percentage which the constructive sale price bears to the actual sale price is 75 percent. Accordingly, only 75 percent of each installment payment is subject to tax.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Sales on credit.</E> Where articles are sold on credit under conditions other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the entire tax shall be reported and paid with the return covering the period in which the sale is made, even though the price may not be paid to the manufacturer, producer, or importer until a later date, or not paid at all.</P>

Instead, there shall be paid an amount equal to the difference between the tax previously paid on such installment account and the total tax computed by applying:</P>
              <P>(1) To each installment due before the sale of the installment account, the rate of tax applicable at the time payment thereof was due, and</P>
              <P>(2) To each installment, the time for payment of which has not arrived, the rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such installment is due. However, see paragraph (b) of this section if the sale is made in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding. The tax due under this paragraph shall be included in the return for the period in which the account is sold.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sale in bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding.</E> In the case of a sale of an installment account of a manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to the order of, or subject to the approval of, a court of competent jurisdiction in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, the amount of tax due shall be computed and paid as provided in paragraph (a) of this section but shall not exceed the amount of tax computed by multiplying:</P>
              <P>(1) The proportionate share of the amount for which such accounts are sold which is allocable to each unpaid installment payment, by</P>
              <P>(2) The rate of tax which, under the provisions of chapter 32 of the Code as in effect on the date of the sale of the installment account, is (or is to be) in effect on the date such payment is due.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Collection of installment accounts on behalf of the manufacturer.</E> Where a manufacturer, producer, or importer retains title to an installment account <PRTPAGE P="202"/>but turns it over to another person for collection on a fee basis, no sale of such account (or other disposition as contemplated in section 4216(d) of the Code) has been made. The tax shall continue to be paid as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Returned installment accounts.</E> Where an installment account which has been sold or otherwise disposed of is returned to the manufacturer, producer, or importer who sold it under an agreement under which the account was sold, and credit or refund has been allowed under section 6416(b)(5) of the Code and § 53.183, the manufacturer, producer, or importer shall pay tax as provided by section 4216(c) of the Code and § 53.98 on any subsequent payments made on such returned installment account until such time as there shall have been paid the total tax liability with respect to the account as computed under paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The sum of the amounts payable under this section and § 53.98 or an installment account shall not exceed the total amount of tax which would be payable if such installment account had not been sold or otherwise disposed of (computed as provided in subsection (c)).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4216(e) of the Code deals with the treatment to be accorded charges made by a manufacturer for, and reimbursements by a manufacturer or expenditures in connection with the advertising of certain articles subject to excise tax under chapter 32 of the Code. Section 4216(e) of the Code provides an exclusion (which is in addition to the exclusions provided by section 4216(a) of the Code and § 53.92) in respect of charges for local advertising, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of determining the price for which an article is sold. See paragraph (c) of this section. The exclusion provided by section 4216(e) of the Code and paragraph (c) of this section has application only if the advertising is broadcast over a radio or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster. Section 4216(e) of the Code also provides an overall limitation in respect of the sum of the amount of the exclusions from price as charges for local advertising and the amount of the readjustments authorized under section 6416(b)(1) of the Code (relating to credits or refunds for price readjustments) in respect of reimbursements by a manufacturer of expenditures for local advertising. See § 53.101. For provisions prohibiting exclusion from price or readjustment of price in respect of charges for, and reimbursements of expenditures for, advertising other than local advertising, see § 53.102.</P>

              <P>(i) Is initiated or obtained by the purchaser or any subsequent vendee,</P>
              <P>(ii) Names the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 and states the location at which such article may be purchased at retail, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Is broadcast over a radio station or television station, appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Initiating or obtaining advertising.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must be initiated or obtained by one or more of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article (wholesale distributor, jobber, dealer, etc.) who purchased the article for resale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the manufacturer is not considered to be one of the persons in the chain of distribution of the article. In general, advertising of an article is considered to be initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article if any such person:</P>

              <P>(i) Takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, or<PRTPAGE P="203"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Contracts for the placement of the advertising.</P>
              <FP>The participation by the manufacturer of the article in the planning, development, or placement of the advertising is immaterial provided the advertising is in fact initiated or obtained by one or more persons in the chain of distribution of the article. Furthermore, it is immaterial whether or not the advertising is subject to the approval of the manufacturer of the article. However, if no person in the chain of distribution of the article takes an active part in the actual planning and development, or in the arrangements or negotiations leading to the development, of the form and content of the advertising, but, rather, all such planning, development, arrangements, and negotiations are accomplished by the manufacturer of the article, then such manufacturer is considered to have initiated the advertising, and if he also contracts for the placement of the advertising, such advertising does not qualify as “local advertising”.</FP>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Identification of article and sales location.</E> To meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the advertising must identify the article for which the price is determinable under section 4216 of the Code and give the location or locations at which the article may be purchased at retail. All products taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code shall be considered to be an “article” for purposes of the preceding sentence. No specific method or means of identification is prescribed. The identification of the article may be made through the use of the name of the manufacturer or the use of an established trade-mark, such as a seal, picture, letter or letters, etc., or a combination thereof. The advertising must identify the particular retail establishment or establishments at which the article may be purchased at retail but need not specify the location of any such establishment in terms of the number by which the premises are designated or the name of the street on which the retail premises are situated. However, the location of the retail premises must be described sufficiently, as, for example, by reference to a particular named shopping area or shopping center, to enable customers to find the retail establishment.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Determination of costs of local advertising.</E> Where an advertisement identifies more than one article, and all such articles are not taxable, or are not taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, a reasonable allocation of the cost of the advertisement must be made among:</P>
              <P>(i) Articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Articles which are not taxable under chapter 32 of the Code.</P>
              <FP>For example, in the case of a single page newspaper or magazine advertisement, an allocation of costs reflecting the lineage or space devoted to the specified categories will be considered to reflect a reasonable allocation of the cost of advertising the different articles. As a general rule, only the cost of the “spot” portion identifying the retail establishment is considered “local advertising” in the case of national television or radio programs.</FP>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Meaning of “newspaper”.</E> The term <E T="03">newspaper,</E> as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are commonly understood to be newspapers and which are printed and distributed periodically at daily, weekly, or other short intervals for the dissemination of news of a general character and of a general interest. The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers, or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. Neither does the term include any publication which is issued to supply information on certain subjects of interest to particular groups unless such publication otherwise qualifies as a newspaper within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be news of a general character and of a general interest.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Meaning of “magazine”.</E> The term <E T="03">magazine,</E> as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is limited to those publications which are:</P>
              <P>(i) Commonly understood to be magazines,<PRTPAGE P="204"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Printed and distributed periodically at least twice a year, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Published for the dissemination of information of a general nature or of special interest to particular groups.</P>
              <P>(iv) The term does not include handbills, circulars, flyers or the like, unless printed and distributed as a part of a publication which constitutes a magazine within the meaning of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, advertising is not considered to be information of a general nature or information of special interest to particular groups within the contemplation of paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Meaning of “outdoor advertising sign or poster”.</E> The term “outdoor advertising sign or poster”, as used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, means a sign or poster displaying advertising matter, which is located outside of a roofed enclosure. This term includes both signs or posters on billboards, whether placed on or affixed to land, buildings, or other structures, and those which are displayed on or attached to moving objects, provided the signs or posters are located outside of a roofed enclosure. The term “roofed enclosure” means a roof structure which is enclosed on more than one-half of its sides by walls, fences, or other barriers.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Exclusion</E>—(1) <E T="03">Conditions and limitations.</E> A charge for local advertising which is required by a manufacturer to be paid as a condition to his sale of an article is not a part of the taxable price of the article, to the extent that such charge meets each of the following conditions and limitations:</P>
              <P>(i) Such charge does not exceed 5 percent of the difference between:</P>
              <P>(A) An amount which would constitute the taxable price of the article (computed at the time of the sale of the article) if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and</P>
              <P>(B) The amount of any separate charge for local advertising, whatever the amount of such charge may be,</P>
              <P>(ii) Such charge is specifically shown as a separate charge for local advertising on the invoice or statement covering the sale of the article.</P>
              <P>(iii) Such charge is billed by the manufacturer with the intention on his part of repaying the amount of the charge to the person purchasing the article from him, or to any person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the fact of such intention will be assumed in all cases where the manufacturer and his vendees are parties to an advertising plan which calls for such repayments, or the manufacturer can otherwise establish that the vendees to whom he bills such charges understand and expect that such repayments will be made.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">When exclusion ceases to apply.</E> To the extent that charges for local advertising meet the conditions and limitations stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, such charge is excludable in computing the taxable price of the article in respect of which the charge was made. However, the exclusion will cease to apply in respect of any part of such charge which the manufacturer fails to repay before May 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the article was sold, to the person who purchased the article from him, or to some other person who subsequently purchases the article for resale, in reimbursement of costs incurred for local advertising of such article or some other article or articles taxable at the same rate under the same section of the Code. If, before such May 1, any part of the charge so excluded has not been so repaid, the manufacturer becomes liable for tax on such May 1 in the same manner as if an article taxable under such section of the Code had been sold by him on such May 1 at a taxable price equivalent to that part of the charge not so repaid. However, see paragraph (b)(2) of § 53.175, relating to price readjustments in cases where local advertising charges are not repaid before such May 1 but are subsequently paid over by the manufacturer to his vendees in reimbursement of costs for local advertising. For provisions relating to the method of determining whether a payment by a manufacturer is or is not attributable to an excluded local advertising <PRTPAGE P="205"/>charge, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 53.101. In any case where the payment is determined to be attributable to such a charge, the date of the sale in connection with which the charge was made shall be determined on a first-in-first-out basis in respect of the vendee to whom the charge was billed by the manufacturer.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 53.101</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Limitation on aggregate of exclusions and price readjustments.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The sum of the amount excluded from taxable price in respect of charges for local advertising, as provided in section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, plus the amount of the readjustments for which credits or refunds may be claimed in respect of local advertising, as provided in section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.175, is subject to an overall 5 percent limitation. This limitation applies to each manufacturer, as of the close of each calendar quarter, in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code which were sold by such manufacturer in such quarter (and the preceding quarter or quarters, if any, in the calendar year).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of overall 5 percent limitation</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The limitation prescribed by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code (the “overall 5 percent limitation” referred to in paragraph (a) of this section) as to the total of the exclusions from price and readjustments of price which may be claimed for local advertising in respect of all articles taxable under the same section of Chapter 32 of the Code shall be computed as of the close of each calendar quarter of the calendar year. The overall 5 percent limitation is 5 percent of the difference between:</P>
              <P>(i) The amount which would constitute the total taxable price (computed at the time of sale) of all articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code sold by the manufacturer during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, if no part of any charge for local advertising were excludable in computing taxable price, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The total of all amounts billed as separate charges for local advertising of such articles (whatever the amount of any single charge of the total of all charges).</P>
              <P>(iii) In making the computations under paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, credits or refunds under section 6416(b) of the Code of tax paid on the sale of any such articles are to be disregarded and articles sold tax-free by the manufacturer are to be excluded. The amount by which the overall 5 percent limitation computed as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code exceeds the sum of the charges for local advertising excluded in computing the taxable price and the amount of reimbursements for local advertising of such articles made during the elapsed calendar quarters of the calendar year, in respect of which credit or refund has been claimed, represents the unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation. Such unused portion is the maximum amount of reimbursements for local advertising in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed at the close of the particular calendar quarter, subject to the applicable conditions and limitations governing the right to claim a credit or refund in respect of local advertising (see § 53.175). The unused portion of the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year in respect of which credit or refund may not be claimed as of the close of such quarter must be disregarded in computing the overall 5 percent limitation for any subsequent calendar quarter. Moreover, the amount of any reimbursements for local advertising made by a manufacturer in a calendar year which is in excess of the amount of such reimbursements in respect of which credit or refund may be claimed, within the overall limitation, as of the close of the calendar year, may not subsequently serve as the basis for a credit or refund.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Alternative method of computation in certain cases.</E> If during the portion of the calendar year ending with the date as of which the overall 5 percent limitation is being computed the amount of the local advertising charge separately <PRTPAGE P="206"/>billed by the manufacturer has not, in respect of any sale of any articles taxable under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, exceeded the amount excludable pursuant to § 53.100 in computing taxable price, the overall 5 percent limitation as of the close of a particular calendar quarter in respect of articles taxable under such section is 5 percent of the total taxable price (computed at the time of the sale) of all such articles sold taxpaid during the calendar year.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Allocation of amounts paid in reimbursement of expenditures for local advertising.</E> If a manufacturer makes contributions to a local advertising program in connection with which he makes excludable local advertising charges, it is necessary that reimbursements by the manufacturer for local advertising be attributed to the charges for local advertising, to the manufacturer's contributions, or allocated between them. Whether an amount paid by a manufacturer in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising is or is not a repayment of a local advertising charge which was excluded from taxable price under section 4216(e)(1) of the Code and § 53.100, shall be determined on the basis of an allocation made under the agreement between the manufacturer and his vendee (or any subsequent vendee).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Examples.</E> The application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

              <SUBJECT>Limitation on amount of tax applicable to certain leases.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Conditions for eligibility.</E> Section 4217(b) of the Code provides for a limitation on the amount of tax that shall apply to the lease, any renewal, or further lease, of an article which, if sold, would be subject to tax on the basis of sale price. Such limitation on the amount of the tax applies with respect to the lease of an article only if, at the time of making the lease, the lessor is engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of article. In case of a lease to which section 4217(b) of the Code does not apply, tax shall be computed and paid as provided in section 4216(c) of the Code and paragraph (a) of § 53.98.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Lessor engaged in business of selling.</E> The lessor will be regarded as being engaged in the business of selling in arm's length transactions the same type and model of an article as the one being leased if it periodically and recurringly makes bona fide offers for sale of such articles in the regular course of operation of its business, which offers if accepted would constitute sales at arm's length. Whether the offers are bona fide shall be determined on the basis of the facts in each case, such as sales actually made, the nature of the advertising, sales literature, and other means used to effectuate sales. It is not necessary that the offers for sale be made to the same class of purchasers as those to whom the article is being leased.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Same type and model of article.</E> To qualify as the “same type and model of article”, the article offered for sale must be an unused article essentially the same in size, design, and function as the article being leased. Slight differences in appearance or accessories will not render articles dissimilar which are identical in all other respects.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Basis for tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">Tax payable until total tax in paid.</E> In case of a lease of an article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, tax shall be paid on each lease payment in an amount computed by applying to such lease payment a percentage equal to the rate of tax in effect on the date of the lease payment. Such tax payments shall continue to be made under such lease, or any subsequent lease of the article, until the cumulative total of the tax payments equals the total tax. Lease payments made thereafter with respect to that article shall not be subject to tax. For definition of the term “total tax,” see paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Changes in tax rates.</E> If the rate of tax is increased or decreased during a lease period, the new rate shall apply to the lease payments made on and after the date of the change, but the amount of the total tax shall remain the same.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Total tax.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “total tax” means the amount of tax, computed at the rate in effect on the date of the first lease of the article to which section 4217(b) of the Code applies, which would be due on the constructive sale price of the article as determined under section 4216(b) of the Code and § 53.95, as if the article had been sold by a manufacturer at retail on such date.<PRTPAGE P="209"/>
              </P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Sale of article before total tax becomes payable.</E> If the lessor sells the article before the total tax has become payable, the tax payable on the sale shall be the lesser of the following amounts:</P>
              <P>(1) The difference between:</P>
              <P>(i) The total tax, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The aggregate tax applicable to lease payments already received; or</P>
              <P>(2) A tax computed, at the rate in effect on the date of the sale, on the price for which the article is sold. For purposes of (f)(2) of this section, the provisions of section 4216(b) of the Code for determining a constructive sale price shall not apply if the sale is at arm's length. If the sale is not at arm's length, the tax referred to in (f)(2) of this section shall be computed on a constructive sale price as provided in § 53.95.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Sale of article after total tax has become payable.</E> If the lessor sells an article after the total tax has become payable, the tax imposed under chapter 32 of the Code shall not apply to such sale.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4218 of the Code imposes tax in respect of certain uses of articles by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof. This section also applies in respect of the use of articles by any other person who, pursuant to a provision of chapter 32 of the Code, is considered to be, or is treated as, the manufacturer or producer of the articles. See, for example, section 4223 of the Code relating to articles purchased tax free for use in further manufacture.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Taxable articles in general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Application of tax.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code uses the article for any purpose other than that indicated in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, he shall be liable for tax with respect to the use of such article in the same manner as if the article were sold by him.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Taxable use in manufacturer of nontaxable articles</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of an article to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies, tax attaches when the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the articles uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article which is not taxable under chapter 32 of the Code, regardless of the disposition made of such other article. (See paragraph (c) of § 53.115 for computation of tax on such use.)</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Types of use in manufacture of nontaxable articles.</E> Taxable use may consist of the incorporation of a taxable article into a nontaxable article. Taxable use may also result from the combining of a taxable article (or the components thereof) with a nontaxable article (or the components of a nontaxable article) resulting in a combination end article which itself is not taxable. Although the taxable article may not be a completely separable unit, within the contemplation of the law a taxable article has been produced and incorporated in the combination end article.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Nontaxable use in manufacturer of taxable articles.</E> The tax on the use of an article to which paragraph (b)(1) of this section has application shall not apply if the article is used by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof as material in the manufacturer or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code to be manfactured or produced by him. It is immaterial what disposition is made of such other article.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Use after lease.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of a taxable article leases such article and thereafter uses the article, he incurs liability for tax on such use as provided in these regulations to the same extent as if the article were sold after being leased. See section 4217 of the Code and the regulations thereunder in this subpart for application and computation of tax in case of leased articles.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Time of application of tax.</E> In the case of a taxable use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, the tax attaches at the time such use begins. If tax applies by reason of the sale of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof on or in connection with his <PRTPAGE P="210"/>sale of another article, the tax attaches at the time of the sale of such other article.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Exemptions because of other statutory provisions.</E> Tax does not apply on the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if under the applicable provisions of the Code the sale of the article for a similar use would not be subject to tax. Also, tax need not be paid with respect to the use of an article by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof if such use would qualify, under the provisions of section 6416(b) of the Code, for credit or refund of the tax paid.</P>

                <P>For purposes of section 4218 and § 53.111, an article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article, if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacturer of another article if it is partly or entirely consumed in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges used in testing new firearms. Similarly, if an article is partly or wholly consumed in quality testing a production run of like articles, such article is also considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of another article. However, if a taxable article that has been used tax free and only partly consumed in testing is later sold, or put to a taxable use by the manufacturer, tax attaches to such sale or use. An article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not used as material in the manufacture or production of or as a component part of, such other article.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Tax based on price.</E> Tax liability incurred on the use of an article shall be computed on the price at which such or similar articles are sold in the ordinary course of trade by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof and in the absence of special arrangements. For additional provisions applicable in computing the tax in the case of the use of an article by a manufacturer and producer who purchased the article free of tax under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by him in further manufacture, see section 4223(b) of the Code and the regulations thereunder (§ 53.143).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Articles regularly sold by manufacturer.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or <PRTPAGE P="211"/>importer of an article regularly sells such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, tax liability on his use of any such article shall be computed on his lowest established wholesale price for such articles in effect at the time of the taxable use. In establishing such price, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in sections 4216(a) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code, as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart L (§§ 53.91-53.94 and 53.173-53.176). If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article does not regularly sell such articles at wholesale in arm's length transactions, a constructive price on which the use tax shall be computed will be determined by the appropriate TTB officer. This price will be established after considering the selling practices and price structures of manfacturers, producers, and importers of similar articles.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Articles governed by section 4218(a) used in manufacture of nontaxable combination articles.</E> If the manufacturer, producer, or importer of an article to which section 4218(a) of the Code applies does not regularly sell such article separately but uses it as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a nontaxable combination article consisting of a taxable and nontaxable article, liability for tax on his use shall be computed on the constructive price of the taxable article at the time of use. To determine the constructive price of the taxable article in such case, the combination article is considered to be composed of:</P>
                <P>(1) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the taxable article in the combination;</P>
                <P>(2) Parts used exclusively in the functioning of the nontaxable article in the combination, and</P>
                <P>(3) Parts, called common parts, which serve a dual function in connection with the parts in both paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
                <FP>The ratio which the cost of the parts in paragraph (c)(1) of this section bears to the sum of the cost of such parts and the parts in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is applied to the lowest established wholesale price for which like combination articles are at the time of the taxable use being sold by the manufacturer or producer in the ordinary course of trade. The resulting amount is the constructive sale price for the taxable article on which tax is to be computed. The cost of the common parts is allocable to the parts in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section in the same ratio, and, therefore, need not be taken into account in the computation since the inclusion and allocation of the cost of such parts in the determination would not result in a different ratio. In determining the lowest establishment wholesale price for the combination article, there shall be included and excluded, as applicable, the charges and readjustments specified in sections 4216(a) and 6416(b)(1) of the Code, as in effect at the time tax liability on the use of the taxable article is incurred, and the regulations thereunder contained in this subpart and subpart L of this part (§§ 53.91-53.94 and §§ 53.173-53.176). The tax applicable to the use of the article for which a constructive sale price has been computed is not affected by any charges or readjustments of the price for which the nontaxable combination article is sold, whether by reason of the return or repossession of the nontaxable article or its covering or container, or by a bona fide discount, rebate, allowance, or other factor.</FP>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If the title to, or ownership of, an article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code is transferred from the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, and, under the law, no tax attaches to such transfer, the subsequent sale, lease, or use of such article by the transferee is subject to tax to the same extent and manner as <PRTPAGE P="212"/>if such transferee were the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the article. The following examples illustrate this rule:</P>
                <P>(1) The surviving spouse, child or children, executors or administrators, or other legal representatives, as the case may be, of a deceased manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incur liability for tax on all such articles sold by them.</P>
                <P>(2) A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy who under a court order conducts or liquidates the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by him, regardless of whether the articles were manufactured, produced, or imported before or after he took charge of the business.</P>
                <P>(3) An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer, producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.</P>
                <P>(4) If one or more member of a partnership withdraw, or if new partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.</P>
                <P>(5) A person who acquires title to taxable articles as a result of default of the manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to an agreement under the terms of which the articles were pledged as collateral incurs liability for tax with respect to his sale of the articles so acquired.</P>
                <P>(6) A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:</P>
                <P>(i) A corporation which results from a consolidation, merger, or reorganization;</P>
                <P>(ii) A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or partnership; or</P>
                <P>(iii) A stockholder in a corporation who, after its dissolution, continues the business;</P>
                <FP>incurs liability for the tax on all taxable articles sold by such person. However, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer sells only his assets, rather than ownership of his business, he incurs liability for tax on the sale of any taxable articles included in such assets.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Transfer of title to damaged articles.</E> If title to a damaged taxable article is transferred by the manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof to a carrier or insurance company in adjustment of a damage claim, such transfer is not considered a taxable sale of the article. If the article is usable, even though damaged, the carrier or insurance company incurs liability for tax on its sale, lease, or use of the article. Where the article has been damaged to the extent that its only value is as scrap, and it is not restored to usable condition, sale thereof by the carrier or insurance company is not subject to tax.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Section 4221(a) of the Code sets forth the following exempt purposes for which an article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax-free by the manufacturer, producer, or importer:</P>
              <P>(1) For use by the purchaser for further manufacture, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for use by such second purchaser in further manufacture,</P>
              <P>(2) For export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export,</P>
              <P>(3) For use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft,</P>

              <P>(5) To a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use.</P>

              <FP>Section 4221(a) of the Code applies only in those cases where the exportation or use referred to is to occur before any other use, and where the seller, first purchaser, and second purchaser, as may be appropriate, have registered as required under section 4222 of the Code and paragraph (a) of § 53.140. See paragraph (c) of this section for provisions relating to evidence required in support of tax-free sales. See § 53.141 for exceptions to the requirement for registration. Where tax is paid on the sale of an article, but the article is used or resold for use for an exempt purpose, a <PRTPAGE P="213"/>claim for credit or refund may be filed in accordance with and to the extent provided in sections 6402(a) and 6416 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder (§§ 53.161 and 53.171-53.186).</FP>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Manufacturer relieved of liability in certain cases</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code, if an article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code is sold free of tax by the manufacturer of the article for an exempt purpose referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the manufacturer shall be relieved of any tax liability under chapter 32 of the Code with respect to such sale if the manufacturer in good faith accepts a proper certification by the purchaser that the article or articles will be used by the purchaser in the stated exempt manner. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a list of the exempt purposes referred to in section 4221(c) of the Code.</P>

              <P>(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for further manufacture by a first purchaser (see § 53.132),</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 4221(a)(3) of the Code, relating to supplies for vessels and aircraft (see § 53.134),</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Situations wherein section 4221(c) of the Code is not applicable.</E> The relief from liability for the payment of tax provided by section 4221(c) of the Code is not applicable with respect to sales made tax free on the assumption that one of the following sections of the Code provides exemption for such sales:</P>
              <P>(i) Section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, to the extent that it relates to sales for resale to a second purchaser for use by the second purchaser in further manufacture (see § 53.132),</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 4221(a)(2) of the Code, relating to sales for export (see § 53.133).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Duty of seller to ascertain validity of tax-free sale.</E> If the manufacturer at the time of its sale has reason to believe that the article sold by it is not intended for the exempt purpose indicated by the purchaser, or that the purchaser has failed to register as required, the manufacturer is not considered to have accepted certification from the purchaser in good faith, and is not relieved from liability under the provisions of section 4221(c) of the Code.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Information to be furnished to purchaser.</E> A manufacturer selling articles free of tax under this section shall indicate to the purchaser that:</P>
              <P>(i) Certain articles normally subject to tax are being sold tax free, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The purchaser is obtaining those articles tax free for an exempt purpose under an exemption certificate or its equivalent.</P>
              <P>(6) The manufacturer may transmit this information by any convenient means, such as coding of sales invoices, provided that the information is presented with sufficient particularity so that the purchaser is informed that he has obtained the articles tax free and:</P>
              <P>(i) The purchaser can compute and remit the tax due if an article sold tax free for further manufacture is diverted to a taxable use,</P>
              <P>(ii) The manufacturer can remit the tax due with respect to an article purchased tax free for resale for use in further manufacture or for export if, within the 6-month period described in § 53.132(c) or § 53.133(c), the manufacturer does not receive proof that the article has been exported or resold for use in further manufacturer, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The purchaser can notify the manufacturer if an article otherwise purchased tax free is diverted to a taxable use.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence required in support of tax-free sales</E>—(1) <E T="03">Purchasers required to be registered.</E> Every purchaser who is required to be registered (see § 53.140) shall furnish to the seller, as evidence in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchaser, the exempt purpose for which the article or articles are being purchased and the registration number of the purchaser. <PRTPAGE P="214"/>Such information must be in writing and may be noted on the purchase order or other document furnished by the purchaser to the seller in connection with each sale.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Purchasers not required to be registered.</E> For the evidence which purchasers not required to register must furnish to the seller in support of each tax-free sale made by the seller to such purchasers, see paragraph (b) of § 53.133 for sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, paragraph (d) of § 53.134 for sales of supplies to vessels or aircraft, paragraph (c) of § 53.135 for sales to State and local governments, and paragraph (c) of § 53.141 for sales and purchases by the United States.</P>

See section 4221(d) (6) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture. See section 6416(b)(3) of the Code and § 53.180 for the circumstances under which credit or refund is available when tax-paid articles are used in further manufacture.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture.</E> (1) For purposes of the exemption from the manufacturers excise tax provided by section 4221(a)(1) of the Code, an article shall be treated as sold for use in further manufacture if the article is sold for use by the purchaser as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, another article taxable under chapter 32 of the Code;</P>
              <P>(2) An article is used as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component of, another article if it is incorporated in, or is a part or accessory of, the other article when the other article is sold by the manufacturer. In addition, an article is considered to be used as material in the manufacture of another article if it is consumed in whole or in part in testing such other article; for example, shells or cartridges that are used by the manufacturer of firearms to test new firearms. However, an article that is consumed in the manufacturing process other than in testing, so that it is not a physical part of the manufactured article, is not considered to have been used as material in the manufacture of, or as a component part of, another article.</P>

If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, such proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the <PRTPAGE P="215"/>article was actually sold. If the manufacturer later obtains such proof, it may file a claim for refund or credit of this tax. The payment of this tax by the manufacturer is not considered an overpayment by the subsequent manufacturer or producer for which the subsequent manufacturer or producer is entitled to a credit or refund under section 6416(b)(3) of the Code. See section 4221(d)(6) of the Code and paragraph (b) of this section for the circumstances under which an article is considered to have been sold for use in further manufacture.</P>

In the case of an invoice of manufacturer's vendee, it must appear from such invoice (or by statement attached thereto) that the article was in fact resold for use in further manufacture. In lieu of such an invoice, proof of resale may consist of a statement, executed and signed by the manufacturer's vendee which includes the following:</P>

              <P>(E) Statement that person executing statement or manufacturer's vendee possesses proof of tax-free resale of the article(s) in the form of purchase orders and sales invoices and identifying the person who will maintain custody of such proof for 3 years from the date of the statement and will make such proof available for inspection by TTB during such 3 year period.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, for export, or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export. See § 53.11 for the meaning of the term “exportation”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of this section only if the person to whom the manufacturer sells the article intends either to export the article or to resell it to a person who intends to export it. An article may not be sold tax free under the provisions of this section by a manufacturer to a <PRTPAGE P="216"/>purchaser for resale to a second purchaser which does not intend to export the article itself but plans to resell it to a third purchaser for export. See section 6416(b)(2)(A) of the Code and § 53.177 for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are exported from the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) If an article, otherwise taxable under chapter 32 of the Code:</P>
              <P>(i) Is sold tax free by the manufacturer pursuant to section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and this section, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Is returned subsequently to the United States in an unused and undamaged condition,</P>
              <FP>then the importer is liable for the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the subsequent sale or use of the article in the United States. The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</FP>

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example (1).</HD>
                <P>Q, a U.S. manufacturer of shells and cartridges, previously sold shells and cartridges to R, a company in Canada. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). Prior to use, R sold the shells and cartridges to S, who imports the articles into the United States and sells them. The sale of the shells and cartridges subjects S to an excise tax liability under section 4181.</P>

                <P>X, a U.S. firearms manufacturer, sold a rifle to Y company in France. The sale was tax free under section 4221(a)(2). The rifle was sold by Y to W, an individual in the City of Nice, France. After initial use, W resold the rifle to X. X returned the rifle to the United States where it was resold. The resale of the rifle by X does not subject X to an excise tax liability under section 4181.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export.</E> In the case of sales or resales to a foreign purchaser for export, if the first or the second purchaser is located in a foreign country or possession of the United States, such purchaser is not required to register as provided in section 4222(a) of the Code and § 53.140. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain from such purchaser at the time title to the article passes or at the time of shipment, whichever is earlier, either:</P>
              <P>(1) A written order or contract of sale showing that the manufacturer is to ship the article to a foreign destination; or</P>
              <P>(2) Where delivery by the manufacturer is to be made within the United States, a statement from the purchaser showing:</P>
              <P>(i) That the article is purchased either to fill existing or future orders for delivery to a foreign destination or for resale to another person engaged in the business of exporting who will export the article, and</P>
              <P>(ii) That such article will be transported to its foreign destination in due course prior to use or further manufacture and prior to any resale except for export. See section 4221(b) of the Code and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section for requirements as to timely proof of exportation and cessation of the exemption for export unless the evidence to show actual exportation has been received by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Cessation of exemption.</E> The exemption provided in section 4221(a)(2) of the Code and paragraph (a) of this section for an article sold by the manufacturer for export or for resale by the purchaser to a second purchaser for export shall cease to apply on the first day following the close of the 6-month period which begins on the date of the sale of the article by the manufacturer, or the date of shipment of the article by the manufacturer, whichever is earlier, unless within the 6-month period the manufacturer receives proof, in the form prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section, that the article was actually exported. If, on the first day following the close of the 6-month period, the proof has not been received, the manufacturer shall become liable for tax at that time at the rate in effect when the sale was made but otherwise in the same manner as if the article had been sold by it on such first day at a taxable price equivalent to that at which the article was actually sold.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Proof of exportation.</E> (1) Exportation may be evidenced by:</P>
              <P>(i) A copy of the export bill of lading issued by the delivering carrier,</P>

              </P>
              <P>(iii) A certificate of landing signed by a customs officer of the foreign country to which the article is exported,</P>
              <P>(iv) Where the foreign country has no customs administration, a statement of the foreign consignee showing receipt of the article, or</P>
              <P>(v) Where a department or agency of the United States Government is unable to furnish any one of the foregoing four types of proof of exportation, a statement or certification on the department or agency stationery, executed by an authorized officer, that the listed or identified articles have, in fact, been exported.</P>
              <P>(2) In any case where the manufacturer is not the exporter, the manufacturer must have in its possession a statement from the vendee to whom the manufacturer sold the article stating the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Date statement was executed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Name and address of manufacturer's vendee (if other than the person executing statement).</P>
              <P>(iii) Certificate of registry number held by vendee.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Supplies for vessels or aircraft</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> An article subject to tax under chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(3) of the Code and this section, for use by the purchaser as supplies for vessels or aircraft. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “supplies for vessels or aircraft.” An article may be sold tax free under the provisions of this section only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to the owner, officer, charterer, or authorized agent of a vessel or aircraft for use as supplies for the vessel or aircraft. No sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale for use as supplies for vessels or aircraft, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. See section 6416(b)(2)(B) of the Code and paragraph (c) of § 53.178 for circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are used, or sold for use, as supplies for vessels or aircraft.

              <SUBJECT>Tax-free sale of articles to State and local governments for their exclusive use.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> An article subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer, pursuant to section 4221(a)(4) of the code and this section, to a State or local government for the exclusive use of such State or local government. See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “State or local government”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale is made directly to a State or local government for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a State or local government for its exclusive use, even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that the article will be so resold. A sale of an article to a State or local government for resale is not considered to be a sale for the “exclusive use” of the State or local government, within the meaning of section 4221(a)(4) of the Code, and, therefore, such sales may not be made tax free. Such sales are not exempt regardless of whether the resales are made to government employees, or the fact that the article is an item of equipment the employee is required to possess in carrying out his duties. For example, pistols or revolvers may not be sold tax free to a State or local government for resale to its police officers. See section 6416(b)(2)(C) of the Code, and paragraph (d) of § 53.178, for the circumstances under which credit or refund of tax is available where tax-paid articles are sold for the exclusive use of a State or local government.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">State or local government.</E> The term <E T="03">State or local government</E> includes any State, the District of Columbia, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing. <E T="03">See,</E> section 7871(a)(2)(B) of the Code and 26 CFR 305.7701-1 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> which provide that an Indian tribal government shall be treated as a State for purposes of exemption from an excise tax imposed by chapter 32. Section 7871(b) of the Code provides that the exemption from tax applies only if the transaction involves the exercise of an essential governmental function of the Indian tribal government.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Evidence required in support of tax-free sales to State or local governments.</E> (1) In the case of a State or local government which is registered (see § 53.141 for provisions under which a State or local government may register if it so desires), the provisions of paragraph (c) <PRTPAGE P="221"/>of § 53.131 have application as to the evidence required in support of tax-free sales. If a State or local government is not registered, the evidence required in support of a tax-free sale to the State or local government shall, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, consist of a certificate, executed and signed by an officer or employee authorized by the State or local government to execute and sign the certificate. If it is impracticable to furnish a separate certificate for each order or contract because of frequency of purchases, a certificate covering all orders between given dates (such period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters) will be acceptable. The certificates and proper records of invoices, orders, etc., relative to tax-free sales must be retained by the manufacturer as provided in § 53.24(d). A certificate of exemption to support tax-free sales under this section must contain the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Title of official executing certificate, branch of government, date executed, and statement that official is authorized to execute certificate.</P>
              <P>(ii) List articles covered by the certificate or beginning and ending dates during which orders will be placed by the purchaser (period not to exceed 12 calendar quarters).</P>
              <P>(iii) Name of manufacturer from which articles purchased.</P>
              <P>(iv) Governmental unit purchasing articles.</P>
              <P>(v) Statement that is understood that articles purchased under this certificate of exemption are limited to use exclusively by the purchasing governmental entity.</P>
              <P>(vi) Statement that is understood that any fraudulent use of this certificate may subject the person executing the certificate and all parties making fraudulent use of the certificate to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.</P>
              <P>(vii) Name, address, and signature of person executing the certificate.</P>
              <P>(2) A purchase order, provided that all of the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is included therein, is acceptable in lieu of a separate exemption certificate.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">TTB I 5600.35.</E> A preprinted certificate, TTB I 5600.35, Exemption Certificate, which is available as provided in § 53.21(b), when completed, contains all necessary information for a properly executed certificate. Extra copies of TTB I 5600.35 may be reproduced as needed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Resale of articles purchased tax free by a State or local government.</E> If articles purchased tax free for the exclusive use of a State or local government (whether on the basis of a registration number or an exemption certificate) are, prior to use by the State or local government, resold under circumstances that do not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government (such as pistols or revolvers that are resold by a police department to its police officers), the parties responsible in the State or local government are required to inform the manufacturer, producer, or importer from whom the articles were purchased that they were disposed of in a manner that did not amount to an exclusive use by the State or local government. A willful failure to supply the manufacturer, producer, or importer with the information required by this subparagraph will subject responsible parties to the penalties provided by section 7203 of the Code.</P>

See paragraph (b) of this section for the meaning of the term “nonprofit educational organization”. An article may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under this paragraph only in those cases where the sale of an article by the manufacturer is made directly to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use. Accordingly, no sale may be made tax free to a dealer for resale to a nonprofit educational organization for its exclusive use even though it is known at the time of sale by the manufacturer that <PRTPAGE P="222"/>the article will be so resold.

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nonprofit educational organization.</E> The term “nonprofit educational organization” means an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code that is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code. Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) describes an “educational organization” as one that normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on. The term also includes a school operated as an activity of an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Code which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a) of the Code, provided the primary function of such school is the presentation of formal instruction and provided such school normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on.</P>

To establish the right to sell articles tax free to a State or local government that is not registered, the manufacturer must obtain from an authorized official of the State or local government and retain in the manufacturer's possession either a properly executed exemption certificate, or a purchase order that contains the same information required to be furnished in an exemption certificate. See § 53.135(c) for the information necessary to substantiate a tax-free sale under such circumstances.</P>
              <P>(2) Each State requesting registration will be assigned one Certificate of Registry. The registration number shown on this certificate may be used by all agencies, boards, and commissions of the State that are authorized by the State to make purchases for the exclusive use of the State. However, the registration number assigned to a State may not be used by any political subdivision of that State, such as a county or municipality. Each political subdivision of a State desiring to obtain a Certificate of Registry must obtain a separate registration number.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Sales or resales to foreign purchasers for export.</E> Persons whose principal place of business is not within the United States may, but are not required to, register in order to purchase articles tax free for export. To establish the right to sell articles tax free for export to a purchaser who is not registered and who is located in a foreign country or a possession of the United States, the manufacturer must obtain the evidence required by § 53.133(b).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">United States.</E> The registration requirements of the regulations in this part do not apply to purchases and sales by the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The evidence required in support of such tax-free purchases and sales is a notation on the purchase order or other document furnished to the seller clearly indicating that the article or articles are being purchased tax free as authorized by chapter 32 of the Code.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Supplies for vessels and aircraft.</E> An article subject to an excise tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code may be sold tax free by the manufacturer under the provisions of § 53.134 for use by the purchaser as supplies for a vessel or aircraft if both the manufacturer and the purchaser are registered under the provisions of § 53.140. The article also may be sold tax free for such use even though neither the manufacturer nor the purchaser is so registered if the provisions of paragraph (d) of § 53.134 are satisfied.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Special rules relating to further manufacture.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purchasing manufacturer to be treated as the manufacturer.</E> For purposes of Chapter 32 of the Code, a manufacturer or producer to whom an article is sold or resold tax free under section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use by it in further manufacture shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of such article. If a manufacturer who purchases an article tax free for further manufacture does not use the article for further manufacture, the sale of the article by it, or its use of the article other than in further manufacture, shall, for purposes of the taxes imposed by chapter 32 of the Code, be treated as a sale or use of the article by the manufacturer thereof. See paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section for determination of taxable sale price where an article purchased tax free for further manufacture is resold, or used other than in further manufacture.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Computation of tax.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the tax liability referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be based on the price for which the article was sold by the purchasing manufacturer, or, where the manufacturer uses the article for a purpose other than that for which it was purchased, the tax shall be based on the price at which such or similar articles are sold, in the ordinary course of trade, by manufacturers, producers, or importers thereof. See section 4218(e) of the Code and § 53.115.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Election.</E> (1) Instead of computing the tax as described under paragraph (b) of this section, the purchasing manufacturer who has incurred liability for tax on its sale or use of an article as provided by paragraph (a) of this section may compute the tax incurred under chapter 32 of the Code by using as the tax base either the price for which the article was sold to it by the first purchaser, if any, or the price for which such article was sold by the actual manufacturer, producer, or importer of such article. The purchasing manufacturer must have in its possession information upon which to substantiate such basis for tax. For purposes of this paragraph, the price for which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer or by the first purchaser shall be determined as provided in section 4216 of the Code and §§ 53.91-53.102. However, such price shall not be adjusted for any discount, rebate, allowance, return, or repossession of a container or covering, or otherwise.</P>
              <P>(2) The election under this paragraph shall be in the form of a statement attached to the return reporting the tax applicable to the sale or use of the article which gave rise to such tax liability. Such election, once made, may not be revoked.</P>

Such persons shall file and pay tax for periods only when liability is incurred. See § 53.159(b)(2), providing that a deposit of taxes is not required for a one-time or occasional filing.</P>

Every person so notified by the appropriate TTB officer shall file a return for the calendar month or semimonthly period in which the notice is received and for each calendar month or semimonthly period thereafter until the person has filed a final return in accordance with § 53.152 or is required to file returns on the basis of a different return period pursuant to notification as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Change of requirement.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may require the taxpayer, by notice in writing, to file a quarterly or monthly return, if the taxpayer has been filing returns for a semimonthly period, or may require the taxpayer to file a quarterly or semimonthly return, if the taxpayer has been filing monthly returns.</P>

              <P>(ii) If a taxpayer who has been filing monthly or semimonthly returns receives notice to file a quarterly return, the last month or semimonthly period for which a return shall be filed is the last month or semimonthly period of the calendar quarter in which the notice is received.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted for filing any return statement or other document required with respect to the taxes impose by chapter 32, because the information required for the filing of <PRTPAGE P="227"/>those documents is under normal circumstances readily available. However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control, a taxpayer believes an extension of time for filing is justified, the taxpayer may apply to the appropriate TTB officer for an extension. An extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension.

It should be made on or before the due date of the return, and failure to do so many indicate negligence and constitute sufficient cause for denial.

However, if because of temporary conditions beyond the taxpayer's control a taxpayer believes an extension of time for payment is justified, the taxpayer may apply for an extension filing TTB Form 5600.38. The period of an extension shall not be in excess of 6 months from the date fixed for payment of the tax, except that if the taxpayer is abroad the period of the extension may be in excess of 6 months.</P>
              <P>(2) The granting of an extension of time for filing a return does not operate to extend the time for the payment of the tax or any part of the tax unless so specified in the extension. See § 53.155.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Undue hardship required for extension.</E> An extension of the time for payment shall be granted only upon a satisfactory showing that payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired will result in an undue hardship. The extension will not be granted upon a general statement of hardship. The term “undue hardship” means more than an inconvenience to the taxpayer. It must appear that substantial financial loss, for example, loss due to the sale of property at a sacrifice price, will result to the taxpayer from making payment on the due date of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. If a market exists, the sale of property at the current market price is not ordinarily considered as resulting in an undue hardship.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Application for extension.</E> An application for an extension of time for payment of the tax shown or required to be shown on any return shall be made on TTB Form 5600.38, Application for Extension of Time for Payment of Tax, and shall be accompanied by evidence showing the undue hardship that would result to the taxpayer if the extension were refused. The application shall also be accompanied by a statement of the assets and liabilities of the taxpayer and an itemized statement showing all receipts and disbursements for each of the 3 months immediately preceding the due date of the amount to which the application relates. The application, with supporting documents, must be filed on or before the date prescribed for payment of the amount with respect to which the extension is desired. The application will be examined, and within 30 days, if possible, will be denied, granted, or tentatively granted subject to certain conditions of which the taxpayer will be notified. If an additional extension is desired, the request for it must be made on or before the expiration of the period for which the prior extension is granted.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Payment pursuant to extension.</E> If an extension of time for payment is granted, the payment shall be made on or before the expiration of the period of the extension without the necessity of notice and demand. The granting of an extension of time for payment of the tax does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of interest on <PRTPAGE P="228"/>the tax during the period of the extension.

              <SUBJECT>Payment of tax by electronic fund transfer.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> For return periods after September 30, 1992, any taxpayer liable for firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part may elect to remit payments and deposits of the taxes (taxpayments) by electronic fund transfer (EFT). A taxpayer who elects to make remittance by EFT must use that method of remitting excise taxes on firearms and ammunition for a minimum of four consecutive calendar quarters. A taxpayer who makes remittance by EFT for a calendar quarter may not use any other method of remitting and ammunition excise taxes for that quarter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) On or before the 10th day of the calendar quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the taxpayer will begin remitting taxes by EFT, each taxpayer who elects to make remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating that remittances will be paid by EFT. Taxpayers who gave written notification in a previous calendar quarter electing to make remittances of tax by EFT are not required to give additional written notifications to continue remitting tax by EFT for succeeding calendar quarters.</P>
              <P>(2) For each deposit made or return filed in accordance with this subpart, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's financial institution to make an EFT in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request will be made to the financial institution early enough for the transfer of funds to be made to the Treasury Account no later than the close of business on the last day for making the deposit or filing the return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.153. The request will take into account any time limit established by the financial institution.</P>
              <P>(3) Taxpayers who elect to discontinue making remittances by EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes may make such election at any time following four consecutive calendar quarters in which tax is remitted by EFT. Taxpayers electing to discontinue making remittances by EFT shall remit the tax with the next deposit or return as prescribed in §§ 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.151 for remittances not made by EFT and notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written notification to the tax deposit form or return stating that remittance of firearms and ammunition excise taxes will no longer be made by EFT.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Remittance.</E> (1) Taxpayers who elect to make firearms and ammunition excise taxpayments by EFT shall file the deposit form and/or return with TTB in accordance with the applicable instructions on the forms.</P>
              <P>(2) Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by EFT is received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal Reserve Bank.</P>
              <P>(3) When the taxpayer directs the financial institution to effect an electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer through normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment and will be retained as part of the required records.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT.</E> The taxpayer is subject to penalties imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6651 and 6656, as applicable, for failure to make a payment or deposit of tax by EFT on or before the close of business on the prescribed last day for making such payment or deposit.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer an TTB Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer. This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer follows when preparing deposits, <PRTPAGE P="231"/>returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this subpart.</P>

Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, no deposit is required for any semimonthly period in which no tax liability is incurred.</P>

The first deposit for the current quarter shall be equal to the unpaid tax liability; thereafter, deposits shall be equal to the amount of tax liability incurred during that semimonthly period.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Amount of deposit; safe harbor rule based on look-back quarter liability</E>; <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, any person who made a return of tax on TTB Form 5300.26 reporting taxes for the second preceding calendar quarter (the “look-back quarter”), or who did not file a return for the look-back quarter because of the provisions of § 53.151(a)(2), is considered to have complied with the requirement for deposit of taxes for the current calendar quarter if—</P>

              <P>(iii) The amount of any underpayment of taxes for the current calendar quarter is paid by the due date of the return.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Modification for third calendar quarter.</E> The safe harbor rule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply for the third calendar quarter unless—</P>

              <P>(ii) Each deposit of taxes for the periods September 16-25 and September 26-30 is not less than 1/12th (8.34 percent) of the total tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Modification for tax rate increase</E>—(i) <E T="03">Application.</E> The safe harbor rule as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) is modified for the first and second calendar quarters beginning on or after the effective date of an increase in the rate of any tax prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 4181 to which this part 53 applies.</P>

              <P>(i) The deposit of taxes for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter is not less than 95 percent of the tax liability incurred with respect to those taxes during the semimonthly period;</P>
              <P>(ii) Each deposit is made on time; and</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Last day for filing.</E> (1) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if the due date of the deposit falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deposit and remittance shall be due on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, “legal holiday” is defined by section 7503 of the Code and 27 CFR 70.306(b) of this chapter.</P>

Taxpayers electing to remit deposits by EFT pursuant to § 53.158 shall prepare and submit Form 5300.26 or Form 5300.27 in accordance with the instructions contained in Procedure 92-1, Publication 5000.11. The timeliness of the deposit will be determined by the date it is received by the lockbox financial institution, or the TTB officer designated on the form accompanying the deposit, or the Treasury Account, when made by EFT. In order for deposits of less than $20,000 made by U.S. Mail to be considered received timely, the date of mailing must be on or before the second day preceding the due date of the deposit as evidenced by the official postmark of the U.S. Postal Service stamped on the cover in which the deposit was mailed. When the postmark on the cover is illegible, the burden of proving when the postmark was made will be on the taxpayer. When the taxpayer sends the deposit by registered mail or by certified mail, the date of registry or the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt of certified mail, as the case may be, shall be treated as the date of delivery of the deposit. Any deposit of $20,000 or more must be received by the last day prescribed for making such deposit, regardless of when mailed. Amounts deposited pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered to be paid on the last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the returns), or at the time deposited, whichever is later.</P>

Such a person will not be excused from making a deposit however, by the fact that no form has been furnished. A person not supplied with the form is required to obtain the form in ample time to make the required deposits within the time prescribed.

                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1. One-time filing or occasional filing.</HD>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Facts.</E> On October 18, 1995, A, an individual who lives in the United States purchases a custom made rifle outside the United States and imports it into the United States. A uses the rifle on October 20, 1995. A is liable for the firearms excise tax imposed by sections 4181 and 4218(a). Since A does not regularly sell rifles in arm's length transactions, a constructive sale price of $20,000 is determined (§ 53.115(b)). The amount of A's tax liability is $2200, 11 percent of the constructive sale price of the rifle. The liability is incurred during the fourth calendar quarter of 1995, the quarter during which the rifle is used (§ 53.111(d)). A did not import the rifle in the course of its trade or business and does not engage in any activities with respect to which tax is reportable on TTB Form 5300.26 in the course of a trade or business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Filing requirement.</E> A must file a return on Form 5300.26 (§ 53.151(a)) for the fourth calendar quarter of 1995 reporting A's $2200 firearms excise tax liability. The Form 5300.26 is due by January 31, 1996, the last day of the first month following the calendar quarter (§ 53.153(a)). Because A did not import the firearm in the course of its trade or business and does not engage in any activities with respect to which tax is reportable in the course of a trade or business, the return is a one-time filing or occasional filing.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Payment requirement.</E> Because A's Form 5300.26 is a one-time filing, A is not required to make deposits of tax (§ 53.159(b)(2)). Instead, A pays the $2200 of tax with the return.</P>

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2. Deposit requirement; based on look-back quarter liability.</HD>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Facts.</E> B is a manufacturer of firearms. B sells 75 pistols which have a taxable sale price of $500 each during the second calendar quarter of 1996. B sold 50 of the pistols in the first semimonthly period of May, 1996, and the other 25 pistols in the second semimonthly period of April, 1996. B did not incur tax liability in any other semimonthly period in the second quarter. The amount of B's tax liability for the second calendar quarter is $3,750, 10 percent of the taxable sale price of the pistols. B filed Form 5300.26 for the second preceding calendar quarter, the look-back quarter, on January 31, 1996 reporting tax liability in the amount of $2,700.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposit requirement.</E> B is required to make deposits of tax for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter because B has incurred more than $2,000 in liability for the current quarter. B may use the safe harbor rule based on look-back quarter liability to determine the amount of the required deposits (§ 53.159(c)(3)). Under this safe harbor rule, B's deposit for each semimonthly period must equal at least $450.00, <FR>1/6</FR> (16.67 percent) of the tax liability incurred for the look-back quarter. B's deposit must be timely and B must pay the amount of any underpayment by the due date of the return. Accordingly, B meets the deposit requirement if B makes the following deposits:</P>

During the fourth quarter of 1995, C did not make any taxable sales of shells or cartridges, thereby incurring no tax liability for that return period. C did not file Form 5300.26 for the fourth calendar quarter since no tax liability was incurred (§ 53.151(a)(2)). C made taxable sales in the second quarter of 1996 amounting to $25,500.00, incurring a tax liability of $2805.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposit requirement.</E> Ordinarily, C would be required to make deposits of tax for each semimonthly period in the calendar quarter because C's total liability for the current calendar quarter exceeds $2,000. However, since C incurred a tax liability of $0 in the second preceding calendar quarter (the look-back quarter) (§ 53.159(c)(3)), under the safe harbor rule, C is not required to make deposits of tax.</P>

                <P>(1) <E T="03">Facts.</E> D, a manufacturer of firearms, began business on 2/16/96. D sold 300 shotguns which had a taxable sales price of $210 each during the first quarter of 1996. D sold 70 shotguns in the second semimonthly period of February, 1996, 130 shotguns in the first semimonthly period of March, 1996 and 100 shotguns in the second semimonthly period of March, 1996. The amount of D's tax liability for the first quarter of 1996 is $6,930, 11 percent of the taxable sale price of the shotguns.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Deposit requirement.</E> D is required to make a deposit of tax when D's tax liability exceeds $2,000 (§ 53.159(c)(2)). Therefore, D must make a deposit of tax beginning with the first semimonthly period in March, the semimonthly period in which D's unpaid tax liability exceeded $2,000. Because D, a first time filer, does not have an established look-back quarter, D's deposit of tax must be at least 95 percent of the incurred tax liability. D is required to make deposits of at least 95 percent of incurred tax liability for every semimonthly period in the quarter thereafter. D's deposits must be timely and any underpayment of tax must be paid by the due date of the return. Accordingly, D meets the deposit requirement if D makes the following deposits:</P>

An article in transit at the first moment of the 15th day after the date of the determination is regarded as being held by the person to whom it was shipped, except that if title to the article does not pass until delivered to the person the article is deemed to be held by the shipper.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Overpayments described in section 6416(b)(2) of the Code</E>—(1) <E T="03">Claims included.</E> This paragraph applies only to claims for credit or refund of amounts paid as tax under chapter 32 of the Code that are determined to be overpayments by reason of section 6416(b)(2) of the Code (relating to tax payments in respect of certain uses, sales, or resales of a taxable article).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Supporting evidence required.</E> No credit or refund of an overpayment to which this paragraph (b) applies shall be allowed unless the person who paid the tax submits with the claim a statement, supported by sufficient available evidence, asserting that:</P>

              <P>(ii) The person repaid, or agreed to repay, the amount of the tax to the ultimate vendor of the article, or</P>
              <P>(iii) The person has secured, and will submit upon request of the appropriate TTB officer, the written consent of the ultimate vendor to the allowance of the credit or refund.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Price readjustments causing overpayments of manufacturers tax.</SUBJECT>

              <P>In the case of any payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code that is determined to be an overpayment by reason of a price readjustment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code and § 53.174 or § 53.175, the person who paid the tax may file a claim for refund of the overpayment or may claim credit for the overpayment on any return of tax under this subpart which the person subsequently files. Price readjustments may not be anticipated. However, if the readjustment <PRTPAGE P="237"/>has actually been made before the return is filed for the period in which the sale was made, the tax to be reported in respect of the sale may, at the election of the taxpayer, be based either:</P>
              <P>(a) On the price as so readjusted, or</P>
              <P>(b) On the original sale price and a credit or refund claimed in respect of the price readjustment.</P>
              <FP>A price readjustment will be deemed to have been made at the time when the amount of the readjustment has been refunded to the vendor or the vendor has been informed that the vendor's account has been credited with the amount. No interest shall be paid on any credit or refund allowed under this section. For provisions relating to the evidence required in support of a claim for credit or refund, see 27 CFR 70.123 (Procedure and Administration), § 53.172(a)(2) and § 53.176. For provisions authorizing the taking of a credit in lieu of filing a claim for refund, see section 6416(d) of the Code and § 53.185.</FP>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Rules of usual application</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amount treated as overpayment.</E> If the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code has been paid and thereafter the price of the article on which the tax was based is readjusted, that part of the tax which is proportionate to the part of the price which is repaid or credited to the purchaser is considered to be an overpayment. A readjustment of price to the purchaser may occur by reason of:</P>
              <P>(A) The return of the article,</P>
              <P>(B) The repossession of the article,</P>
              <P>(C) The return or repossession of the covering or container of the article, or</P>
              <P>(D) A bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance against the price at which the article was sold.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Requirements of price readjustment.</E> A price readjustment will not be deemed to have been made unless the person who paid the tax either:</P>
              <P>(A) Repays part or all of the purchase price in cash to the vendee,</P>
              <P>(B) Credits the vendee's account for part or all of the purchase price, or</P>
              <P>(C) Directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee.</P>
              <FP>In addition, to be deemed a price readjustment, the payment or credit must be contractually or economically related to the taxable sale that the payment or credit purports to adjust. Thus, commissions or bonuses paid to a manufacturer's own agents or salesperson for selling the manufacturer's taxable products are not price readjustments for purposes of this section, since those commissions or bonuses are not paid or credited either to the manufacturer's vendee or to a third party for the vendee's benefit. On the other hand, a bonus paid by the manufacturer to a dealer's salesperson for negotiating the sale of a taxable article previously sold to the dealer by the manufacturer is considered to be a readjustment of the price on the original sale of the taxable article, regardless of whether the payment to the salesperson is made directly by the manufacturer or to the salesperson through the dealer. In such a case, the payment is related to the sale of a taxable article and is made for the benefit of the dealer because it is made to the dealer's salesperson to encourage the sale of a product owned by the dealer. Similarly, payments or credits made by a manufacturer to a vendee as reimbursement of interest expense incurred by the vendee in connection with a so-called “free flooring” arrangement for the purchase of taxable articles is a price readjustment, regardless of whether the payment or credit is made directly to the vendee or to the vendee's creditor on behalf of the vendee.</FP>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitation on credit or refund.</E> The credit or refund allowable by reason of a price readjustment in respect of the sale of a taxable article may not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax originally due and payable on the article as the amount of the tax-included readjustment bears to the original tax-included sale price of the article.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Rules of special application</E>—(i) <E T="03">Constructive sale price.</E> If, in the case of a taxable sale, the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code is based on a constructive sale price determined <PRTPAGE P="238"/>under any paragraph of section 4216(b) of the Code and §§ 53.94-53.97, as determined without reference to section 4218 of the Code, then any price readjustment made with respect to the sale may be taken into account under this section only to the extent that the price readjustment reduces the actual sale price of the article below the constructive sale price.

              <EXAMPLE>
                <HD SOURCE="HED">Examples:</HD>
                <P>(A) A manufacturer sells a taxable article at retail for $110 tax included. Under section 4216(b)(1) of the Code the constructive sale price (tax included) of the article is determined to be $93. Thereafter, the manufacturer grants an allowance of $10 to the purchaser, which reduces the actual selling price (tax included) to $100. Since the readjustment price exceeds the amount of the constructive sale price, this readjustment is not recognized as a price readjustment under this section.</P>
                <P>(B) Subsequently, the manufacturer extends to the purchaser an additional price allowance of $10, thereby reducing the actual sale price to $90. Since the actual sale price is now $3 less than the constructive sale price of $93, the manufacturer has overpaid by the amount of tax attributable to the $3. Assuming the tax rate involved is 10 percent, and the prices involved are tax-included, the overpayment of tax would be $0.27, determined as follows:</P>

              </EXAMPLE>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Price determined under section 4223(b)(2) of the Code.</E> If a manufacturer (within the meaning of section 4223(a) of the Code) to whom an article is sold or resold free of tax in accordance with the provisions of section 4221(a)(1) of the Code for use in further manufacture diverts the article to a taxable use or sells it in a taxable sale, and pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code computes the tax liability in respect of the use or sale on the price for which the article was sold to the manufacturer or on the price at which the article was sold by the actual manufacturer, a reduction of the price on which the tax was based does not result in an overpayment within the meaning of section 6416(b)(1) of the Code of this section. Moreover, if a manufacturer purchases an article tax free and computes the tax in respect of a subsequent sale of the article pursuant to the provisions of section 4223(b)(2) of the Code, an overpayment does not arise by reason of readjustment of the price for which the article was sold by the manufacturer except where the readjustment results from the return or repossession of the article by the manufacturer, and all of the purchase price is refunded by the manufacturer. See, however, paragraph (b)(4) of this section as to repurchased articles.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Return of an article</E>—(1) <E T="03">Price readjustment.</E> If a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by Chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment results:</P>
              <P>(i) If the article is returned before use, and all of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or</P>
              <P>(ii) If the article is returned under an express or implied warranty as to quality or service, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, or</P>
              <P>(iii) If title is still in the seller, as, for example, in the case of certain installment sales contracts, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Return of purchase price.</E> For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if all of the purchase price of an article has been returned to the vendee, except for an amount retained by the manufacturer pursuant to contract as reimbursement of expense incurred in connection with the sale (such as a handling or restocking charge), all of the purchase price is considered to have been returned to the vendee.<PRTPAGE P="239"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Taxability of subsequent sale or use.</E> If, under any of the conditions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and all of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, the sale is considered to have been rescinded. Any subsequent sale or use of the article by the manufacturer will be considered to be an original sale or use of the article by the manufacturer which is subject to tax under Chapter 32 of the Code unless otherwise exempt. If under any such condition an article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax and only part of the purchase price is returned to the vendee, a subsequent sale of the article by the manufacturer will be subject to tax to the extent that the sale price exceeds the adjusted sale price of the first taxable sale.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Treatment of other transactions as repurchases.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a price readjustment will not result when a taxable article is returned to the manufacturer who paid the tax on the sale of the article, even though all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, since such a transaction will be considered to be a repurchase of the article by the manufacturer.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Repossession of an article.</E> If a taxable article is repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a part of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account, a price readjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. However, if the manufacturer later resells the repossessed article for a price in excess of the original adjusted sale price, the manufacturer will be liable for tax under chapter 32 of the Code to the extent that the resale price exceeds the original adjusted sale price.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Return or repossession of covering or container.</E> If the covering or container of a taxable article is returned to, or repossessed by the manufacturer who paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of the article, and all or a portion of the purchase price is repaid to the vendee or credited to the vendee's account by reason of the return or repossession of the covering or container, a price adjustment giving rise to an overpayment will result. If a taxable article is considered to have been repurchased, as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and the covering or container accompanies the taxable article as part of the transaction, the covering or container will also be considered to have been repurchased.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Bona fide discounts, rebates, or allowances</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Except as provided in § 53.175 (relating to readjustments in respect of local advertising), the basic consideration in determining, for purposes of this section, whether a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance has been made is whether the price actually by, or charged against, the purchaser has in fact been reduced by subsequent transactions between the parties. Generally, the price will be considered to have been readjusted by reason of a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance, only if the manufacturer who made the taxable sale repays a part of the purchase price in cash to the vendee, or credits the vendee's account, or directly or indirectly reimburses a third party for part or all of the purchase price for the direct benefit of the vendee, in consideration of factors which, if taken into account at the time of the original transaction, would have resulted at that time in a lower sale price. For example, a price readjustment will be considered to have been made when a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance is given in consideration of such factors as prompt payment, quantity buying over a specified period, the vendee's inventory of an article when new models are introduced, or a general price reduction affecting articles held in stock by the vendee as of a certain date. On the other hand, repayments made to the vendee do not effectuate price readjustments if given in consideration of circumstances under which the vendee has incurred, or is required to incur, an expense which, if treated as a separate item in the original transaction, would have been incudable in the price of the article for purposes of computing the tax.<PRTPAGE P="240"/>

An additional amount of Y dollars is paid to the dealer upon a showing by the dealer that the dealer has paid Y dollars to the salesperson who made the sale. In this case, the X dollars paid to the dealer by C constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance since payment of such amount is in the nature of a price reduction. In addition, the Y dollars paid to the dealer in reimbursement for the amount paid by the dealer to the salesperson who made the sale, also constitutes a bona fide discount, rebate, or allowance.</P>

However, if the article was sold under a contract providing that, if the article was lost, damaged, or destroyed in transit, title would revert to the vendor and the vendor would reimburse the vendee in full for the sale price, then the original sale is considered to have been rescinded. The vendor is entitled to credit or refund of the tax paid upon reimbursement of the full tax-included sale price to the vendee.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> If a manufacturer has paid the tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the price of any article sold by the manufacturer and thereafter has repaid a portion of the price to the purchaser or any subsequent vendee in reimbursement of expenses for local advertising of the article or any other article sold by the manufacturer which is taxable at the same rate under the same section of chapter 32 of the Code, the reimbursement will be considered a price readjustment constituting an overpayment which the manufacturer may claim as a credit or refund. The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made. The term “local advertising,” as used in this section, has the same meaning as prescribed by section 4216(e)(4) of the Code and includes generally, advertising which is broadcast over a radio station or television station, or appears in a newspaper or magazine, or is displayed by means of an outdoor advertising sign or poster.</P>

The amount of the reimbursement may not, however, exceed the limitation provided by section 4216(e)(2) of the Code and § 53.101, determined as of the close of the calendar quarter in which the reimbursement is made or as of the close of any subsequent calendar quarter of the same calendar year in which it is made.<PRTPAGE P="241"/>

              <P>(E) Statement that to the best knowledge and belief of the person executing the certificate, no statement in respect of the proof of exportation or certificate has previously been executed and that the person executing the certificate understands that any fraudulent use of the certificate may subject the person executing the certificate or any other party to all applicable criminal penalties under the Code.</P>
              <P>(F) Name, title, address and signature of person executing certificate and date signed.</P>
              <P>(G) Description of all articles covered by the certificate, with the corresponding vendor's invoice number, date of resale of article, quantity, whether articles were exported or used and the use made of article or to be made of article.</P>

                <P>(1) The summons is served on the person about whom information is being gathered, or any officer or employee of such person, or</P>

                <P>(2) The summons is served to determine whether or not records of the business transactions or affairs of an identified person have been made or kept, or<PRTPAGE P="255"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) The summons does not identify the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued (a “John Doe” summons issued under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7609(f)), or</P>
                <P>(4) The appropriate TTB officer petitions, and the court determines, on the basis of the facts and circumstances alleged, that there is reasonable cause to believe the giving of notice may lead to attempts to conceal, destroy, or alter records relevant to the examination, to prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion, or to flee to avoid prosecution, testifying or production of records.</P>
                <P>(b) Within 3 days of the day on which the summons was served, the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be served upon the person entitled to notice, or mailed by certified or registered mail to the last known address of such person, or, in the absence of a last known address, left with the person summoned. No examination of any records required to be produced under a summons as to which notice is required under paragraph (a) of this section may be made:</P>
                <P>(1) Before the close of the 23rd day after the day notice with respect to the summons is given in the manner provided in this paragraph, or</P>
                <P>(2) Where a proceeding under paragraph (c) of this section was begun within the 20-day period referred to in that paragraph and the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section have been met, expect in accordance with an order of the court having jurisdiction of such proceeding or with the consent of the person beginning the proceeding to quash.</P>
                <P>(c) If the person about whom information is being gathered has been given notice, that person has the right to institute, until and including the 20th day following the day such notice was served on or mailed, by certified or registered mail, to such notified person, a proceeding to quash the summons. During the time the validity of the summons is being litigated, the statutes of limitation are suspended under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e). Title 26 U.S.C. 7609 does not restrict the authority under 26 U.S.C. 7602 (or under any other provision of law) to examine records and witnesses without serving a summons and without giving notice of an examination.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Accountant.</E> A person is an “accountant” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(F) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if the person is registered, licensed, or certified under State law as an accountant.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Attorney.</E> A person is an “attorney” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(E) for purposes of determining whether that person is a third-party recordkeeper if the person is admitted to the bar of a State or the District of Columbia.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Credit cards</E>—(i) <E T="03">Person extending credit through credit cards.</E> The term “person extending credit through credit cards or similar devices” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C) generally includes any person who issues a credit card. It does not include a seller of goods or services that honors credit cards issued by other parties but does not extend credit on the basis of credit cards or similar devices issued by itself.</P>
                <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Similar devices to credit cards.</E> An object is a “similar device” to a credit card under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C) only if it is physical in nature, such as a coupon book, a charge plate, or a letter of credit. Thus, a person who extends credit by requiring credit customers to sign sales slips without requiring use of physical objects issued by that person is not a third-party recordkeeper under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">When third-party recordkeeper status arises.</E> A person is a “third-party recordkeeper” with respect to a given set of records only if the person made or kept the records in the person's capacity as a third-party recordkeeper. Thus, for instance, an accountant is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being an accountant) with respect to the accountant's records of a sale of property by the accountant to another person. Similarly, a credit card issuer is not a third-party recordkeeper (by reason of being a person extending credit through the use of credit <PRTPAGE P="256"/>cards or similar devices) with respect to:</P>
                <P>(1) Records relating to noncredit card transactions, such as a cash sale by the issuer to a holder of the issuer's credit card; or</P>
                <P>(2) Records relating to transactions involving the use of another issuer's credit card.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Duty of third-party recordkeeper</E>—(1) <E T="03">In General.</E> Upon receipt of a summons, the third-party recordkeeper (“recordkeeper”) must begin to assemble the summoned records. The recordkeeper must be prepared to produce the summoned records on the date which the summons states the records are to be examined regardless of the institution or anticipated institution of a proceeding to quash or the recordkeeper's intervention (as allowed under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a)(3)(C)) into a proceeding to quash.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Disclosing recordkeepers not liable</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> A recordkeeper, or an agent or employee thereof, who makes a disclosure of records as required by this section, in good faith reliance on the “Certificate of the Secretary” (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) or an order of a court requiring production of records, will not be liable for such disclosure to any customer, or to any party with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, or to any other person.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Certificate of the Secretary.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may issue to the recordkeeper a “Certificate of the Secretary” stating both:</P>
                <P>(A) That the 20-day period, within which a notified person may institute a proceeding to quash the summons has expired; and</P>
                <P>(B) That no proceeding has been properly instituted within that period.</P>
                <FP>The appropriate TTB officer may also issue a “Certificate of the Secretary” to the recordkeeper if the taxpayer, with respect to whose tax liability the summons was issued, expressly consents to the examination of the records summoned.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Reimbursement of costs.</E> Recordkeepers may be entitled to reimbursement of their costs of assembling and preparing to produce summoned records, to the extent allowed by 26 U.S.C. 7610, even if the summons ultimately is not enforced.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Notified person.</E> Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a), the Bureau must give a notice of summons to any person, other than the person summoned, who is identified in the description of the books and records contained in the summons in order that such person may contest the right of the Bureau to examine the summoned records by instituting a proceeding to quash the summons. Thus, if the Bureau issues a summons to a bank requesting checking account records of more than one person all of whom are identified in the description of the records contained in the summons, then all such persons are notified persons entitled to notice under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a). Therefore, if the Bureau requests the records of a joint bank account of A and B, both of whom are named in the summons, then both A and B are notified persons entitled to notice under 26 U.S.C. 7609(a).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Right to institute a proceeding to quash</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) grants a notified person the right to institute a proceeding to quash the summons in the United States district court for the district within which the person summoned resides or is found. Jurisdiction of the court is based on 26 U.S.C. 7609(b). The act of filing a petition in district court does not in and of itself institute a proceeding to quash under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2). Rather, the filing of the petition must be coupled with notice as required by 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Elements of institution of a proceeding to quash.</E> In order to institute a proceeding to quash a summons, the notified person (or the notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of the notified person) must, not later than the 20th day following the day the notice of the summons was served on or mailed to such notified person:</P>

                <P>(i) File a petition to quash in the name of the notified person in a district court having jurisdiction.<PRTPAGE P="257"/>
                </P>
                <P>(ii) Notify the Bureau by sending a copy of that petition by registered or certified mail to the Bureau employee and office designated to receive the copy in the notice of summons that was given to the notified person, and</P>
                <P>(iii) Notify the recordkeeper by sending to that recordkeeper by registered or certified mail a copy of the petition.</P>
                <FP>Failure to give timely notice to either the summoned party or the Bureau in the manner described in this paragraph means that the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash and the district court has no jurisdiction to hear the proceeding. Thus, for example, if the notified person mails a copy of the petition to the summoned person but not to the designated Bureau employee and office, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. Similarly, if the notified person mails a copy of such petition to the summoned person, but instead of sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail to the designated employee and office, the notified person gives the designated employee and office the petition by some other means, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to institute a proceeding to quash.</E> If the notified person fails to institute a proceeding to quash within 20 days following the day the notice was served on or mailed to such notified person, the Bureau may examine the summoned records following the 23rd day after notice of the summons was served on or mailed to the notified person (see 26 U.S.C. 7609(d)(1)).</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Presumption no notice has been mailed.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B) permits a notified person to institute a proceeding to quash by filing a petition in district court and notifying both the Bureau and the summoned person. Unless the notified person has notified both the Bureau and the summoned person in the appropriate manner, the notified person has failed to institute a proceeding to quash. If the copy of the petition has not been delivered to the summoned person or the person and office designated to receive the notice on behalf of the Bureau within 3 days from the close of the 20-day period allowed to institute a proceeding to quash, it is presumed that the notification has not been timely mailed.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In aid of the collection of certain liabilities</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2)(B) contains an exception to the general notice requirement when a summons is issued to a third-party recordkeeper. That section excepts summonses issued in aid of the collection of the liability of any person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered or the liability at law or in equity of any transferee of such a person.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Examples.</E> Examples of summonses referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:</P>
                <P>(i) Summonses issued to determine the amount held in a bank in the name of a person against whom an assessment has been made or judgment rendered;</P>
                <P>(ii) Summonses issued to enforce transferee liability for a tax which has been assessed.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Numbered account (or similar arrangement).</E> Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2), a summons issued solely to determine the identity of a person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement) with a bank or other institution is excepted from the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609. A “numbered account (or similar arrangement)” under 26 U.S.C. 7609(c)(2) is an account through which a person may authorize transactions solely through the use of a number, symbol, code name, or other device not involving the disclosure of the person's identity. A “person having a numbered account (or similar arrangement)” includes the person who opened the account and any person authorized to use the account or to receive records or statements concerning it.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Suspension while a proceeding under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) is pending.</E> Under <PRTPAGE P="258"/>26 U.S.C. 7609(e)(1), the statutes of limitations of 26 U.S.C. 6501 and 6531 are suspended if a notified person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued, or the notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of the notified person, takes any action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b).</P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Agent, nominee, etc.</E> A person is a notified person's agent, nominee, or other person acting under the direction or control of a notified person for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 7609(e) if the person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued has the ability in fact or at law to cause the agent, etc., to take the actions permitted under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b). Thus, in the case of a corporation, direction or control by the notified person may exist even though less than 50 percent of the voting power of the corporation is held by the notified person.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Period during which a proceeding, etc., is pending.</E> Under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e), the statute of limitations shall be suspended for the period during which a proceeding and any appeals regarding the enforcement of such summons is pending. This period begins on the date the petition to quash the summons is filed in district court. The period continues until all appeals are disposed of, or until the expiration of the period in which an appeal may be taken or a request for a rehearing may be made. Full compliance, partial compliance, and noncompliance have no effect on the suspension provisions. The periods of limitations which are suspended under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e) are those which apply to the taxable periods to which the summons relates.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Taking of action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b).</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) allows intervention by a notified person as a matter of right upon compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The phrase “takes any action as provided in subsection (b)”, found in 26 U.S.C. 7609(e), includes any intervention whether or not 26 U.S.C. 7609(b) is specifically mentioned in the order of the court allowing intervention. The phrase also includes the fulfilling of only part of the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2), relating to the right of a person to institute a proceeding to quash. Thus, for instance, if a notified person notifies a person who has been summoned by sending a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail but does not mail a copy of that notice to the appropriate person and office under 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)(2)(B), the notified person has taken an action under 26 U.S.C. 7609(e).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Suspension after 6 months of service of summons.</E> In the absence of the resolution of the third-party recordkeeper's response to the summons described in 26 U.S.C. 7609(c) or the summoned party's response to a summons described in 26 U.S.C. 7609(f) the running of any period of limitations under 26 U.S.C. 6501 or under 26 U.S.C. 6531 with respect to any person with respect to whose liability the summons is issued (other than a person taking action as provided in 26 U.S.C. 7609(b)) shall be suspended for the period:</P>
                <P>(1) Beginning on the date which is 6 months after the service of such summons, and</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> An appropriate TTB officer may approve such reward as he or she deems suitable for information that leads to the detection and punishment of any person guilty of violating any tax law administered by the Bureau or conniving at the same. The rewards provided for by 26 U.S.C. 7623 are limited in their aggregate to the sum appropriated therefor and shall be paid only in cases not otherwise provided for by law.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility to file claim for reward</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any person, other than certain present or former federal employees (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section), who submits, in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, information relating to the violation of tax laws administered and enforced by the Bureau, is eligible to file a claim for reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Federal employees.</E> No person who was an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury at the time he came into possession of information relating to violations of tax laws administered by the Bureau, or at the time he divulged such information, shall be eligible for reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section. Any other federal employee, or former federal employee, is eligible to file a claim for reward if the information submitted came to his knowledge other than in the course of his official duties.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Deceased informants.</E> A claim for reward may be filed by an executor, administrator, or other legal representative on behalf of a deceased informant if, prior to his death, the informant was eligible to file a claim for such reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section. Certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, or other similar evidence must be annexed to such a claim for reward on behalf of a deceased informant in order to show the authority of the legal representative to file the claim for reward.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Amount and payment of reward.</E> All relevant factors, including the value of the information furnished in relation to the facts developed by the investigation of the violation, must be taken <PRTPAGE P="261"/>into account in determining whether a reward must be paid, and, if so, the amount thereof. The amount of a reward shall represent what the appropriate TTB officer deems to be adequate compensation in the particular case, normally not to exceed 10 percent of the additional taxes, penalties, and fines which are recovered as a result of the information. No reward, however, shall be paid with respect to any additional interest that may be collected. Payment of a reward will be made as promptly as the circumstances of the case permit, but generally not until the taxes, penalties, or fines involved have been collected. However, the informant may waive any claim for reward with respect to an uncollected portion of the taxes, penalties, or fines involved, in which case the claim may be immediately processed. No person is authorized under these regulations to make any offer, or promise, or otherwise to bind the appropriate TTB officer with respect to the payment of any reward or the amount thereof.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Submission of information.</E> Persons desiring to claim rewards under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7623 and this section may submit information relating to violations of tax laws administered by the Bureau to an appropriate TTB officer. If the information is submitted in person, either orally or in writing, the name and official title of the person to whom it is submitted and the date on which it is submitted must be included in the formal claim for reward.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Anonymity.</E> No unauthorized person shall be advised of the identity of an informant.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Filing claim for reward.</E> An informant who intends to claim a reward under 26 U.S.C. 7623 should notify the person to whom he submits his information of such intention, and must file a formal claim, signed with his true name, as soon after submission of the information as practicable. If other than the informant's true name was used in furnishing the information, the claimant must include with his claim satisfactory proof of his identity as that of the informant. Claim for reward under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7623 must be made on TTB Form 3200.13. TTB Form 3200.13 should be obtained from the office where the information is filed.</P>

The appropriate TTB officers are further authorized and required to make the determinations and the assessments of such taxes.

                <P>(ii) Any transaction or act upon which a tax is required to be paid by means of a stamp occurs, the appropriate TTB officer, upon such information as can be obtained, must estimate the amount of the tax which has not been paid and the appropriate TTB officer must make assessment therefor upon the person the appropriate TTB officer determines to be liable for the tax. However, the appropriate TTB officer may not assess any tax which is payable by stamp unless the taxpayer fails to pay such tax at the time and in the manner provided by law or regulations.</P>
                <P>(2) If a taxpayer gives a check or money order as a payment for stamps but the check or money order is not paid upon presentment, then the appropriate TTB officer shall assess the amount of the check or money order against the taxpayer as if it were a tax due at the time the check or money order was received by appropriate TTB officer.</P>

                <P>(b) The executor, administrator, or other fiduciary representing the estate of the decedent, or the corporation, or the fiduciary representing the dissolved corporation, as the case may be, shall, after the return in question has been filed, file the request for prompt assessment in writing with the appropriate TTB officer. The request, in order to be effective, must be transmitted separately from any other document, must set forth the classes of tax and the taxable periods for which the prompt assessment is requested, and must clearly indicate that it is a request for prompt assessment under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6501(d). The effect of such a request is to limit the time in which an assessment of tax may be made, or a proceeding in court without assessment for collection of tax may be begun, to a period of 18 months from the date the request is filed with the appropriate TTB officer. The request does not extend the time within which an assessment may be made, or a proceeding in court without assessment shall be begun, after the expiration of 3 years from the date the return was filed. This special period of limitations will not apply to any return filed after a request for prompt assessment has been made unless an additional request is filed in the manner provided herein.</P>
                <P>(c) In the case of a corporation the 18-month period shall not apply unless:</P>
                <P>(1) The written request notifies the appropriate TTB officer that the corporation contemplates dissolution at or before the expirationof such 18-month period; the dissolution is in good faith begun before the expiration of such 18-month period; and the dissolution so begun is completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; or</P>
                <P>(2) The written request notifies the appropriate TTB officer that a dissolution has in good faith begun, and the dissolution is completed either before or after the expiration of such 18-month period; or</P>
                <P>(3) A dissolution has been completed at the time the written request is made.</P>

                <P>(a) The collection of taxes assessed under 26 U.S.C. 6862 (referred to as a “jeopardy assessment” for purposes of this section) of any tax may be stayed by filing with the appropriate TTB officer a bond on the form to be furnished by TTB upon request.</P>

                <P>(3) In the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, after any such levy has been made and before the expiration of the period of limitations on collection.</P>
                <P>(c) The bond must be in an amount equal to the portion (including interest thereon to the date of payment as calculated by the appropriate TTB officer) of the jeopardy assessment collection of which is sought to be stayed. See 26 U.S.C. 7101 and § 70.281, relating to the form of bond and the sureties thereon. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon), for which the collection is stayed, at the time at which, but for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.</P>
                <P>(d) Upon the filing of a bond in accordance with this section, the collection of so much of the assessment as is covered by the bond will be stayed. The taxpayer may at any time waive the stay of collection of the whole or of any part of the amount covered by the bond. If as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, or if any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated by the appropriate TTB officer, then the bond shall (at the request of the taxpayer) be proportionately reduced.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Interest at the underpayment rate referred to in § 70.93 of this part shall be paid on any unpaid amount of tax from the last date prescribed for payment of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time for payment) to the date on which payment is received.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Interest on penalties, additional amounts, or additions to the tax</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> Interest shall be imposed on any assessable penalty, additional amount, or addition to the tax (other than an addition to tax imposed under section 6651(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) only if such assessable penalty, additional amount, or addition to the tax is not paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand therefor, and in such case interest shall be imposed only for the period from the date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Interest on certain additions to tax.</E> Interest shall be imposed under this section on any addition to tax imposed by section 6651(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code for the period which (i) begins on the date on which the return of the tax with respect to which such addition to tax is imposed is required to be filed (including any extensions), and (ii) ends on the date of payment of such addition to tax.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payments made within 10 days after notice and demand.</E> If notice and demand is made for payment of any amount, and if such amount is paid within 10 days after the date of such notice and demand, interest under this section on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and demand.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Satisfaction by credits.</E> If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period during which, if the credit had not been made, interest would have been allowable with respect to such overpayment.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Last date prescribed for payment.</E> (1) In determining the last date prescribed for payment, any extension of time <PRTPAGE P="269"/>granted for payment of tax shall be disregarded. The granting of an extension of time for the payment of tax does not relieve the taxpayer from liability for the payment of interest thereon during the period of the extension. Thus, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, interest at the underpayment rate referred to in § 70.93 of this part is payable on any unpaid portion of the tax for the period during which such portion remains unpaid by reason of an extension of time for the payment thereof.</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of taxes payable by stamp and in all other cases where the last date for payment of the tax is not otherwise prescribed, such last date for the purpose of the interest computation shall be deemed to be the date on which the liability for the tax arose. However, such last date shall in no event be later than the date of issuance of a notice and demand for the tax.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Interest on overpayments.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except as otherwise provided, interest shall be allowed on any overpayment of any tax at the overpayment rate referred to in § 70.93 of this part from the date of overpayment of the tax.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Date of overpayment.</E> Except as provided in section 6401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to assessment and collection after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation, there can be no overpayment of tax until the entire tax liability has been satisfied. Therefore, the dates of overpayment of any tax are the date of payment of the first amount which (when added to previous payments) is in excess of the tax liability (including any interest, addition to the tax, or additional amount) and the dates of payment of all amounts subsequently paid with respect to such tax liability.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Period for which interest is allowable in case of refunds.</E> If an overpayment of tax is refunded, interest shall be allowed from the date of the overpayment to a date determined by the appropriate TTB officer which shall not be more than 30 days prior to the date of the refund check. The acceptance of a refund check shall not deprive the taxpayer of the right to make a claim for any additional overpayment and interest thereon, provided the claim is made within the applicable period of limitation. However, if a taxpayer does not accept a refund check, no additional interest on the amount of the overpayment included in such check shall be allowed.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Period for which interest allowable in case of credits</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If an overpayment of tax is credited, interest shall be allowed from the date of overpayment to the due date (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section of the amount against which such overpayment is credited.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Determination of due date</E>—(i) <E T="03">General.</E> The term <E T="03">due date,</E> as used in this section, means the last day fixed by law or regulations for the payment of the tax (determined without regard to any extension of time), and not the date on which the appropriate TTB officer makes demand for the payment of the tax. Therefore, the due date of the tax is the date fixed for the payment of the tax;</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Tax not due yet.</E> If a taxpayer agrees to the crediting of an overpayment against tax and the schedule of allowance is signed prior to the date on which such tax would otherwise become due, then the due date of such tax shall be the date on which such schedule is signed;</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Interest.</E> In the case of a credit against interest that accrues for any period ending prior to January 1, 1983, the due date is the earlier of the date of assessment of such interest or December 31, 1982. In the case of a credit <PRTPAGE P="270"/>against interest that accrues from any period beginning on or after December 31, 1982, such interest is due as it economically accrues on a daily basis, rather than when it is assessed.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty.</E> In the case of a credit against an additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty, the due date is the earlier of the date of assessment or the date from which such amount would bear interest if not satisfied by payment or credit.</P>

                <P>(i) Title 26 U.S.C. 61, relating to returns and records;</P>
                <P>(ii) Title 26 U.S.C. 51, relating to distilled spirits, wines and beer;</P>

The amount to be added to the tax is 5 percent therof if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional 5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The amount of any addition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for any month to which an addition to tax applies under both paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Failure to pay tax shown on return.</E> In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on any return required to be filed after December 31, 1969 (without regard to any extension of time for filing thereof), specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on or before the date prescribed for payment of such tax (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), there shall be added to the tax shown on the return the amount specified below unless the failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount of tax shown on the return if the failure is for not more than 1 month, with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Failure to pay tax not shown on return.</E> In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which is not so shown (including an assessment made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6213(b)) within 10 days from the date of the notice and demand therefor, there shall be added to the amount shown in the notice and demand the amount specified below unless the failure to pay the tax within the prescribed time is shown to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer to be due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. The amount to be added to the tax is 0.5 percent of the amount stated in the notice and demand if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional 0.5 percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure continues, but not to exceed 25 percent in the aggregate. The maximum amount of the addition permitted under this subparagraph shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within 10 days from the date of notice and demand. The preceding sentence applies to amounts assessed on or before December 31, 1986.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Increases in penalties in certain cases.</E> For increases in penalties for failure to file a return or pay tax in certain cases, see 26 U.S.C. 6651(d) or (f).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Month defined.</E> (1) If the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or pay tax continues shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651.</P>

                <P>(2) If the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax is a date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period which terminates with the <PRTPAGE P="272"/>date numerically corresponding thereto in the succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651. If, in the month of February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax, the period from such date in January through the last day of February shall constitute a month for purposes of section 6651. Thus, if a return is due on January 30, the first month shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.</P>
                <P>(3) If a return is not timely filed or tax is not timely paid, the fact that the date prescribed for filing the return or paying tax, or the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday is immaterial in determining the number of months for which the addition to the tax under section 6651 applies.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Showing of reasonable cause.</E> A taxpayer who wishes to avoid the addition to the tax for failure to file a tax return or pay tax must make an affirmative showing of all facts alleged as a reasonable cause for the taxpayers failure to file such return or pay such tax on time in the form of a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury. Such statement should be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. In addition, where special tax returns are delivered to an appropriate TTB officer, such statement may be delivered with the return. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the delinquency was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the addition to the tax will not be assessed. If the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed time, then the delay is due to a reasonable cause. A failure to pay will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent that the taxpayer has made a satisfactory showing that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of the tax liability and was nevertheless either unable to pay the tax or would suffer an undue hardship (as described in 26 CFR 1.6161-1(b)) if paid on the due date. In determining whether the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax in spite of the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment of a tax liability, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's financial situation, including the amount and nature of the taxpayer's expenditures in light of the income (or other amounts) the taxpayer could, at the time of such expenditures, reasonably expect to receive prior to the date prescribed for the payment of the tax. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who incurs lavish or extravagant living expenses in an amount such that the remainder of assets and anticipated income will be insufficient to pay the tax, has not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the payment of a tax liability. Further, a taxpayer who invests funds in speculative or illiquid assets has not exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for the payment of a tax liability unless, at the time of the investment, the remainder of the taxpayer's assets and estimated income will be sufficient to pay the tax or it can be reasonably foreseen that the speculative or illiquid investment made by the taxpayer can be utilized (by sale or as security for a loan) to realize sufficient funds to satisfy the tax liability. A taxpayer will be considered to have exercised ordinary business care and prudence if such taxpayer made reasonable efforts to conserve sufficient assets in marketable form to satisfy a tax liability and nevertheless was unable to pay all or a portion of the tax when it became due.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Penalty imposed on net amount due</E>—(1) <E T="03">Credits against the tax.</E> The amount of tax required to be shown on the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(1) and the amount shown as tax on the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(2) shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed on the return.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Partial payments.</E> (i) The amount of tax required to be shown on the return for purposes of section 6651(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code shall, for <PRTPAGE P="273"/>the purpose of computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid after the date prescribed for payment and on or before the first day of such month, and</P>
                <P>(ii) The amount of tax stated in the notice and demand for purposes of section 6651(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code shall, for the purpose of computing the addition for any month, be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the first day of such month.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">No addition to tax if fraud penalty assessed.</E> No addition to the tax under section 6651 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be assessed with respect to an underpayment of tax if an addition to the tax for fraud is assessed with respect to the same underpayment under section 6653(b). See section 6653(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirement that claim be filed.</E> (1) Credits or refunds of overpayments may not be allowed or made after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation properly applicable unless, before the expiration of such period, a claim therefor has been filed by the taxpayer. Furthermore, under section 7422 of the Internal Revenue Code, a civil action for refund may not be instituted unless a claim has been filed within the properly applicable period of limitation.</P>
                <P>(2) All claims relating to provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau, together with appropriate supporting evidence, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. As to interest in the case of credits or refunds, see section 6611 of the Internal Revenue Code. See section 7502 for provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing and section 7503 for time for filing claim when the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Grounds set forth in claim.</E> (1) No refund or credit will be allowed after the expiration of the statutory period of limitation applicable to the filing of a claim therefor except upon one or more of the grounds set forth in a claim filed before the expiration of such period. The claim must set forth in detail each ground upon which credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the appropriate TTB officer of the exact basis thereof. The statement of the grounds and facts must be verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A claim which does not comply with this paragraph will not be considered for any purpose as a claim for the refund or credit.</P>
                <P>(2) The appropriate TTB officers do not have authority to refund on equitable grounds penalties or other amounts legally collected.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Form for filing claim.</E> All claims by taxpayers for the refunding of taxes, interest, penalties, and additions to tax shall be made on Form 2635 (5620.8).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Proof of representative capacity.</E> If a return is filed by an individual and, after the individuals death, a refund claim is filed by a legal representative, certified copies of the letters testamentary, letters of administration, or other similar evidence must be annexed to the claim, to show the authority of the legal representative to file the claim. If an executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, receiver, or other fiduciary files a return and thereafter a refund claim is filed by the same fiduciary, documentary evidence to establish the legal authority of the fiduciary need not accompany the claim, provided a statement is made in the claim showing that the return was filed by the fiduciary and that the latter is still acting. In such cases, if a refund is to be paid, letters testamentary, letters of administration, or other evidence may be required, but should be submitted only upon the receipt of a specific request therefor. If a claim is filed by a fiduciary other than the one by whom the return was filed, the necessary documentary evidence should accompany the claim. A claim may be executed by an agent of the person assessed, but in such case a power of attorney must accompany the claim.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Mailing of refund check.</E> (1) Checks in payment of claims allowed will be drawn in the names of the persons entitled to the money and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the checks may be sent direct to the claimant or to such person in care of an attorney or agent who has filed a power of attorney specifically authorizing the attorney or agent to receive such checks.</P>

                <P>(2) Checks in payment of claims which have either been reduced to judgment or settled in the course or as a result of litigation will be drawn in the name of the person or persons entitled to the money and will be sent to the Assistant Attorney General, Tax Division, Department of Justice, for delivery to the taxpayer or the counsel of record in the court proceeding.<PRTPAGE P="279"/>

However, the provisions of § 70.123 of this part are applicable to such overpayment, and taxpayers should submit claims for refund to protect themselves in the event the appropriate TTB officer fails to make such determination and credit or refund.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Security interest</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term <E T="03">security interest</E> means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability. A security interest exists ay any time:</P>
                <P>(i) If, at such time, the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under local law against a subsequent judgment lien (as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) arising out of an unsecured obligation; and</P>
                <P>(ii) To the extent that, at such time, the holder has parted with money or money's worth (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section). For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a contract right (as defined in § 70.232(c)(2)(i) of this part) is in existence when the contract is made. An account receivable (as defined in § 70.232(c)(2)(ii) of this part) is in existence when, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance. A security interest must be in existence, within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section, at the time as of which its priority against a tax lien is determined. For example, to be afforded priority under the provisions of § 70.145(a) of this part, a security interest must be in existence within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section before a notice of lien is filed.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Protection against a subsequent judgment lien.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a security interest is deemed to be protected against a subsequent judgment lien on:</P>
                <P>(i) The date on which all actions required under local law to establish the priority of a security interest against a judgment lien have been taken, or</P>
                <P>(ii) If later, the date on which all required actions are deemed effective, under local law, to establish the priority of the security interest against a judgment lien.</P>
                <FP>For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the dates described in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be determined without regard to any rule or principle of local law which permits the relation back or the making of any requisite action retroactive to a date earlier than the date on which the action is actually performed. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Money or money's worth.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, <PRTPAGE P="281"/>the term “money or money's worth” includes money, a security (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), tangible or intangible property, services, and other consideration reducible to a money value. Money or money's worth also includes any consideration which otherwise would constitute money or money's worth under the preceding sentence which was parted with before the security interest would otherwise exist if, under local law, past consideration is sufficient to support an agreement giving rise to a security interest. A relinquishing or promised relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights is not a consideration in money or money's worth. Nor is love and affection, promise of marriage, or any other consideration not reducible to a money value a consideration in money or money's worth.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Holder of a security interest.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the holder of a security interest is the person in whose favor there is a security interest. For provisions relating to the treatment of a purchaser of commercial financing security as a holder of a security interest, see § 70.232(e) of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Mechanic's lienor.</E> The term <E T="03">mechanic's lienor</E> means any person who under local law has a lien on real property (or on the proceeds of a contract relating to real property) for services, labor, or materials furnished in connection with the construction or improvement (including demolition) of the property. A mechanic's lienor is treated as having a lien on the later of:</P>
                <P>(1) The date on which the mechanic's lien first becomes valid under local law against subsequent purchasers of the real property without actual notice, or</P>
                <P>(2) The date on which the mechanic's lienor begins to furnish the services, labor, or materials.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Motor vehicle.</E> (1) The term <E T="03">motor vehicle</E> means a self-propelled vehicle which is registered for highway use under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country.</P>
                <P>(2) A motor vehicle is “registered for highway use” at the time of a sale if immediately prior to the sale it is so registered under the laws of any State, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country. Where immediately prior to the sale of a motor vehicle by a dealer, the dealer is permitted under local law to operate it under a dealer's tag, license, or permit issued to the dealer, the motor vehicle is considered to be registered for highway use in the name of the dealer at the time of the sale.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Security.</E> The term <E T="03">security</E> means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, issued by a corporation or a government or political subdivision thereof, with interest coupons or in registered form, share of stock, voting trust certificate, or any certificate of interest or participation in, certificate of deposit or receipt for, temporary or interim certificate for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; negotiable instrument; or money.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Tax lien filing.</E> The term <E T="03">tax lien filing</E> means the filing of notice of the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 in accordance with § 70.148 of this part.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Purchaser</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term <E T="03">purchaser</E> means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth (as defined in paragraph (f)(3) of this section), acquires an interest (other than a lien or security interest) in property which is valid under local law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Interest in property.</E> For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, each of the following interests is treated as an interest in property, if it is not a lien or security interest:</P>
                <P>(i) A lease of property,</P>
                <P>(ii) A written executory contract to purchase or lease property,</P>
                <P>(iii) An option to purchase or lease property and any interest therein, or</P>
                <P>(iv) An option to renew or extend a lease of property.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.</E> For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the term “adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth” means a consideration in money or money's worth having a reasonable relationship to the true value of the interest in property acquired. See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for definition of the term “money or money's worth.” Adequate <PRTPAGE P="282"/>and full consideration in money or money's worth may include the consideration in a bona fide bargain purchase. The term also includes the consideration in a transaction in which the purchaser has not completed performance of an obligation, such as the consideration in an installment purchase contract where the purchaser has not completed the installment payments.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Judgment lien creditor.</E> The term <E T="03">judgment lien creditor</E> means a person who has obtained a valid judgment, in a court of record and of competent jurisdiction, for the recovery of specifically designated property or for a certain sum of money. In the case of a judgment for the recovery of a certain sum of money, a judgment lien creditor is a person who has perfected a lien under the judgment on the property involved. A judgment lien is not perfected until the identity of the lienor, the property subject to the lien, and the amount of the lien are established. Accordingly, a judgment lien does not include an attachment or garnishment lien until the lien has ripened into judgment, even though under local law the lien of the judgment relates back to an earlier date. If recording or docketing is necessary under local law before a judgment becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on real property, a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected with respect to real property until the time of such recordation or docketing. If, under local law, levy or seizure is necessary before a judgment lien becomes effective against third parties acquiring liens on personal property, then a judgment lien under such local law is not perfected until levy or seizure of the personal property involved. The term “judgment” does not include the determination of a quasi-judicial body or of an individual acting in a quasi-judicial capacity such as the action of State taxing authorities.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Actual notice or knowledge.</E> For purposes of 26 U.S.C. 6321 through 6327, an organization is deemed, in any transaction, to have actual notice or knowledge of any fact from the time the fact is brought to the attention of the individual conducting the transaction, and in any event from the time the fact would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless such communication is part of the individual's regular duties or unless the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Subrogation:</E> Where, under local law, one person is subrogated to the rights of another with respect to a lien or interest, such person shall be subrogated to such rights for purposes of any lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 or 6324. Thus, if a tax lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 or 6324 is not valid with respect to a particular interest as against the holder of that interest, then the tax lien also is not valid with respect to that interest as against any person who, under local law, is a successor in interest to the holder of that interest.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Disclosure of amount of outstanding lien.</E> If a notice of lien has been filed (see § 70.148 of this part), the amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien is authorized to be disclosed as a matter of public record on TTB Form 5651.2 “Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws.” The amount of the outstanding obligation secured by the lien remaining unpaid at the time of an inquiry is authorized to be disclosed to any person who has a proper interest in determining this amount. Any person who has a right in the property or intends to obtain a right in the property by purchase or otherwise will, upon presentation of satisfactory evidence, be considered to have a proper interest. Any person desiring this information may make a request to the office of the Bureau named on the notice of lien with respect to which the request is made. The request should clearly describe the property <PRTPAGE P="283"/>subject to the lien, identify the applicable lien, and give the reasons for requesting the information.</P>

Except as provided by 26 U.S.C. 6323, if a person becomes a purchaser, holder of a security interest, mechanic's lienor, or judgment lien creditor after a notice of lien is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the interest acquired by such person is subject to the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321.</P>

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Collection expenses.</E> The reasonable expenses described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of the lien or security interest to establish the priority of the holder's interest or to collect, by foreclosure or otherwise, the amount due the holder from the property subject to the protected holder's lien. Accordingly, the amount of the encumbrance which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the security interest.</P>

Such reasonable costs also include the amounts paid by the holder of the lien or security interest in a leasehold to the lessor of the leasehold to preserve the leasehold subject to the lien or security interest. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest which is protected is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Satisfaction of liens.</E> The amounts described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section include expenditures incurred by the protected holder of a lien or security interest to discharge a statutory lien for State sales taxes on the property subject to the lien or security interest if both the lien or security interest and the sales tax lien have priority over a Federal tax lien. Accordingly, the amount of the lien or security interest is increased by the amounts so expended by the holder of the lien or security interest even though under local law the holder of the lien or security interest is not subrogated to the rights of the holder of the State sales tax lien. However, if the holder of the lien or security interest is subrogated, within the meaning of § 70.144(b) of this part, to the rights of the holder of the sales tax lien, the holder of the lien or security interest will also be entitled to any additional protection afforded by 26 U.S.C. 6323(i)(2)</P>

                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Personal property.</E> In the case of personal property, whether tangible or intangible, the notice shall be filed in one office within the State (or the county or other governmental subdivision), as designated by the laws of the State, in which the property subject to the lien is deemed situated under the provision of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that State law merely conforming to or reenacting Federal law establishing a national filing system does not constitute a second office for filing as designated by the laws of such State.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Personal property.</E> Personal property, whether tangible or intangible, is deemed situated at the residence of the taxpayer at the time the notice of lien is filed.</P>
                <FP>For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the residence of a corporation or partnership is deemed to be the place at which the principal executive office of the business is located, and the residence of a taxpayer whose residence is not within the United States is deemed to be in the District of Columbia.</FP>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general</E>—(1) <E T="03">Requirement to refile.</E> In order to continue the effect of a notice of lien, the notice must be refiled in the place described in paragraph (b) of this section during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section). In the event that two or more notices of lien are filed with respect to a particular tax assessment, the failure to comply with the provision of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (c) of this section in respect of one of the notices of lien does not affect the effectiveness of the refiling of any other notice of lien. Except for the filing of a notice of lien required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (relating to a change of residence), the validity of any refiling of a notice of lien is not affected by the refiling or nonrefiling of any other notice of lien.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Effect of refiling.</E> A timely refiled notice of lien is effective as of the date on which the notice of lien to which it relates was effective.<PRTPAGE P="286"/>
                </P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of failure to refile.</E> Except as provided below, if the appropriate TTB officer fails to refile a notice of lien in the manner described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the notice of lien is not effective, after the expiration of the required refiling period, as against any person without regard to when the interest of the person in the property subject to the lien was acquired. However, the failure of the appropriate TTB officer to refile a notice of lien during the required refiling period will not, following the expiration of the refiling period, affect the effectiveness of the notice with respect to:</P>
                <P>(i) Property which is the subject matter of a suit, to which the United States is a party, commenced prior to the expiration of the required refiling period, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Property which has been levied upon by the United States prior to the expiration of the refiling period. However, if a suit or levy referred to in the preceding sentence is dismissed or released, respectively, and property is subject to the lien at such time, a notice of lien with respect to the property is not effective after the suit or levy is dismissed or released unless refiled during the required refiling period. Failure to refile a notice of lien does not affect the existence of the lien.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Filing of new notice.</E> If a notice of lien is not refiled, and if the lien remains in existence, the Bureau may nevertheless file a new lien either on the prescribed form for the filing of a notice of lien or on the form prescribed for refiling a notice of lien. This new filing must meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) and § 70.148 of this part and is effective from the date on which such filing is made.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Place for refiling notice of lien</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A notice of lien refiled during the required refiling period (described in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be effective only:</P>
                <P>(i) If the notice of lien is refiled in the office in which the prior notice of lien (including a refiled notice) was filed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6323; and</P>
                <P>(ii) In any case in which 90 days or more prior to the date the refiling of the notice of lien under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is completed, the Bureau receives written information (in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, if a notice of such lien is also filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f)(1)(A)(ii) in the State in which such new residence is located (or, if such new residence is located in the District of Columbia or outside the United States, in the District of Columbia).</P>
                <FP>A notice of lien is considered as refiled in the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6323 if it is refiled in the office which, pursuant to a change in the applicable local law, assumed the functions of the office in which the prior notice or refiled notice was filed. If on or before the 90th day referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, more than one written notice is received concerning a change in the taxpayer's residence, a notice of lien is required by this subdivision to be filed only with respect to the residence shown on the written notice received on the most recent date. Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is applicable regardless of whether the taxpayer resides at the new residence on the date the refiling of notice of lien under paragraph (b)(l)(i) of this section is completed.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of change of taxpayer's residence</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> For purposes of this section, a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence will be effective only if it:</P>
                <P>(A) Is received, in writing, from the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative by the appropriate TTB officer who filed the original notice of lien.</P>
                <P>(B) Relates to an unpaid tax liability of the taxpayer, and</P>
                <P>(C) States the taxpayer's name and the address of the taxpayer's new residence.</P>

                <FP>Although it is not necessary that a written notice contain the taxpayer's identifying number authorized by section 6109, it is preferable that it include such number. A return or amended return filed by the taxpayer with the Bureau which on its face indicates that <PRTPAGE P="287"/>there is a change in the taxpayer's address and correctly states the taxpayer's name, the address of the taxpayer's new residence, and the taxpayer's identifying number required by 26 U.S.C. 6109 is sufficient notice under this paragraph.</FP>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Other rules applicable.</E> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, no communication (either written or oral) to the Bureau will be considered effective as notice of a change of a taxpayer's residence under this section, whether or not the Bureau has actual notice or knowledge of the taxpayer's new residence. For the purpose of determining the date on which a notice of change of a taxpayer's residence is received under this section, the notice shall be treated as received on the date it is actually received by the Bureau without reference to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7502.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Required refiling period.</E> For the purpose of this section, the term “required refiling period” means:</P>

                <P>(2) The 1-year period ending with the expiration of 6 years after the close of the preceding required refiling period for such notice of lien.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Release of lien or discharge of property.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Release of lien.</E> An appropriate TTB officer is charged with releasing liens or discharging property from liens. The appropriate TTB officer must issue a certificate of release of a lien imposed with respect to any tax imposed by a provision of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau, not later than 30 days after the day on which either:</P>
                <P>(1) The appropriate TTB officer finds that the entire liability for the tax has been satisfied or has become unenforceable as a matter of law (and not merely uncollectible or unenforceable as a matter of fact). Tax liabilities frequently are unenforceable in fact for the time being, due to the temporary nonpossession by the taxpayer of discoverable property or property rights. In all cases the liability for the payment of the tax continues until satisfaction of the tax in full or until the expiration of the statutory period for collection, including such extension of the period for collection as may be agreed upon in writing by the taxpayer and the appropriate TTB officer.</P>
                <P>(2) The appropriate TTB officer is furnished and accepts a bond that is conditioned upon the payment of the amount assessed (together with all interest in respect thereof and any expenses to which the Government has been put in the matter), within the time agreed upon in the bond, but not later than 6 months before the expiration of the statutory period for collection, including any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the appropriate TTB officer and the taxpayer. For provisions relating to bonds, see 26 U.S.C. 7101 and 7102 and §§ 70.281 and 70.282 of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Discharge of specific property from the lien</E>—(1) <E T="03">Property double the amount of the liability.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 if the Bureau determines that the fair market value of that part of the property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the sum of the amount of the unsatisfied liability secured by the lien and of the amount of all other liens upon the property which have priority over the lien. In general, fair market value is that amount which one ready and willing but not compelled to buy would pay to another ready and willing but not compelled to sell the property.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Part payment; interest of United States valueless</E>—(<E T="03">i</E>) <E T="03">Part payment.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 if there is paid over to the Bureau in partial satisfaction of the liability secured by the lien an amount determined by the Bureau to be not less than the value of the interest of the United States in the property to be so discharged. In determining the amount to be paid, the appropriate TTB officer will take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the expenses to which the Government has been put in <PRTPAGE P="288"/>the matter. In no case shall the amount to be paid be less than the value of the interest of the United States in the property with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be issued.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Interest of the United States valueless.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that official's discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to the lien if the Bureau determines that the interest of the United States in the property to be so discharged has no value.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Valuation of interest of United States.</E> For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), in determining the value of the interest of the United States in the property, or any part thereof, with respect to which the certificate of discharge is to be issued, the appropriate TTB officer shall give consideration to the value of the property and the amount of all liens and encumbrances thereon having priority over the Federal tax lien. In determining the value of the property, the appropriate TTB officer may, in that official's discretion, give consideration to the forced sale value of the property in appropriate cases.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Discharge of property by substitution of proceeds of sale.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of discharge of any part of the property subject to a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 if such part of the property is sold and, pursuant to a written agreement with the appropriate TTB officer, the proceeds of the sale are held, as a fund subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the lien or claim had with respect to the discharged property. This subparagraph does not apply unless the sale divests the taxpayer of all right, title, and interest in the property sought to be discharged. Any reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the property and the administration of the sale proceeds shall be paid by the applicant or from the proceeds of the sale before satisfaction of any lien or claim of the United States.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Application for certificate of discharge.</E> Any person desiring a certificate of discharge under this paragraph shall submit an application in writing to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall contain such information as the appropriate TTB officer may require.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Subordination of lien</E>—(1) <E T="03">By payment of the amount subordinated.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 upon any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the appropriate TTB officer an amount equal to the amount of the lien or interest to which the certificate subordinates the lien of the United States. For this purpose, the tax lien may be subordinated to another lien or interest on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, if a notice of a Federal tax lien is filed and a delinquent taxpayer secures a mortgage loan on a part of the property subject to the tax lien and pays over the proceeds of the loan to the appropriate TTB officer after an application for a certificate of subordination is approved, the appropriate TTB officer will issue a certificate of subordination. This certificate will have the effect of subordinating the tax lien to the mortgage.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">To facilitate tax collection.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, issue a certificate of subordination of a lien imposed under 26 U.S.C. 64 upon any part of the property subject to the lien if the appropriate TTB officer believes that the subordination of the lien will ultimately result in an increase in the amount realized by the United States from the property subject to lien and will facilitate the ultimate collection of the tax liability.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Application for certificate of subordination.</E> Any person desiring a certificate of subordination under this paragraph shall submit an application therefor in writing to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall contain such information as the appropriate TTB officer may require.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Nonattachment of lien.</E> If the appropriate TTB officer determines that, because of confusion of names or otherwise, any person (other than the person against whom the tax was assessed) is or may be injured by the appearance <PRTPAGE P="289"/>that a notice of lien filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part refers to such person, the appropriate TTB officer may issue a certificate of nonattachment. Such certificate shall state that the lien, notice of which has been filed, does not attach to the property of such person. Any person desiring a certificate of nonattachment under this paragraph shall submit an application therefor in writing to the appropriate TTB officer. The application shall contain such information as the appropriate TTB officer may require.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Effect of certificate</E>—(1) <E T="03">Conclusiveness.</E> Except as provided in paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section, if a certificate is issued under 26 U.S.C. 6325 by the appropriate TTB officer and the certificate is filed in the same office as the notice of lien to which it relates (if the notice of lien has been filed), the certificate shall have the following effect:</P>
                <P>(i) In the case of a certificate of release issued under paragraph (a) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the tax lien referred to in the certificate is extinguished;</P>
                <P>(ii) In the case of a certificate of discharge issued under paragraph (b) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the property covered by the certificate is discharged from the tax lien;</P>
                <P>(iii) In the case of a certificate of subordination issued under paragraph (c) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the lien or interest to which the Federal tax lien is subordinated is superior to the tax lien; and</P>
                <P>(iv) In the case of a certificate of nonattachment issued under paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate shall be conclusive that the lien of the United States does not attach to the property of the person referred to in the certificate.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Revocation of certificate of release or nonattachment</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> If the appropriate TTB officer determines that either:</P>
                <P>(A) A certificate of release or a certificate of nonattachment of the general tax lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 was issued erroneously or improvidently, or</P>
                <P>(B) A certificate of release of such lien was issued in connection with a compromise agreement under 26 U.S.C. 7122 which has been breached,and if the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability has not expired, the appropriate TTB officer may revoke the certificate and reinstate the tax lien.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Method of revocation and reinstatement.</E> The revocation and reinstatement described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section is accomplished by:</P>
                <P>(A) Mailing notice of the revocation to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address, and</P>
                <P>(B) Filing notice of the revocation of the certificate in the same office in which the notice of lien to which it relates was filed (if the notice of lien has been filed).</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Effect of reinstatement</E>—(A) <E T="03">Effective date.</E> A tax lien reinstated in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) is effective on and after the date the notice of revocation is mailed to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, but the reinstated lien is not effective before the filing of notice of revocation, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, if the filing is required by reason of the fact that a notice of the lien had been filed.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Treatment of reinstated lien.</E> As of the effective date of reinstatement, a reinstated lien has the same force and effect as a general tax lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 which arises upon assessment of a tax liability. The reinstated lien continues in existence until the liability is satisfied or until the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment of the tax liability to which it relates. The reinstatement of the lien does not retroactively reinstate a previously filed notice of lien. The reinstated lien is not valid against any holder of a lien or interest described in § 70.145 of this part until notice of the reinstated lien has been filed in accordance with the provisions of § 70.148 of this part subsequent to or concurrent with the time the reinstated lien became effective.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Certificates void under certain conditions.</E> Notwithstanding any other provisions of 26 U.S.C. subtitle F, any lien for Federal taxes attaches to any property with respect to which a certificate <PRTPAGE P="290"/>of discharge has been issued if the person liable for the tax reacquires the property after the certificate has been issued. Thus, if property subject to a Federal tax lien is discharged therefrom and is later reacquired by the delinquent taxpayer at a time when the lien is still in existence, the tax lien attaches to the reacquired property and is enforceable against it as in the case of after-acquired property generally.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Filing of certificates and notices.</E> If a certificate or notice described in this section may not be filed in the office designated by State law in which the notice of lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 (to which the certificate or notice relates) is filed, the certificate or notice is effective if filed in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the State office where the notice of lien is filed is situated.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Any person may appeal to the officer who filed the Federal tax lien on the property or rights to property of such person for a release of lien alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien. Such appeal may be used only for the purpose of correcting the erroneous filing of a notice of lien, not to challenge the underlying tax liability that led to the imposition of a lien.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Certificate of Release.</E> If the officer who filed the lien determines that the filing of the notice of any lien was erroneous that officer shall expeditiously, and to the extent practicable, within 14 days after such determination, issue a certificate of release of lien. The certificate of release of such lien shall include a statement that the filing of notice of lien was erroneous.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Appeal alleging an error in the filing of notice of lien.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an appeal of the filing of notice of Federal tax lien must be based on any one of the following allegations:</P>
                <P>(1) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien, plus any interest and additions to tax associated with said liability, was satisfied prior to the filing of notice of lien;</P>
                <P>(2) The tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in violation of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code); or</P>
                <P>(3) The statutory period for collection of the tax liability that gave rise to the lien expired prior to the filing of notice of Federal tax lien.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Notice of Federal tax lien that lists multiple liabilities.</E> When a notice of Federal tax lien lists multiple liabilities, a person may appeal the filing of notice of lien with respect to one or more of the liabilities listed in the notice, if the notice was erroneously filed with respect to such liabilities. If a notice of Federal tax lien was erroneously filed with respect to one or more liabilities listed in the notice, the officer who filed the Federal tax lien shall issue a certificate of release with respect to such liabilities.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedures for appeal</E>—(1) <E T="03">Manner.</E> An appeal of the filing of notice of Federal tax lien shall be made in writing to the officer who filed the lien.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Form.</E> The appeal shall include the following information and documents:</P>
                <P>(i) Name, current address, and taxpayer identification number of the person appealing the filing of notice of Federal tax lien;</P>
                <P>(ii) A copy of the notice of Federal tax lien affecting the property, if available; and</P>
                <P>(iii) The grounds upon which the filing of notice of Federal tax lien is being appealed.</P>
                <P>(A) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed is that the tax liability in question was satisfied prior to the filing, proof of full payment as defined in paragraph (f) of this section must be provided.</P>

                <P>(B) If the ground upon which the filing of notice is being appealed is that the tax liability that gave rise to the lien was assessed in violation of title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code), the appealing party must provide the identity of the court, the district in which the bankruptcy petition was filed, a docket number and the <PRTPAGE P="291"/>date of filing of the bankruptcy petition.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Time.</E> An administrative appeal of the erroneous filing of notice of Federal tax lien shall be made within 1 year after the taxpayer becomes aware of the erroneously filed tax lien.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Proof of full payment.</E> As used in paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the term “proof of full payment” means:</P>

                <P>(2) A cancelled check payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in an amount which was sufficient to satisfy the tax liability for which release is being sought; or</P>
                <P>(3) Any other manner of proof acceptable to the officer who filed the lien.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Exception.</E> Whenever necessary to protect the interests of the government, an appropriate TTB officer other than the officer who filed the lien, may receive and act on an administrative appeal of a lien in accordance with this section.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Levy and distraint.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority to levy</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the tax within 10 days after notice and demand, the appropriate TTB officer who initiated the assessment may proceed to collect the tax by levy, provided the taxpayer has been furnished the notice described in § 70.162(a) of this part. The appropriate TTB officer may levy upon any property, or rights to property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible, belonging to the taxpayer. The appropriate TTB officer may also levy upon property with respect to which there is a lien provided by 26 U.S.C. 6321 for the payment of the tax. For exemption of certain property from levy, see 26 U.S.C. 6334 and §§ 70.241 through 70.245 of this part. For exemption of certain property from levy, see 26 U.S.C. 6334 and §§ 70.241 through 70.245 of this part. As used in 26 U.S.C. 6331 and this section, the term “tax” includes any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with costs and expenses. Property subject to a Federal tax lien which has been sold or otherwise transferred by the taxpayer may be seized while in the hands of the transferee or any subsequent transferee. However, see 26 U.S.C. 6323(i)(2) and § 70.144 of this part concerning the subrogation rights of certain transferees. Levy may be made by serving a Notice of Levy on any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy, including receivables, bank accounts, evidences of debt, securities, and salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation. Except as provided in § 70.162(c) of this part with regard to a levy on salary or wages, a levy extends only to property possessed and obligations which exist at the time of the levy. Obligations exist when the liability of the obligor is fixed and determinable although the right to receive payment thereof may be deferred until a later date. For example, if on the first day of the month a delinquent taxpayer sold personal property subject to an agreement that the buyer remit the purchase price on the last day of the month, a levy made on the buyer on the 10th day of the month would reach the amount due on the sale, although the buyer need not satisfy the levy by paying over the amount to the appropriate TTB officer until the last day of the month. Similarly, a levy only reaches property in the possession of the person levied upon at the time the levy is made. For example, a levy made on a bank with respect to the account of a delinquent taxpayer is satisfied if the bank surrenders the amount of the taxpayer's balance at the time the levy is made, including interest thereon to the date of surrender. The levy has no effect upon any subsequent deposit made in the bank by the taxpayer. Subsequent deposits may be reached only by a subsequent levy on the bank.<PRTPAGE P="292"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Jeopardy cases.</E> If the appropriate TTB officer finds that the collection of any tax is in jeopardy, that officer may make notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax and, upon failure or refusal to pay such tax, collection thereof by levy shall be lawful without regard to the 10-day period provided in 26 U.S.C. 6331(a) or the 30-day period provided in 26 U.S.C. 6331(d).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Bankruptcy or receivership cases.</E> During a bankruptcy proceeding or a receivership proceeding in either a Federal or a State court, the assets of the taxpayer are in general under the control of the court in which such proceeding is pending. Taxes cannot be collected by levy upon assets in the custody of a court, whether or not such custody is incident to a bankruptcy or receivership proceeding, except where the proceeding has progressed to such a point that the levy would not interfere with the work of the court or where the court grants permission to levy. Any assets which under applicable provisions of law are not under the control of the court may be levied upon, for example, property exempt from court custody under State law or the bankrupt's earnings and property acquired after the date of bankruptcy. However, levy upon such property is not mandatory and the Government may rely upon payment of taxes in the proceeding.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Certain types of compensation</E>—(i) <E T="03">Federal employees.</E> Levy may be made upon the salary or wages of any officer or employee (including members of the Armed Forces), or elected or appointed official, of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of either, by serving a notice of levy on the employer of the delinquent taxpayer. As used in this paragraph, the term “employer” means:</P>
                <P>(A) The officer or employee of the United States, the District of Columbia, or of the agency or instrumentality of the United States or the District of Columbia, who has control of the payment of the wages, or</P>
                <P>(B) Any other officer or employee designated by the head of the branch, department, or agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of the District of Columbia as the party upon whom service of the notice of levy may be made.</P>
                <FP>If the head of such branch, department, agency or instrumentality designates an officer or employee other than one who has control of the payment of the wages, as the party upon whom service of the notice of levy may be made, such head shall promptly notify the appropriate TTB officer of the name and address of each officer or employee so designated and the scope or extent of the authority of such designee.</FP>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">State and municipal employees.</E> Salaries, wages, or other compensation of any officer, employee, or elected or appointed official of a State or Territory, or of any agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof, are also subject to levy to enforce collection of any Federal tax.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Seamen.</E> Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of the Seamen's Act of 1915 (46 U.S.C. 601), wages of seamen, apprentice seamen, or fishermen employed on fishing vessels are subject to levy. See 26 U.S.C. 6334(c).</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Noncompetent Indians.</E> Solely for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 6321 and 6331, any interest in restricted land held in trust by the United States for an individual noncompetent Indian (and not for a tribe) shall not be deemed to be property, or a right to property, belonging to such Indian.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Successive seizures.</E> Whenever any property or rights to property upon which a levy has been made are not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the United States for which the levy is made, the appropriate TTB officer may thereafter, and as often as may be necessary, proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property or rights to property subject to levy of the person against whom such claim exists or on which there is a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 (or the corresponding provision of prior law) for the payment of such claim until the amount due from such person, together with all costs and expenses, is fully paid.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Service of notice of levy by mail.</E> A notice of levy may be served by mailing the notice to the person upon whom the service of a notice of levy is authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In such a case the date and time the notice is delivered to the <PRTPAGE P="293"/>person to be served is the date and time the levy is made. If the notice is sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, the date of delivery on the receipt is treated as the date the levy is made. If, after receipt of a notice of levy, an officer or other person authorized to act on behalf of the person served signs and notes the date and time of receipt on the notice of levy, the date and time so noted will be presumed to be, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the date and time of delivery. Any person may upon written notice to the appropriate TTB officer, have all notices of levy by mail sent to one designated ofice. After such a notice is received by the appropriate TTB officer, notices of levy by mail will sent to the designated office until a written notice withdrawing the request or a written notice designating a difference office is received by the appropriate TTB officer.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Notice of intent to levy.</E> Levy may be made for any unpaid tax only after the appropriate TTB officer has notified the taxpayer in writing of the intent to levy. The notice must be given in person, left at the dwelling or usual place of business of the taxpayer, or be sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer's last known address, no less than 30 days before the day of levy. The notice of intent to levy is in addition to, and may be given at the same time as, the notice and demand described in § 70.161 of this part.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Jeopardy.</E> Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a levy if the appropriate TTB officer has made a finding under § 70.161(a)(2) of this part that the collection of tax is in jeopardy.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Continuing effect of levy on salary or wages.</E> A levy on salary or wages is continuous from the time of the levy until the liability out of which the levy arose is released under 26 U.S.C. 6343 and § 70.167 of this part. For this purpose, the term “salary or wages”includes compensation for services paid in the form of fees, commissions, bonuses, and similar items. The levy attaches to both salary or wages earned but not yet paid at the time of the levy, and salary or wages earned and becoming payable (or paid in the form of an advance) subsequent to the date of the levy, until the levy is released pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In general, salaries or wages that are the subject of a continuing levy, if not exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a) (8) or (9), become payable to the officer who made the levy as the payor would otherwise be obligated to pay over the money to the taxpayer. For example, if the wage earner is paid on the Wednesday following the close of each workweek, a levy made upon the taxpayer's employer on any Monday would reach both the wages due for the prior workweek and the wages for succeeding workweeks as such wages become payable. In such a case the levy would be satisfied if the employer, on the first Wednesday after the levy and on each Wednesday thereafter, pays over to the officer who made the levy wages which would otherwise be paid to the employee on such Wednesday, until the employer receives a notice of release from levy described in paragraph (d) of this section. See, however, § 70.245(d) of this part for rules which permit a delayed payment to the officer who made the levy in certain cases where amounts payable to the taxpayer are exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334 (a)(9) and (d).</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Release and notice of release from levy.</E> The officer who made the levy will promptly release a continuing levy on salary or wages when the conditions of 26 U.S.C. 6343 are met. The officer who made the levy will also promptly notify the person upon whom the levy was made that it has been released.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Property held by banks.</E> (i) Any bank shall surrender any deposits (including interest thereon) in such bank only after 21 days after service of levy.</P>
                <P>(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a levy has been made upon property or rights to property subject to levy which a bank engaged in the banking business in the United States or a possession of the United States is in possession of (or obligated with respect to), an appropriate TTB officer shall not enforce the levy with respect to any deposits held in an office of the bank outside the United States or a possession of the United States, unless the notice of levy specifies that such officer intends to reach such deposits. The notice of levy must not specify that such officer intends to reach such deposits unless that officer making such levy believes:</P>
                <P>(A) That the taxpayer is within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court at the time the levy is made and that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office of the bank outside the United States or a possession of the United States; or</P>
                <P>(B) That the taxpayer is not within the jurisdiction of a U.S. court a the time the levy is made, that the bank is in possession of (or obligated with respect to) deposits of the taxpayer in an office outside the United States or a possession of the United States, and that such deposits consist, in whole or in part, of funds transferred from the United States or a possession of the United States in order to hinder or delay the collection of a tax imposed by provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Enforcement of levy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Extent of personal liability.</E> Any person who, upon demand of the appropriate TTB officer, fails or refuses to surrender any property or right to property subject to levy is liable in his/her own person and estate in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights not so surrendered, together with costs and interests. The liability, however, may not exceed the amount of the taxes for the collection of which the levy was made. Interest is to be computed at the annual rate referred to in regulations under 26 U.S.C. 6221 from the date of the levy, or, in the case of a continuing levy on salary or wages (see 26 U.S.C. 6331(e)), from the date the person would otherwise have been obligated to pay over the wages or salary to the taxpayer. Any amount recovered, other than cost, will be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Penalty for violation.</E> In addition to the personal liability described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, any person who is required to surrender property or rights to property and who fails or refuses to surrender them without reasonable cause is liable for a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount recoverable under 26 U.S.C. 6332(d)(2). No part of the penalty described in this subparagraph shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made. The penalty described in this subparagraph is not applicable in cases where a bona fide dispute exists concerning the amount of the property to be surrendered pursuant to a levy or concerning the legal effectiveness of the levy. However, if a court in a later enforcement suit sustains the levy, then reasonable cause would usually not exist to refuse to honor a later levy made under similar circumstances.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of honoring levy.</E> Any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy and upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand by the appropriate TTB officer, surrenders the property or rights to property, or discharges the obligation, to that officer, or who pays a liability described in <PRTPAGE P="295"/>paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer with respect to the property or rights to property arising from the surrender or payment. If an insuring organization satisfies a levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract in accordance with § 70.164 of this part, the insuring organization is discharged from any obligation or liability to any beneficiaries of the contract arising from the surrender or payment. Also, it is discharged from any obligation or liability to the insured or other owner. Any person who mistakenly surrenders to the United States property or rights to property not properly subject to levy is not relieved from liability to a third party who owns the property. The owners of mistakenly surrendered property may, however, secure from the United States the administrative relief provided for in 26 U.S.C. 6343(b) or may bring suit to recover the property under 26 U.S.C. 7426.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Person defined.</E> In addition to the definition given in § 70.11 of this part, the term “person,” as used in 26 U.S.C.A 6332(a) and this section, includes an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property or to discharge the obligation. In the case of a levy upon the salary or wages of an officer, employee, or elected or appointed official of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of either, the term “person” includes the officer or employee of the United States, of the District of Columbia, or of such agency or instrumentality who is under a duty to discharge the obligation. As to the officer or employee who is under such duty, see § 70.161(a)(4)(i) of this part.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> This section provides special rules relating to the surrender of property subject to levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts. The provisions of § 70.163 of this part which relate generally to the surrender of property subject to levy apply, to the extent not inconsistent with the special rules set forth in this section, to a levy in the case of life insurance and endowment contracts.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Effect of service of notice of levy</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A notice of levy served by an appropriate TTB officer on an insuring organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by the organization shall constitute:</P>
                <P>(i) A demand by the officer who made the levy for the payment of the cash loan value of the contract adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and</P>
                <P>(ii) The exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is assessed to the advance of such cash loan value.</P>
                <FP>It is unnecessary for the official who made the levy to surrender the contract document to the insuring organization upon which the levy is made. However, the notice of levy will include a certification by the official who made the levy that a copy of the notice of levy has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is assessed at that person's last known address. At the time of service of the notice of levy, the levy is effective with respect to the cash loan value of the insurance contract, subject to the condition that if the levy is not satisfied or released before the 90th day after the date of service, the levy can be satisfied only by payment of the amount described in paragraph (c) of this section. Other than satisfaction or release of the levy, no event during the 90-day period subsequent to the date of service of the notice of levy shall release the cash loan value from the effect of the levy. For example, the termination of the policy by the taxpayer or by the death of the insured during such 90-day period shall not release the levy. For the rules relating to the time when the insuring organization is to pay over the required amount, see paragraph (c) of this section.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of amount subject to levy</E>—(i) <E T="03">Full payment before the 90th <PRTPAGE P="296"/>day.</E> In the event that the unpaid liability to which the levy relates is satisfied at any time during the 90-day period subsequent to the date of service of the notice of levy, the officer who filed the notice of levy will promptly give the insuring organization written notification that the levy is released.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Notification after the 90th day.</E> In the event that notification is not given under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the officer who filed the notice of levy will, promptly following the 90th day after service of the notice of levy, give the insuring organization written notification of the current status of all accounts listed on the notice of levy, and of the total payments received since service of the notice of levy. This notification will be given to the insuring organization whether or not there has been any change in the status of the accounts.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Satisfaction of levy.</E> The levy described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract shall be deemed to be satisfied if the insuring organization pays over to the officer who made the levy the amount which the person against whom the tax is assessed could have had advanced by the organization on the 90th day after service of the notice of levy on the organization. However, this amount is increased by the amount of any advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called a policy loan, made to the person on or after the date the orginzation has actual notice or knowledge, within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 6323(i)(1), of the existence of the tax lien with respect to which the levy is made. The insuring organization may, nevertheless, make an advance (including contractual interest thereon), generally called an automatic premium loan, made automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the organization has such actual notice or knowledge. In any event, the amount paid to the appropriate TTB officer by the insuring organization is not to exceed the amount of the unpaid liability shown on the notification described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The amount determined in accordance with the provisions of this section, subject to the levy, shall be paid to the appropriate TTB officer by the insuring organization promptly after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The satisfaction of a levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract will not discharge the contract from the tax lien. However, see 26 U.S.C. 6323(b)(9)(C) and § 70.231(i) of this part concerning the liability of an insurance company after satisfaction of a levy with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract. If the person against whom the tax is assessed so directs, the insuring organization, on a date before the 90th day after service of the notice of levy, may satisfy the levy by paying over an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph substituting such date for the 90th day. In the event of termination of the policy by the taxpayer or by the death of the insured on a date before the 90th day after service of the notice of levy, the amount to be paid over to the appropriate TTB officer by the insuring organization in satisfaction of the levy shall be an amount computed in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph substituting the date of termination of the policy or the date of death for the 90th day.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Other enforcement proceedings.</E> The satisfaction of the levy described in paragraph (b) of this section by an insuring organization shall be without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of any Federal tax lien with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract. Thus, this levy procedure is not the exclusive means of subjecting the life insurance and endowment contracts of the person against whom a tax is assessed to the collection of the person's unpaid assessment. The United States may choose to foreclose the tax lien in any case where it is appropriate, as, for example, to reach the cash surrender value (as distinguished from cash loan value) of a life insurance or endowment contract.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Release of levy</E>—(1) <E T="03">Authority.</E> An appropriate TTB officer may release the levy upon all or part of the property or rights to property levied upon as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (3) and (4) of this section. A levy may be released under paragraph (a)(3) of this section only if the delinquent taxpayer complies with such of the conditions thereunder as an appropriate TTB officer may require and if the appropriate TTB officer determines that such action will facilitate the collection of the liability.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Conditions for mandatory release.</E> (i) An appropriate TTB officer shall release the levy as authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if any of the following conditions exist:</P>
                <P>(A) The liability for which such levy was made is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time,</P>
                <P>(B) Release of such levy will facilitate the collection of such liability,</P>
                <P>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an agreement under 26 U.S.C. 6159 to satisfy such liability by means of installment payments, unless such agreement provides otherwise (an appropriate TTB officer is not required to release the levy in this case if release of such levy would jeopardize the secured creditor status of the United States).</P>
                <P>(D) An appropriate TTB officer has determined that such levy is creating an economic hardship due to the financial condition of the taxpayer, or</P>
                <P>(E) The fair market value of the property exceeds such liability and release of the levy on a part of such property could be made without hindering the collection of such liability.</P>
                <P>(ii) In the case of any tangible personal property essential in carrying on the trade or business of the taxpayer, the appropriate TTB officer shall provide for an expedited determination under paragraph (a)(2)(i) if levy on such tangible personal property would prevent the taxpayer from carrying on such trade or business.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Conditions for discretionary release.</E> An appropriate TTB officer may release the levy as authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if:</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Escrow arrangement.</E> The delinquent taxpayer offers a satisfactory arrangement, which is accepted by an appropriate TTB officer, for placing property in escrow to secure the payment of the liability (including the expenses of levy) which is the basis of the levy.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Bond.</E> The delinquent taxpayer delivers an acceptable bond to an appropriate TTB officer conditioned upon the payment of the liability (including the expenses of levy) which is the basis of the levy. Such bond shall be in the form provided in 26 U.S.C. 7101 and § 70.281 of this part.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Payment of amount of U.S. interest in the property.</E> There is paid to an appropriate TTB officer an amount determined by TTB to be equal to the interest of the United States in the seized property or the part of the seized property to be released.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Assignment of salaries and wages.</E> The delinquent taxpayer executes an agreement directing the taxpayer's employer to pay to an appropriate TTB officer amounts deducted from the employee's wages on a regular, continuing, or periodic basis, in such manner and in such amount as is agreed upon with an appropriate TTB officer, until the full amount of the liability is satisfied, and such agreement is accepted by the employer.</P>
                <P>(v) <E T="03">Extension of statute of limitations.</E> The delinquent taxpayer executes an agreement to extend the statute of limitations in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6502(a)(2) and § 70.224 of this part.<PRTPAGE P="298"/>
                </P>
                <P>(4) Release where value of interest of United States is insufficient to meet expenses of sale. An appropriate TTB officer may release the levy as authorized under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if that officer determines that the value of the interest of the United States in the seized property, or in the part of the seized property to be released is insufficient to cover the expenses of the sale of such property.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Return of property</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> If an appropriate TTB officer determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the appropriate TTB officer may return:</P>
                <P>(i) The specific property levied upon,</P>
                <P>(ii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon (together with interest thereon at the overpayment rate from the date TTB receives the money to a date not more than 30 days before the date of return), or</P>
                <P>(iii) An amount of money equal to the amount of money received by the United States from a sale of the property (together with interest thereon at the overpayment rate from the date of the sale of the property to a date not more than 30 days before the date of return).</P>
                <FP>If the United States is in possession of specific property, the property may be returned at any time. An amount equal to the amount of money levied upon or received from a sale of the property may be returned at any time before the expiration of 9 months from the date of the levy. When a request described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is filed for the return of property before the expiration of 9 months from the date of levy, an amount of money may be returned after a reasonable period of time subsequent to the expiration of the 9-month period if necessary for the investigation and processing of such request. In cases where money is specifically identifiable, as in the case of a coin collection which may be worth substantially more than its face value, the money will be treated as specific property and, whenever possible, this specific property will be returned. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, if property is declared purchased by the United States at a sale pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6335(e), the United States is treated as having received an amount of money equal to the minimum price determined by the appropriate TTB officer before the sale or, if larger, the amount received by the United States from the resale of the property.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Request for return of property.</E> A written request for the return of property wrongfully levied upon shall be addressed to the officer who authorized the levy. The written request shall contain the following information:</P>
                <P>(i) The name and address of the person submitting the request,</P>
                <P>(ii) A detailed description of the property levied upon,</P>
                <P>(iii) A description of the claimant's basis for claiming an interest in the property levied upon, and</P>
                <P>(iv) The name and address of the taxpayer, the originating TTB office, and the date of lien or levy as shown on the Notice of Tax Lien, Notice of Levy, or, in lieu thereof, a statement of the reasons why such information cannot be furnished.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Inadequate request.</E> A request shall not be considered adequate unless it is a written request containing the information required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. However, unless a notification is mailed by the officer who received the request to the claimant within 30 days of receipt of the request to inform the claimant of the inadequacies, any written request shall be considered adequate. If the officer who received the request timely notifies the claimant of the inadequacies of the request, the claimant shall have 30 days from the receipt of the notification of inadequacy to supply in writing any omitted information. Where the omitted information is so supplied within the 30-day period, the request shall be considered to be adequate from the time the original request was made for purposes of determining the applicable period of limitation upon suit under 26 U.S.C. 6532(c).</P>

In case real and personal property (or several tracts of real property) are purchased in the aggregate, the redemption price of the real property (or of each of the several tracts) shall be determined on the basis of the ratio, as of the time of sale, of the value of the real property (or tract) to the value of the total property purchased.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Notice of sale.</E> (1) As soon as practicable after seizure of the property, the appropriate TTB officer shall give notice of sale in writing to the owner. Such notice shall be delivered to the owner or left at the owner's usual place of abode or business if located. If the owner cannot be readily located, or has no dwelling or place of business, the notice may be mailed to the owner's last known address. The notice shall specify the property to be sold, and the time, place, manner, and conditions of the sale thereof, and shall expressly state that only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to such property is to be offered for sale. The notice shall also be published in some newspaper published in the county wherein the seizure is made or in a newspaper generally circulated in that county. For example, if a newspaper of general circulation in a county but not published in that county will reach more potential bidders for the property to be sold than a newspaper published within the county, or if there is a newspaper of general circulation within the county but no newspaper published within the county, the appropriate TTB officer may cause public notice of the sale to be given in the newspaper of general circulation within the county. If there is no newspaper published or generally circulated in the county, the notice shall be posted at the post office nearest the place where the seizure is made, and in not less than two other public places.</P>
                <P>(2) The appropriate TTB officer may use other methods of giving notice of sale and of advertising seized property in addition to those referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, when the appropriate TTB officer believes that the nature of the property to be sold is such that a wider or more specialized advertising coverage will enhance the possibility of obtaining a higher price for the property.</P>
                <P>(3) Whenever levy is made without regard to the 10-day period provided in 26 U.S.C. 6331(a) (relating to cases in which collection is in jeopardy), a public notice of sale of the property seized shall not be made within such 10-day period unless 26 U.S.C. 6336 (relating to perishable goods) is applicable.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Time, place, manner, and conditions of sale.</E> The time, place, manner, and conditions of sale of property seized by levy shall be as follows:<PRTPAGE P="301"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) <E T="03">Time and place of sale</E>—(i) <E T="03">In general.</E> The time of sale shall not be less than 10 days nor more than 40 days from the time of giving public notice under 26 U.S.C. 6335(b) (see paragraph (b) of this section). The place of sale shall be within the county in which the property is seized, except that if it appears to the appropriate TTB officer under whose supervision the seizure was made that substantially higher bids may be obtained for the property if the sale is held at a place outside such county, the appropriate TTB officer may order that the sale be held in such other place. The sale shall be held at the time and place stated in the notice of sale.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Right to request sale of seized property within 60 days.</E> The owner of any property seized by levy may request that the appropriate TTB officer sell such property within 60 days after such request (or within such longer period as may be specified by the owner). The appropriate TTB officer shall comply with such request unless it is determined (and the owner is notified within such period) that such compliance would not be in the best interests of the United States.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Adjournment of sale.</E> When it appears to the appropriate TTB officer that an adjournment of the sale will best serve the interest of the United States or that of the taxpayer, the appropriate TTB officer may adjourn the sale from time to time, but the date of the sale shall not be later than one month after the date fixed in the original notice of sale.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Minimum price.</E> (i) Before the sale of property seized by levy, the appropriate TTB officer shall determine:</P>
                <P>(A) A minimum price, taking into account the expenses of levy and sale, for which the property shall be sold, and</P>
                <P>(B) Whether the purchase of such property by the United States at such minimum price would be in the best interest of the United States.</P>
                <FP>If, at the sale, one or more persons offer to purchase such property for not less than the amount of the minimum price, the property shall be declared to be sold to the highest bidder. If no person offers for such property at the sale the amount of the minimum price and the appropriate TTB officer has determined that the purchase of such property by the United States would be in the best interest of the United States, the property shall be declared to be sold to the United States at such minimum price. If, at the sale, the property is not declared sold to the highest bidder or the United States, the property shall be released to the owner thereof and the expense of the levy and sale shall be added to the amount of tax for the collection of which the levy was made. Any property released to the owner under these circumstances shall remain subject to any lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. chapter 64, subchapter C.</FP>
                <P>(ii) The appropriate TTB officer conducting the sale shall either announce the minimum price before the sale begins or defer announcement of the minimum price until after the receipt of the highest bid, and, if the highest bid is greater than the minimum price, no announcement of the minimum price shall be made.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Offering of property</E>—(i) <E T="03">Sale of indivisible property.</E> If any property levied upon is not divisible, so as to enable the appropriate TTB officer by sale of a part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax and expenses of levy and sale, the whole of such property shall be sold. For application of surplus proceeds of sale, see 26 U.S.C. 6342(b).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Separately, in groups, or in the aggregate.</E> The seized property may be offered for sale:</P>
                <P>(A) As separate items, or</P>
                <P>(B) As groups of items, or</P>
                <P>(C) In the aggregate, or</P>
                <P>(D) Both as separate items (or in groups) and in the aggregate. In such cases, the property shall be sold under the method which produces the highest aggregate amount.</P>

                <FP>The appropriate TTB officer shall select whichever of the foregoing methods of offering the property for sale as is most feasible under all the facts and circumstances of the case, except that if the property to be sold includes both real and personal property, only the personal property may be grouped for the purpose of offering such property for sale. However, real and personal property may be offered for sale in the aggregate, provided the real property, as separate items, and the personal as <PRTPAGE P="302"/>a group, or as groups, or as separate items, are first offered separately.</FP>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Condition of title and of property.</E> Only the right, title, and interest of the delinquent taxpayer in and to the property seized shall be offered for sale, and such interest shall be offered subject to any prior outstanding mortgages, encumbrances, or other liens in favor of third parties which are valid as against the delinquent taxpayer and are superior to the lien of the United States. All seized property shall be offered for sale “as is” and “where is” and without recourse against the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, shall be made by the appropriate TTB officer offering the property for sale, as to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. No claim shall be considered for allowance or adjustment or for rescission of the sale based upon failure of the property to conform with any representation, express or implied.</P>
                <P>(iv) <E T="03">Terms of payment.</E> The property shall be offered for sale upon whichever of the following terms is fixed by the appropriate TTB officer in the public notice of sale:</P>
                <P>(A) Payment in full upon acceptance of the highest bid, without regard to the amount of such bid, or</P>
                <P>(B) If the aggregate price of all property purchased by a successful bidder at the sale is more than $200, an initial payment of $200 or 20 percent of the purchase price, whichever is the greater, and payment of the balance (including all costs incurred for the protection or preservation of the property subsequent to the sale and prior to final payment) within a specified period, not to exceed 1 month from the date of the sale.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Method of sale.</E> The appropriate TTB officer shall sell the property either:</P>
                <P>(i) At public auction, at which open competitive bids shall be received, or</P>
                <P>(ii) At public sale under sealed bids. The following rules, in addition to the other rules provided in this paragraph, shall be applicable to public sale under sealed bids:</P>
                <P>(A) <E T="03">Invitation to bidders.</E> Bids shall be solicited through a public notice of sale.</P>
                <P>(B) <E T="03">Form for use by bidders.</E> A bid shall be submitted on a form which will be furnished by the appropriate TTB officer upon request. The form shall be completed in accordance with the instructions thereon.</P>
                <P>(C) <E T="03">Remittance with bid.</E> If the total bid is $200 or less, the full amount of the bid shall be submitted therewith. If the total bid is more than $200, 20 percent of such bid or $200, whichever is greater, shall be submitted therewith. (In the case of alternative bids submitted by the same bidder for items of property offered separately, or groups, or in the aggregate, the bidder shall remit the full amount of the highest alternative bid submitted, if the bid is $200 or less. If the highest alternative bid submitted is more than $200, the bidder shall remit 20 percent of the highest alternative bid or $200, whichever is greater.) Such remittance shall be by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.</P>
                <P>(D) <E T="03">Time for receiving and opening bids.</E> Each bid shall be submitted in a securely sealed envelope. The bidder shall indicate in the upper left hand corner of the envelope the bidder's name and address and the time and place of sale as announced in the public notice of sale. A bid will not be considered unless it is received by the officer conducting the sale prior to the opening of the bids. The bids will be opened at the time and place stated in the notice or sale, or at the time fixed in the announcement of the adjournment of the sale.</P>
                <P>(E) <E T="03">Consideration of bids.</E> The public notice of sale shall specify whether the property is to be sold separately, by groups, or in the aggregate or by a combination of these methods, as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section. If the notice specifies an alternative method, bidders may submit <PRTPAGE P="303"/>bids under one or more of the alternatives. In case of error in the extension of prices in any bid, the unit price will govern. The officer conducting the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid. In the event two or more highest bids are equal in amount, the officer conducting the sale shall determine the successful bidder by drawing lots. After the opening, examination, and consideration of all bids, the officer conducting the sale shall announce the amount of the highest bid or bids and the name of the successful bidder or bidders. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned at the conclusion of the sale.</P>
                <P>(F) <E T="03">Withdrawal of bids.</E> A bid may be withdrawn on written or telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for opening the bids. A technical defect in a bid confers no right on the bidder for the withdrawal of his bid after it has been opened.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Payment of bid price.</E> All payments for property sold under this section shall be made by cash or by a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States, or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order. If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the highest bid, the payment shall be made at such time. If deferred payment is permitted, the initial payment shall be made upon acceptance of the bid, and the balance shall be paid on or before the date fixed for payment thereof. Any remittance submitted with a successful sealed bid shall be applied toward the purchase price.</P>
                <P>(7) <E T="03">Delivery and removal of personal property.</E> Responsibility of the United States for the protection or preservation of seized personal property shall cease immediately upon acceptance of the highest bid. The risk of loss is on the purchaser of personal property upon acceptance of his bid. Possession of any personal property shall not be delivered to the purchaser until the purchase price has been paid in full. If payment of part of the purchase price for personal property is deferred, the United States will retain possession of such property as security for the payment of the balance of the purchase price and, as agent for the purchaser, will cause the property to be cared for until the purchase price has been paid in full or the sale is declared null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price. In such case, all charges and expenses incurred in caring for the property after the acceptance of the bid shall be borne by the purchaser.</P>
                <P>(8) <E T="03">Default in payment.</E> If payment in full is required upon acceptance of the bid and is not then and there paid, the officer conducting the sale shall forthwith proceed again to sell the property in the manner provided in 26 U.S.C. 6335(e) and this section. If the conditions of the sale permit part of the payment to be deferred, and if such part is not paid within the prescribed period, suit may be instituted against the purchaser for the purchase price or such part thereof as has not been paid, together with interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the sale; or, in the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, the sale may be declared by the appropriate TTB officer to be null and void for failure to make full payment of the purchase price and the property may again be advertised and sold as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6335(b), (c), and (e) and this section. In the event of such readvertisement and sale, any new purchaser shall receive such property or rights to property free and clear of any claim or right of the former defaulting purchaser, of any nature whatsover, and the amount paid upon the bid price by such defaulting purchaser shall be forfeited to the United States.</P>

                <P>(v) <E T="03">Consideration of bids.</E> The officer conducting the sale shall have the right to waive any technical defects in a bid.

In the event the highest bids are equal in amount (and unless in the opinion of the officer conducting the sale a higher price can be obtained for the property than has been bid), the officer shall determine the successful bidder by drawing lots. Any remittance submitted in connection with an unsuccessful bid shall be returned to the bidder at the conclusion of the sale.</P>
                <P>(vi) <E T="03">Withdrawal of bid.</E> A bid may be withdrawn on written or telegraphic request received from the bidder prior to the time fixed for opening the bids.

If property is declared purchased by the United States under 26 U.S.C. 6335, then, for the purpose of this paragraph, the date of such declaration shall be deemed to be the date of acquisition of such real estate.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Accounting.</E> The appropriate TTB officer shall, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 7809, account for the proceeds of all sales or leases of the property and all expenses connected with the maintenance, sale, or lease of the property.</P>

In such case, such officer will notify in writing the appropriate TTB officer from whom he or she is taking charge and assuming responsibility.

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> A tax lien of the United States, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States, may be discharged or divested under local law only in the manner prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 2410 or in the manner prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7425. Title 26 U.S.C. 7425(a) contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien when the United States is not joined as a party in the judicial proceedings described in subsection (a) of 28 U.S.C. 2410. These judicial proceedings are plenary in nature and proceed on formal pleadings. Title 26 U.S.C. 7425(b) contains provisions relating to the discharge of a lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a lien in the event of a nonjudicial sale with respect to the property involved. Title 26 U.S.C. 7425(c) contains special rules relating to the notice of sale requirements contained in 26 U.S.C. 7425(b).<PRTPAGE P="312"/>

If the United States is improperly named as a party to a judicial proceeding, the effect is the same as if the United States were not joined.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Notice of lien filed when the proceeding is commenced.</E> Where the United States is not properly joined as a party in the court proceeding and a notice of lien has been filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) or (g) in the place provided by law for such filing at the time the action or suit is commenced, a judgment or judicial sale pursuant to such a judgment shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien of the United States.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Notice of lien not filed when the proceeding is commenced.</E> Where the United States is not joined as a party in the court proceeding and either a notice of lien has not been filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) or (g) in the palce provided by law for such filing at the time the action or suit is commenced, or the law makes no provision for that filing, a judgment or judicial sale pursuant to such a judgment shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien of the United States as may be provided with respect to these matters by the local law of the place where the property is situated.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Proceeds of a judicial sale.</E> If a judicial sale of property pursuant to a judgment in any civil action or suit to which the United States is not a party discharges a lien of the United States arising under the provisions of 26 U.S.C., the United States may claim the proceeds of the sale (exclusive of costs) prior to the time that distribution of the proceeds is ordered. The claim of the United States in such a case is treated as having the same priority with respect to the proceeds as the lien had with respect to the property which was discharged from the lien by the judicial sale.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7425(b) contains provisions with respect to the effect on the interest of the United States in property in which the United States has or claims a lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a lien, of a sale made pursuant to:</P>
                <P>(1) An instrument creating a lien on the property sold.</P>
                <P>(2) A confession of judgment on the obligation secured by an instrument creating a lien on the property sold, or</P>
                <P>(3) A statutory lien on the property sold.</P>

                <P>For purposes of this section, such a sale is referred to as a “nonjudicial sale.” The term “nonjudicial sale” includes, but is not limited to, the divestment of the taxpayer's interest in property which occurs by operation of law, by public or private sale, by forfeiture, or by termination under provisions contained in a contract for a deed or a conditional sales contract. Under 26 U.S.C. 7425(b)(1), if a notice of lien is filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6323(f) or (g), or the title derived from the enforcement of a lien is recorded as provided by local law, more than 30 days before the date of sale and the appropriate TTB officer is not given notice of the sale (in the manner prescribed in § 70.205 of this part), the sale shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien or title of the United States. Under 26 U.S.C. 7425(b)(2)(C), in any case in which notice of the sale is given to the appropriate TTB officer not less than 25 days prior to the date of sale (in the manner prescribed in 26 U.S.C. 7425(c)(1)), the sale shall have the same effect with respect to the discharge or divestment of the lien or title as may be provided by local law with respect to other junior liens or other titles derived from the enforcement of junior liens. A nonjudicial sale pursuant to a lien which is junior to a tax lien does not divest the tax lien, even though notice of the nonjudicial sale is given to the appropriate TTB officer. However, under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6325(b) and § 70.150 of <PRTPAGE P="313"/>this part, designated officers may discharge the property from a tax lien, including a tax lien which is senior to another lien upon the property.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Date of sale.</E> In the case of a nonjudicial sale subject to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7425(b), in order to compute any period of time determined with reference to the date of sale, the date of sale shall be determined in accordance with the following rules:</P>
                <P>(1) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting directly from a public sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date the public sale is held, regardless of the date under local law on which junior liens on the property are divested or the title to the property is transferred.</P>
                <P>(2) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property resulting directly from a private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date title to the property is transferred, regardless of the date junior liens on the property are divested under local law, and</P>
                <P>(3) In the case of divestment of junior liens on property not resulting directly from a public or private sale, the date of sale is deemed to be the date on which junior liens on the property are divested under local law. For provisions relating to the right of redemption of the United States, see 26 U.S.C. 7425(d) and § 70.206 of this part.</P>

The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time for performance of acts where the last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under this paragraph.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Postponement of scheduled sale</E>—(i) <E T="03">Where notice of sale is given.</E> In the event that notice of a sale is given in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, with respect to a scheduled sale which is postponed to a later time or date, the seller of the property is required to give notice of the postponement to the appropriate TTB officer, in the same manner as is required under local law with respect to other secured creditors. For example, assume that in State M local law requires that in the event of a postponement of a scheduled forclosure sale of real property, an oral announcement of the postponement at the place and time of the scheduled sale constitutes sufficient notice to secured creditors of the postponement. Accordingly, if at the place and time of a scheduled sale in State M an oral announcement of the postponement is made, the Bureau is considered to have notice of the postponement for the purpose of this paragraph (a)(2).</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Where noitce of sale is not given.</E> In the event that:</P>
                <P>(A) Notice of a nonjudicial sale would not be required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the sale were held on the originally scheduled date,</P>
                <P>(B) Because of a postponement of the scheduled sale, more than 30 days elapse between the originally scheduled date of the sale and the date of the sale, and</P>
                <P>(C) A notice of lien with respect to the property to be sold is filed more than 30 days before the date of the sale, notice of the sale is required to be given to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In any case in which notice of sale is required to be given with respect to a scheduled sale, and notice of the sale is not given, any postponement of the scheduled sale does not affect the rights of the United States under 26 U.S.C. 7425(b).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Consent to sale</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Notwithstanding the notice of sale provisions of paragraph (a) of this section a nonjudicial sale of property shall discharge or divest the property of the lien or title of the United States if the appropriate TTB officer consents to the sale of the property free of the lien or title. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 7425(c)(2), <PRTPAGE P="314"/>where adequate protection is afforded the lien or title of the United States, the appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, consent with respect to the sale of property in appropriate cases. Such consent shall be effective only if given in writing and shall be subject to such limitations and conditions as the appropriate TTB officer may require. However, the appropriate TTB officer may not consent to a sale of property under this section after the date of sale, as determined under § 70.204(b) of this part. For provisions relating to releasing a lien or discharging property subject to a tax lien, <E T="03">see</E> 26 U.S.C. 6325 and § 70.150 of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Application for consent.</E> Any person desiring the appropriate TTB officer's consent to sell property free of a tax lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien of the United States in the property shall submit to the appropriate TTB officer a written application, in triplicate, declaring that it is made under penalties of perjury, and requesting that such consent be given. The application shall contain the information required in the case of a noitice of sale, as set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and, in addition, shall contain a statement of the reasons why the consent is desired.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Sale of perishable goods</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> A notice (as described in paragraph (d) of this section) of a nonjudicial sale of perishable goods (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be given in writing, by registered or certified mail or delivered by personal service, at any time before the sale, to the appropriate TTB officer. If a notice of a nonjudicial sale is timely given in the manner described in this paragraph the nonjudicial sale shall discharge or divest the tax lien, or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, of the United States in the property. The provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7502 (relating to timely mailing treated as timely filing) and 7503 (relating to time for performance of acts where the last days falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday) apply in the case of notices required to be made under this paragraph. The seller of the perishable goods shall hold the proceeds (exclusive of costs) of the sale as a fund, for not less than 30 days after the date of the sale, subject to the liens and claims of the United States, in the same manner and with the same priority as the liens and claims of the United States had with respect to the property sold. If the seller fails to hold the proceeds of the sale in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and if the appropriate TTB officer asserts a claim to the proceeds within 30 days after the date of sale, the seller shall be personally liable to the United States for an amount equal to the value of the interest of the United States in the fund. However, even if the proceeds of the sale are not so held by the seller, but all the other provisions of this paragraph are satisfied, the buyer of the property at the sale takes the property free of the liens and claims of the United States. In the event of a postponement of the scheduled sale of perishable goods, the seller is not required to notify the appropriate TTB officer of the postponement. For provisions relating to releasing a lien or discharging property subject to a tax lien, see 26 U.S.C. 6325 and § 70.150 of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of perishable goods.</E> For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “perishable goods” means any tangible personal property which, in the reasonable view of the person selling the property, is liable to perish or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or cannot be kept without great expense.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Forfeiture of land sales contract.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a nonjudicial sale of property includes any forfeiture of a land sales contract.</P>

                <P>(ii) A copy of each Notice of Federal Tax Lien (TTB Form 5651.2) affecting the property to be sold, or the following information as shown on each such Notice of Federal Tax Lien:</P>

                <P>(iii) With respect to the property to be sold the following information:</P>
                <P>(A) A detailed description, including location of the property affected by the notice (in the case of real property, the street address, city, and State and the legal description contained in the title or deed to the property and, if available, a copy of the abstract of title),</P>
                <P>(B) The date, time, place, and terms of proposed sale of the property, and</P>
                <P>(C) In case of a sale of perishable property described in paragraph (c) of this section, a statement of the reasons why the property is believed to be perishable; and</P>
                <P>(iv) The approximate amount of the principal obligation, including interest, secured by the lien sought to be enforced and a description of the other expenses (such as legal expenses, selling costs, etc.) which may be charged against the sale proceeds.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Inadequate notice.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, a notice of sale described in paragraph (a) of this section which does not contain the information described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be considered inadequate by the appropriate TTB officer. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the notice is inadequate, that officer will give written notification of the items of information which are inadequate to the person who submitted the notice. A notice of sale which does not contain the name and address of the person submitting such notice shall be considered to be inadequate for all purposes without notification of any specific inadequacy. In any case where a notice of sale, does not contain the information required under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, the appropriate TTB officer may give written notification of such omission without specification of any other inadequacy and such notice of sale shall be considered inadequate for all purposes. In the event the appropriate TTB officer gives notification that the notice of sale is inadequate, a notice complying with the provisions of this section (including the requirement that the notice be given not less than 25 days prior to the sale in the case of a notice described in paragraph (a) of this section) must be given. However, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in such a case the appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, consent to the sale of the property free of the lien or title of the United States even though notice of the sale is given less than 25 days prior to the sale. In any case where the person who submitted a timely notice which indicates the person's name and address does not receive, more than 5 days prior to the date of the sale, written notification from the appropriate TTB officer that the notice is inadequate, the notice shall be considered adequate for purposes of this section.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Acknowledgment of notice.</E> If a notice of sale described in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section is submitted in duplicate to the appropriate TTB officer with a written request that receipt of the notice be acknowledged and returned to the person giving the notice, this request will be honored by the appropriate TTB officer. The acknowledgment by the appropriate TTB officer will indicate the date and time of the receipt of the notice.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Disclosure of adequacy of notice.</E> The appropriate TTB officer is authorized to disclose, to any person who has a proper interest, whether an adequate notice of sale was given under paragraph (d)(1) of tis section insofar as disclosure is authorized under 26 U.S.C. 6103. Any person desiring this information should submit to the appropriate TTB officer a written request which clearly describes the property sold or to be sold, identifies the applicable notice of lien, gives the reasons for requesting the information, and states the name and address of the person making the request.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Right to redeem</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In the case of a nonjudicial sale of real property to satisfy a lien prior to the <PRTPAGE P="316"/>tax lien or a title derived from the enforcement of a tax lien, the appropriate TTB officer may redeem the property within the redemption period (as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The right of redemption of the United States exists under 26 U.S.C. 7425(d) even though a consent to the sale has been made under 26 U.S.C. 7425(c)(2) and § 70.205(b) of this part. For purposes of this section, the term “nonjudicial sale” shall have the same meaning as used in § 70.204(a) of this part.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Redemption period.</E> For purposes of this section, the redemption period shall be:</P>
                <P>(i) The period beginning with the date of the sale (as determined under § 70.204(b)) and ending with the 120th day after such date, or</P>
                <P>(ii) The period for redemption of real property allowable with respect to other secured creditors, under the local law of the place where the real property is located, whichever expires later.</P>
                <FP>Which ever period is applicable, 26 U.S.C. 7425 and this section shall govern the amount to be paid and the procedure to be followed.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> In the event a sale does not ultimately discharge the property from tax lien (whether by reason of local law or the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 7425(b)), the provisions of this section do not apply because the tax lien will continue to attach to the property after the sale. In a case in which the Bureau is not entitled to a notice of sale under 26 U.S.C. 7425(b) and § 70.205 of this part, the United States does not have a right of redemption under 26 U.S.C. 7425(d). However, in such a case, if a tax lien has attached to the property at the time of sale, the United States has the same right of redemption, if any, which is afforded similar creditors under the local law of the place in which the property is situated.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Amount to be paid</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> In any case in which an appropriate TTB officer exercises the right to redeem real property under 26 U.S.C. 7425(d), the amount to be paid is the sum of the following amounts:</P>
                <P>(i) The actual amount paid for the property (as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) being redeemed (which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent legally satisfied by reason of the sale);</P>
                <P>(ii) Interest on the amount paid (described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) at the sale by the purchaser of the real property computed at the rate of 6 percent per annum for the period from the date of the sale (as determined under § 70.204(b) of this part) to the date of redemption;</P>
                <P>(iii) The amount, if any, equal to the excess of the expenses necessarily incurred to maintain such property (as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section) by the purchaser (and the purchaser's successor in interest, if any) over the income from such property realized by the purchaser (and the purchaser's successor in interest, if any) plus a reasonable rental value of such property (to the extent the property is used by or with the consent of the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest or is rented at less than its reasonable rental value); and</P>
                <P>(iv) The amounts, if any, of a payment made by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest after the foreclosure sale to a holder of a senior lien (to the extent provided under paragraph (b)(4) of this section).</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Actual amount paid.</E> (i) The actual amount paid for property by a purchaser, other than holder of the lien being foreclosed, is the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount paid by the purchaser at the sale includes deferred payments upon the bid price. The actual amount paid does not include costs and expenses incurred prior to the foreclosure sale by the purchaser except to the extent such expenses are included in the amount bid and paid for the property. For example, the actual amount paid does not normally include the expenses of the purchaser such as title searches, professional fees, or interest on debt incurred to obtain funds to purchase the property.</P>

                <P>(ii) In the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, the actual amount paid is the sum of:<PRTPAGE P="317"/>
                </P>
                <P>(A) The amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent legally satisfied by reason of the sale and</P>
                <P>(B) Any additional amount bid and paid at the sale.</P>
                <FP>For purposes of this section, a purchaser who acquires title as a result of a nonjudicial foreclosure sale is treated as the holder of the lien being foreclosed if a lien (or any interest reserved, created, or conveyed as security for the payment of a debt or fulfillment of other obligation) held by the purchaser is partially or fully satisfied by reason of the foreclosure sale. For example, a person whose title is derived from a tax deed issued under local law shall be treated as a purchaser who is the holder of the lien foreclosed in a case where a tax certificate, evidencing a lien on the property arising from the payment of property taxes, ripens into title. The amount paid by a purchaser at the sale includes deferred payments upon any portion of the bid price which is in excess of the amount of the lien being foreclosed. The actual amount paid does not include costs and expenses incurred prior to the foreclosure sale by the purchaser except to the extent such expenses are included in the amount of the lien being foreclosed which is legally satisfied by reason of the sale or in the amount bid and paid at the sale. Where the lien being foreclosed attaches to other property not subject to the foreclosure sale, the amount legally satisfied by reason of the sale does not include the amount of such lien that attaches to the other property. However, for purposes of the preceding sentences, the amount of the lien that attaches to the other property shall be considered to be equal to the amount by which the value of the other property exceeds the amount of any other senior lien on that property. Where, after the sale, the holder of the lien being foreclosed has the right to the unpaid balance of the amount due the holder, the amount legally satisfied by reason of the sale does not include the amount of such lien to the extent a deficiency judgment may be obtained therefor. However, for purposes of the preceding sentence, an amount, with respect to which the holder of the lien being foreclosed would otherwise have a right to a deficiency judgment, shall be considered to be legally satisfied by reason of the foreclosure sale to the extent that the holder has waived the holder's right to a deficiency judgment prior to the foreclosure sale. For this purpose, the waiver must be in writing and legally binding upon the foreclosing lienholder as of the time the sale is concluded. If, prior to the foreclosure, payments have been made by the foreclosing lienholder to a holder of a superior lien, the payments are included in the actual amount paid to the extent they give rise to an interest which is legally satisfied by reason of the foreclosure sale.</FP>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Excess expenses incurred by purchaser.</E> (i) Expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the property after the foreclosure sale and before redemption by the United States are taken into account in determining if there are excess expenses payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Expenses incurred by the purchaser prior to the foreclosure sale are not considered under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (See paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for circumstances under which such expenses may be included in the amount to be paid.) Expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the property include, for example, rental agent commissions, repair and maintenance expenses, utilities expenses, legal fees incurred after the foreclosure sale and prior to redemption in defending the title acquired through the foreclosure sale, and a proportionate amount of casualty insurance premiums and ad valorem taxes. Improvements made to the property are not considered as an expense unless the amounts incurred for such improvements are necessarily incurred to maintain the property.</P>

                <P>(ii) At any time prior to the expiration of the redemption period applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer may, by certified or registered mail or hand delivery, request a written itemized statement of the amount claimed by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest to be payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Unless the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest furnishes the <PRTPAGE P="318"/>written itemized statement within 15 days after the request is made by the appropriate TTB officer, it shall be presumed that no amount is payable for expenses in excess of income and the Bureau shall tender only the amount otherwise payable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest has failed to furnish the written itemized statement within 15 days after the request therefor is made by the appropriate TTB officer, or there is a disagreement as to the amount properly payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a payment for excess expenses shall be made after the redemption within a reasonable time following the verification by the appropriate TTB officer of a written itemized statement submitted by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest or the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount properly payable for excess expenses.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Payments made by purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest to a senior lienor.</E> (i) The amount to be paid upon a redemption by the United States shall include the amount of a payment made by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest to a holder of a senior lien to the extent a request for the reimbursement thereof (made in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) is approved as provided under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. This paragraph applies only to a payment made after the foreclosure sale and before the redemption to a holder of a lien that was, immediately prior to the foreclosure sale, superior to the lien foreclosed. A payment of principal or interest to a senior lienor shall be taken into account. Generally, the portion, if any, of a payment which is to be held in escrow for the payment of an expense, such as hazard insurance or real property taxes, is not considered under this paragraph. However, a payment by the escrow agent of a real property tax or special assessment lien, which was senior to the lien foreclosed, shall be considered to be a payment made by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest for purposes of this paragraph. With respect to real property taxes assessed after the foreclosure sale, see paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, relating to excess expenses incurred by the purchaser.</P>
                <P>(ii) Before the expiration of the redemption period applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer shall, in any case where a redemption is contemplated, send notice to the purchaser (or the purchaser's successor in interest of record) by certified or registered mail or hand delivery of the right under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to request reimbursement (payable in the event the right to redeem under 26 U.S.C. 7425(d) is exercised) for a payment made to a senior lienor. No later than 15 days after the notice from the appropriate TTB officer is sent, the request for reimbursement shall be mailed or delivered to the office specified in such notice and shall consist of:</P>
                <P>(A) A written itemized statement, signed by the claimant, of the amount claimed with respect to a payment made to a senior lienor, together with the supporting evidence requested in the notice from the appropriate TTB officer, and</P>
                <P>(B) A waiver or other document that will be effective upon redemption by the United States to discharge the property from, or transfer to the United States, any interest in or lien on the property that may arise under local law with respect to the payment made to a senior lienor.</P>

                <FP>Upon a showing of reasonable cause, an appropriate TTB officer may, in that official's discretion and at any time before the expiration of the applicable period for redemption, grant an extension for a reasonable period of time to submit, amend, or supplement a request for reimbursement. Unless a request for reimbursement is timely submitted (determined with regard to any extension of time granted), no amount shall be payable to the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest on account of a payment made to a senior lienor if the right to redeem under 26 U.S.C. 7425(d) is exercised. A waiver or other document submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section shall be treated as effective only to the extent of the amount included in the redemption price under this paragraph. If the right to redeem is not exercised or <PRTPAGE P="319"/>a request for reimbursement is withdrawn, the appropriate TTB officer shall, by certified or registered mail or hand delivery, return to the purchaser or the purchaser's successor any waiver or other document submitted pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section as soon as is practicable.</FP>
                <P>(iii) A request for reimbursement submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section shall be considered to be approved for the total amount claimed by the purchaser, and payable in the event the right to redeem is exercised, unless the appropriate TTB officer sends notice to the claimant, by certified or registered mail or hand delivery, of the denial of the amount claimed within 30 days after receipt of the request of 15 days before expiration of the applicable period for redemption, whichever is later. The notification of denial shall state the grounds for denial. If such notice of denial is given, the request for reimbursement for a payment made to a senior lienor shall be treated as having been withdrawn by the purchaser or the purchaser's successor and the Bureau shall tender only the amount otherwise payable under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If a request for reimbursement is treated as having been withdrawn under the preceding sentence, payment for amounts described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may, in the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, be made after the redemption upon the resolution of the disagreement as to the amount properly payable under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Certificate of redemption</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> If an appropriate TTB officer exercises the right of redemption of the United States described in paragraph (a) of this section, the appropriate TTB officer shall apply to the officer designated by local law, if any, for the documents necessary to evidence the fact of redemption and to record title to the redeemed property in the name of the United States. If no such officer has been designated by local law, or if the officer designated by local law fails to issue the necessary documents, the appropriate TTB officer is authorized to issue a certificate of redemption for the property redeemed by the United States.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Filing.</E> The appropriate TTB officer shall, without delay, cause either the documents issued by the local officer or the certificate of redemption executed by the appropriate TTB officer to be filed with the local office where certificates of redemption are generally filed. If a certificate of redemption is issued by the appropriate TTB officer and if the State in which the real property redeemed by the United States is situated has no office with which certificates of redemption may be filed, the appropriate TTB officer shall file the certificate of redemption in the office of the clerk of the United States district court for the judicial district in which the redeemed property is situated.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Effect of certificate of redemption.</E> A certificate of redemption executed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the regularity of the redemption. When a certificate of redemption is recorded, it shall transfer to the United States all the rights, title, and interest in and to the redeemed property acquired by the person, from whom the appropriate TTB officer redeemed the property, by virtue of the sale of the property. Therefore, if under local law the purchaser takes title free of liens junior to the lien of the foreclosing lienholder, the United States takes the title free of such junior liens upon redemption of the property. If a certificate of redemption has been erroneously prepared and filed because the redemption was not effective, the appropriate TTB officer shall issue a document revoking such certificate of redemption and such document shall be conclusively binding upon the United States against a purchaser of the property or a holder of a lien upon the property.</P>

                <P>(4) Application for release of right of redemption. Upon application of a party with a proper interest in the real property sold in a nonjudicial sale described in 26 U.S.C. 7425(b) and § 70.204 of this part, which real property is subject to the right of redemption of the United States described in this section, the appropriate TTB officer may, in that officer's discretion, release the <PRTPAGE P="320"/>right of redemption with respect to the property. The application for the release must be submitted in writing to an appropriate TTB officer and must contain such information as the appropriate TTB officer may require. If the appropriate TTB officer determines that the right of redemption of the United States is without value, no amount shall be required to be paid with respect to the release of the right of redemption.</P>

                <FP>No action is permitted under 26 U.S.C. 7426(a)(1) unless there has been a levy upon the property claimed.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Surplus proceeds.</E> If property has been sold pursuant to levy, any person (other than the person against whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States based upon the claim that the person:</P>
                <P>(i) Has an interest in or lien on such property junior to that of the United States; and</P>
                <P>(ii) Is entitled to the surplus proceeds of such sale.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Substituted sale proceeds.</E> Any person who claims to be legally entitled to all or any part of the amount which is held as a fund from the sale of property pursuant to an agreement described in 26 U.S.C. 6325(b)(3) may bring a civil action against the United States in a district court of the United States to obtain the relief provided by 26 U.S.C. 7426(b)(4). It is not necessary that the claimant be a party to the agreement which provides for the substitution of the sale proceeds for the property subject to the lien.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjudication</E>—(1) <E T="03">Wrongful levy.</E> If the court determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the court may:</P>
                <P>(i) Grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of such levy or to prohibit a sale of such property if such sale would irreparably injure rights in the property which are superior to the rights of the United States in such property; or</P>
                <P>(ii) Order the return of specific property if the United States is in possession of such property; or</P>
                <P>(iii) Grant a judgment for the amount of money levied upon, with interest thereon at the overpayment rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621 from the date that the officer who made the levy receives the money wrongfully levied upon to the date of payment of such judgment, or</P>
                <P>(iv) Grant a judgment for an amount not exceeding the amount received by the United States from the sale of such property (which, in the case of property declared purchased by the United States at a sale, shall be the greater of the minimum amount determined pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6335(e) or the amount received by the United States from the resale of such property), or the fair market value of such property immediately before the levy, with interest thereon at the overpayment rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621 from the date of the sale of the property to the date of payment of such judgment.</P>

                <FP>For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a levy is wrongful against a person (other than the taxpayer against whom the assessment giving rise to the levy is made), if the levy is upon property exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334, or the levy is upon property in which the taxpayer had no interest at the time the lien arose or thereafter, or the levy is upon property with respect to which such person is a purchaser against whom the lien is invalid under 26 U.S.C. 6323 or 6324(a)(2) or (b), or the levy or sale pursuant to <PRTPAGE P="321"/>levy will or does effectively destroy or otherwise irreparably injure such person's interest in the property which is senior to the Federal tax lien. A levy may be wrongful against a holder of a senior lien upon the taxpayer's property under certain circumstances although legal rights to enforce the holder's interest survive the levy procedure. For example, the levy may be wrongful against such a person if the property is an obligation which is collected pursuant to the levy rather than sold and nothing thereafter remains for the senior lienholder, or the property levied upon is of such a nature that when it is sold at a public sale the property subject to the senior lien is not available for the senior lienholder as a realistic source for the enforcement of the holder's interest. Some of the factors which should be taken into account in determining whether property remains or will remain a realistic source from which the senior lienholder may realize collection are: The nature of the property, the number of purchasers, the value of each unit sold or to be sold, whether, as a direct result of the distraint sale, the costs of realizing collection from the security have or will be so substantially increased as to render the security substantially valueless as a source of collection, and whether the property subject to the distraint sale constitutes substantially all of the property available as security for the payment of the indebtedness to the senior lienholder.</FP>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Surplus proceeds.</E> If the court determines that the interest or lien of any party to an action under 26 U.S.C. 7426 was transferred to the proceeds of a sale of the property, the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of the surplus proceeds of such sale. The term “surplus proceeds” means property remaining after application of the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6342(a).</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Substituted sale proceeds.</E> If the court determines that a party has an interest in or lien on the amount held as a fund pursuant to an agreement described in 26 U.S.C. 6325(b)(3), the court may grant a judgment in an amount equal to all or any part of the amount of such fund.</P>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension by agreement.</E> (i) The 10-year period of limitation on collection after assessment of any tax may, prior to the expiration thereof, be extended for any period of time agreed upon in writing by the taxpayer and the appropriate TTB officer.

An extension under this paragraph has the same effect as an agreement made prior to the expiration of the period of limitation on collection after assessment, and during the period of the extension collection may be enforced as to all property or rights to property owned by the taxpayer whether or not seized under the levy which was released.</P>

                <P>(3) A transferee of an interest protected under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section to the same extent the lien is invalid against the transferor to the transferee.

                <P>(b) <E T="03">Motor vehicles</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in § 70.143(f) of this part) of a motor vehicle (as defined in § 70.143(c) of this part) if:</P>
                <P>(i) At the time of purchase, the purchaser did not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the existence of the lien, and</P>

                <P>(ii) Before the purchaser obtains such notice or knowledge, the purchaser has acquired actual possession of the motor <PRTPAGE P="325"/>vehicle and has not thereafter relinquished actual possession to the seller or seller's agent.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Cross reference.</E> For provisions relating to additional circumstances in which the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 may not be valid against the purchaser of tangible personal property (including a motor vehicle) purchased at retail, see paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Personal property purchased at retail</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed (with respect to any tax imposed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau) in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in § 70.143(f) of this part) of tangible personal property purchased at a retail sale (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) unless at the time of purchase the purchaser intends the purchase to (or knows that the purchase will) hinder, evade, or defeat the collection of any tax imposed by the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of retail sale.</E> For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, the term “retail sale” means a sale, made in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business, of tangible personal property of which the seller is the owner. Such term includes a sale in customary retail quantities by a seller who is going out of business, but does not include a bulk sale or an auction sale in which goods are offered in quantities substantially greater than are customary in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business or an auction sale of goods the owner of which is not in the business of selling such goods.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Personal property purchased in casual sale</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a purchaser (as defined in § 70.143(f) of this part) of household goods, personal effects, or other tangible personal property of a type described in § 70.241 of this part (which includes wearing apparel, school books, fuel, provisions, furniture, arms for personal use, livestock, and poultry (whether or not the seller is the head of a family); and books and tools of a trade, business, or profession (whether or not the trade, business, or profession of the seller)), purchased, other than for resale, in a casual sale for less than $250 (excluding interest and expenses described in § 70.147 of this part). For purposes of this paragraph, a casual sale is a sale not made in the ordinary course of the seller's trade or business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> This paragraph applies only if the purchaser does not have actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part):</P>
                <P>(i) Of the existence of the tax lien, or</P>
                <P>(ii) That the sale is one of a series of sales.</P>
                <FP>For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, a sale is one of a series of sales if the seller plans to dispose of, in separate transactions, substantially all of the seller's household goods, personal effects, and other tangible personal property described in § 70.241 of this part.</FP>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Personal property subject to possessory liens.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a holder of a lien on tangible personal property which under local law secures the reasonable price of the repair or improvement of the property if the property is, and has been, continuously in the possession of the holder of the lien from the time the possessory lien arose. For example, if local law gives an automobile mechanic the right to retain possession of an automobile the mechanic has repaired as security for payment of the repair bill and the mechanic retains continuous possession of the automobile until such lien is satisfied, a tax lien filed in accordance with 26 U.S.C 6323(f)(1) which has attached to the automobile will not be valid to the extent of the reasonable price of the repairs. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the mechanic undertook the work or that the mechanic knew of the lien before undertaking the work.</P>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Real property tax and special assessment liens.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against the holder <PRTPAGE P="326"/>of another lien upon the real property (regardless of when such other lien arises), if such other lien is entitled under local law to priority over security interests in real property which are prior in time and if such other lien on real property secures payment of:</P>
                <P>(1) A tax of general application levied by any taxing authority based upon the value of the property, or</P>
                <P>(2) A special assessment imposed directly upon the property by any taxing authority, if the assessment is imposed for the purpose of defraying the cost of any public improvement; or</P>
                <P>(3) Charges for utilities or public services furnished to the property by the United States, a State or political subdivision thereof, or an instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Residential property subject to a mechanic's lien for certain repairs and improvements.</E> Even though a notice of lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against a mechanic's lienor (as defined in § 70.143(b) of this part) who holds a lien for the repair or improvement of a personal residence if:</P>
                <P>(1) The residence is occupied by the owner and contains no more than four dwelling units, and</P>
                <P>(2) The contract price on the prime contract with the owner for the repair or improvement (excluding interest and expenses described in § 70.147 of this part) is not more than $1,000. For purposes of this paragraph, the amounts of subcontracts under the prime contract with the owner are not to be taken into consideration for purposes of computing the $1,000 prime contract price. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien was filed before the contractor undertakes the work or that the contractor knew of the lien before undertaking the work.</P>
                <P>(h) <E T="03">Attorney's liens</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against an attorney who, under local law, holds a lien upon, or a contract enforceable against, a judgment or other amount in settlement of a claim or of a cause of action. The priority afforded an attorney's lien under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount of the attorney's reasonable compensation for obtaining the judgment or procuring the settlement. For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable compensation means the amount customarily allowed under local law for an attorney's service for litigating or settling a similar case or administrative claim. However, reasonable compensation shall be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each individual case. It is immaterial that the notice of tax lien is filed before the attorney undertakes the work or that the attorney knows of the tax lien before undertaking the work. This paragraph does not apply to an attorney's lien which may arise from the defense of a claim or cause of action against a taxpayer except to the extent such lien is held upon a judgment or other amount arising from the adjudication or settlement of a counterclaim in favor of the taxpayer. In case of suits against the taxpayer, see § 70.150(d)(2) of this part for rules relating to the subordination of the tax lien to facilitate tax collection.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Claim or cause of action against the United States.</E> Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to an attorney's lien with respect to:</P>
                <P>(i) Any judgment or other fund resulting from the successful litigation or settlement of an administrative claim or cause of action against the United States to the extent that the United States, under any legal or equitable right, offsets its liability under the judgment or settlement against any liability of the taxpayer to the United States, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Any amount credited against any liability of the taxpayer in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Certain insurance contracts.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 (with respect to any tax imposed under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau) is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid with respect to a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract, against an organization which is the insurer under the contract, at any time:<PRTPAGE P="327"/>
                </P>
                <P>(1) Before the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the existence of the tax lien.</P>
                <P>(2) After the insuring organization has actual notice or knowledge of the lien (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) with respect to advances (including contractual interest thereon as provided in § 70.147(a) of this part) required to be made automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the insuring organization had such actual notice or knowledge, or</P>

                <P>(3) After the satisfaction of a levy pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6332(b), unless and until the appropriate TTB officer delivers to the insuring organization a notice (for example, another notice of levy, a letter, <E T="03">etc.</E>), executed after the date of such satisfaction, that the lien exists.</P>
                <FP>Delivery of the notice described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section may be made by any means, including regular mail, and delivery of the notice shall be effective only from the time of actual receipt of the notification by the insuring organization. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to matured as well as unmatured insurance contracts.</FP>
                <P>(j) <E T="03">Passbook loans</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid against an institution described in 26 U.S.C. 581 or 591 to the extent of any loan made by the institution which is secured by a savings deposit, share, or other account evidenced by a passbook (as defined in paragraph (j)(2) of this section) if the institution has been continuously in possession of the passbook from the time the loan is made. This paragraph applies only to a loan made without actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the existence of the lien. Even though an original passbook loan is made without actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien, this paragraph does not apply to any additional loan made after knowledge of the lien is acquired by the institution even if it continues to retain the passbook from the time the original passbook loan is made.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definition of passbook.</E> For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, the term “passbook” includes:</P>

                <SUBJECT>Protection for commercial transactions financing agreements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid with respect to a security interest which:</P>
                <P>(1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing.</P>
                <P>(2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of a commercial transactions financing agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</P>
                <P>(3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of the tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.</P>
                <FP>See § 70.143 (a) and (e) of this part for definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing,” respectively. For purposes of this section, a judgment lien is a lien held by a judgment lien creditor as defined in § 70.143(g) of this part.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Commercial transactions financing agreement.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “commercial transactions financing agreement” means a written agreement entered into by a person in the course of such person's trade or business:</P>
                <P>(1) To make loans to the taxpayer (whether or not at the option of the person agreeing to make such loans) to be secured by commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business, or</P>

                <P>(2) To purchase commercial financing security, other than inventory, acquired by the taxpayer in the ordinary <PRTPAGE P="328"/>course of the taxpayer's trade or business.</P>
                <FP>Such an agreement qualifies as a commercial transactions financing agreement only with respect to loans or purchases made under the agreement before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing or the time when the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge (as defined in § 70.144(a) of this part) of the tax lien filing, if earlier. For purposes of this paragraph, a loan or purchase is considered to have been made in the course of the lender's or purchaser's trade or business if such person is in the business of financing commercial transactions (such as a bank or commercial factor) or if the agreement is incidental to the conduct of such person's trade or business. For example, if a manufacturer finances the accounts receivable of one of its customers, the manufacturer is considered to engage in such financing in the course of its trade or business. The extent of the priority of the lender or purchaser over the tax lien is the amount of the disbursement made before the 46th day after the date the notice of tax lien is filed, or made before the day (before such 46th day) on which the lender or purchaser has actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien.</FP>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Commercial financing security</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> The term “commercial financing security” means:</P>
                <P>(i) Paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions,</P>
                <P>(ii) Accounts receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section),</P>
                <P>(iii) Mortgages on real property, and</P>
                <P>(iv) Inventory.</P>
                <P>For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “paper of a kind ordinarily arising in commercial transactions” in general includes any written document customarily used in commercial transactions. For example, such written documents include paper giving contract rights (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), chattel paper, documents of title to personal property, and negotiable instruments or securities. The term “commercial financing security” does not include general intangibles such as patents or copyrights. A mortgage on real estate (including a deed of trust, contract for sale, and similar instrument) may be commercial financing security if the taxpayer has an interest in the mortgage as a mortgagee or assignee. The term “commercial financing security” does not include a mortgage when the taxpayer is the mortgagor of realty owned by the taxpayer. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “inventory” includes raw materials and goods in process as well as property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of §§ 70.143 and 70.146 of this part, and this section:</P>
                <P>(i) A contract right is any right to payment under a contract not yet earned by performance and not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper, and</P>
                <P>(ii) An account receivable is any right to payment for goods sold or leased or for services rendered which is not evidenced by an instrument or chattel paper.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Qualified property.</E> For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, qualified property consists solely of commercial financing security acquired by the taxpayer-debtor before the 46th day after the date of tax lien filing. Commercial financing security acquired before such day may be qualified property even though it is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender received actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the tax lien. For example, although the receipt of actual notice or knowledge of the filing of the notice of the tax lien has the effect of ending the period within which protected disbursements may be made to the taxpayer, property which is acquired by the taxpayer after the lender receives actual notice or knowledge of such filing and before such 46th day, which otherwise qualifies as commercial financing security, becomes commercial financing security to which the priority of the lender extends for loans made before the lender received the actual notice or knowledge. An account receivable (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer at the time, and to the extent, a right to payment is earned by performance. Chattel paper, <PRTPAGE P="329"/>documents of title, negotiable instruments, securities, and mortgages on real estate are acquired by a taxpayer when the taxpayer obtains rights in the paper or mortgage. Inventory is acquired by the taxpayer when title passes to the taxpayer. A contract right (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) is acquired by a taxpayer when the contract is made. Indentifiable proceeds, which arise from the collection or disposition of qualified property by the taxpayer, are considered to be acquired at the time such qualified property is acquired if the secured party has a continuously perfected security interest in the proceeds under local law. The term “proceeds” includes whatever is received when collateral is sold, exchanged, or collected. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “identifiable proceeds” does not include money, checks and the like which have been commingled with other cash proceeds. Property acquired by the taxpayer after the 45th day following tax lien filing, by the expenditure of proceeds, is not qualified property.</P>

                <FP>For purposes of paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, construction or improvement may include demolition. For purposes of any agreement described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the furnishing of goods and services is treated as the disbursement of cash.</FP>

                <SUBJECT>Protection for obligatory disbursement agreements.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Even though a notice of a lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 is filed in accordance with § 70.148 of this part, the lien is not valid with respect to security interest which:</P>
                <P>(1) Comes into existence after the tax lien filing,</P>
                <P>(2) Is in qualified property covered by the terms of an obligatory disbursement agreement entered into before the tax lien filing, and</P>
                <P>(3) Is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time of tax lien filing, out of an unsecured obligation.</P>
                <FP>See § 70.143 (a) and (e) of this part for definitions of the terms “security interest” and “tax lien filing.” For purposes of this section, a judgment lien creditor as defined in § 70.143(g) of this part.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Obligatory disbursement agreement.</E> For purposes of this section, the term “obligatory disbursement agreement” means a written agreement, entered into by a person in the course of the person's trade or business, to make disbursements. An agreement is treated as an obligatory disbursement agreement only with respect to disbursements which are required to be made by reason of the intervention of the rights of a person other than the taxpayer. The obligation to pay must be conditioned upon an event beyond the control of the obligor. For example, the provisions of this section are applicable where an issuing bank obligates itself to honor drafts or other demands for payment on a letter of credit and a bank, in good faith, relies upon that letter of credit in making advances. The provisions of this section are also applicable, for example, where a bonding company obligates itself to make payments to indemnify against loss or liability and, under the terms of the bond, makes a payment with respect to a loss. The priority described in this section is not applicable, for example, in the case of an accommodation endorsement by an endorser who assumes the obligation other than in the course of the endorser's trade or business.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Qualified property.</E> Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the term “qualified property,” for purposes of this section, means property subject to the lien imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6321 at the time of tax lien filing and, to the extent that the acquisition is directly traceable to the obligatory disbursement, property acquired by the taxpayer after tax lien filing.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Special rule for surety agreements.</E> Where the obligatory disbursement agreement is an agreement insuring the performance of a contract of the taxpayer and another person, the term “qualified property” shall be treated as also including:</P>
                <P>(1) The proceeds of the contract the performance of which was insured, and</P>
                <P>(2) If the contract the performance of which was insured is a contract to construct or improve real property, to produce goods, or to furnish services, any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the performance of the insured contract.</P>
                <FP>For example, a surety company which holds a security interest, arising from cash disbursements made after tax lien filing under a payment or performance bond on a real estate construction project, has priority over the tax lien with respect to the proceeds of the construction contract and, in addition, with respect to any tangible personal property used by the taxpayer in the construction project if its security interest in the tangible personal property is protected under local law against a judgment lien arising, as of the time the tax lien was filed, out of an unsecured obligation.</FP>

The taxpayer must establish the amount necessary to comply with the order or decree. The appropriate TTB officer is not required to release a levy until such time as that officer is satisfied that the amount to be released from levy will actually be applied in satisfaction of the support obligation. The appropriate TTB officer may make arrangements with a delinquent taxpayer to establish a specific amount of such taxpayer's salary, wage, or other income for each pay period which shall be exempt from levy. Any request for such an arrangement shall be directed to the appropriate TTB officer. Where the taxpayer has more than one source of income sufficient to satisfy the support obligation imposed by the order or decree, the amount exempt from levy may at the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer be allocated entirely to one salary, wage, or source of other income or be apportioned between the several salaries, wages, or other sources of income.</P>

No provisions of a State law may exempt property or rights to property from levy for the collection of any Federal tax. Thus, property exempt from execution under State personal or homestead exemption laws is, nevertheless, subject to levy by the United States for collection of its taxes.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Wages, salary and other income.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a)(9) and (d) certain amounts payable to or received by a taxpayer as wages, salary or other income are exempt from levy. This section described the income of a taxpayer that is eligible for the exemption from levy (paragraph (b) of this section) and how exempt amounts are to be paid to the taxpayer (paragraph (c) of this section). Section 70.243 of this part describes the sum which will be exempt from levy for each of the taxpayer's payroll periods. Payroll periods are described in § 70.244 of this part. Amounts exempt from levy are determined in part by the number of persons claimed by the taxpayer as dependents. Section 70.245 of this part describes the manner in which the taxpayer is to claim any dependent exemptions and the manner in which the employer is to compute the exempt amount and pay the balance to the appropriate TTB officer.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligible taxpayer income.</E> Only wages, salary or other income payable to the taxpayer after the levy is made on the payor may be exempt from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334 (a)(9). No amount of wages, salary or other income which is paid to the taxpayer before levy is made on the payor will be so exempt from levy.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Payment of exempt amounts to taxpayer</E>—(1) <E T="03">From wages, salary or other income not subject to levy.</E> In the case of a taxpayer who has more than one source of wages, salary or other income, the appropriate TTB officer may elect to levy on only one or more such source while leaving other sources of salary or other income free from levy. If those wages, salary or other income which the appropriate TTB officer leaves free from levy equal or exceed the amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption from levy under 26 U.S.C. 6334(a)(9) and (d) and § 70.243 of this part (and ar not otherwise exempt), then no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income on which the appropriate TTB officer elects to levy is exempt from levy. The appropriate TTB officer shall notify the employer or other person subject to levy that no amount of the taxpayer's wages, salary or other income is exempt from levy.<PRTPAGE P="333"/>
                </P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">From wages, salary or other income subject to levy.</E> If the taxpayer's income upon which the appropriate TTB officer does not levy is less than that amount to which the taxpayer is entitled as an exemption, then an amount determined pursuant to § 70.243 of this part is to be paid to the taxpayer from those wages, salary or other income which are subject to levy. The appropriate TTB officer will designate those wages, salary or other income subject to levy from which such amount will be paid to the taxpayer. The appropriate TTB officer will generally make this designation by delivering to the employer, or other person levied upon, the form upon which the taxpayer is to claim any dependent exemption. The form will acompany the notice of levy. The person receiving the form from the appropriate TTB officer must promptly deliver it to the taxpayer. In the case of some employers having a large number of employees, however, the appropriate TTB officer will send the form upon which an employee is to claim any dependent exemption diretly to the employee. In such a case, the notice of levy will indicate that the form for claiming dependent exemptions has been sent to the taxpayer. If a notice of levy is not accompanied by the form for claiming dependent exemptions and does not indicate that the form was sent directly to the taxpayer, then the person levied upon must make payment to the appropriate TTB officer without regard to amounts prescribed by § 70.243 of this part as exempt from levy. If a notice of levy is accompanied by the form for claiming dependent exemptions or indicates that the form was sent directly to the taxpayer, then the person levied upon is to pay over to the taxpayer, amounts determined to be exempt from levy pursuant to § 70.243 and § 70.245 (b) and (c) of this part (relating to the requirement that the taxpayer submit a claim for any dependent exemption). Amounts not exempt from levy are to be paid to the appropriate TTB officer in accordance with the terms of the levy.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> Unless advised by the appropriate TTB officer that no part of the money due to the taxpayer is exempt from levy, the employer or other person levied upon will compute the exempt amount, using the formula in § 70.243 of this part and the taxpayer's statement of exemptions and filing status described in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement of exemptions and filing status.</E> Unless the taxpayer submits a statement of exemptions and filing status to the employer or other person levied upon, the exempt amount will be applied as if the taxpayer were a married individual filing a separate return with only 1 personal exemption. A statement of exemptions and filing status shall be made by either:</P>
                <P>(1) Completion of the form provided for this purpose by the Bureau, or</P>
                <P>(2) A written statement that:</P>
                <P>(i) Gives the taxpayer's filing status for income tax purposes,</P>
                <P>(ii) Shows any additional standard deduction if the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse is at least 65 and/or blind,</P>
                <P>(iii) Identified by name and by relationship to the taxpayer each person for whom a dependent exemption is claimed,</P>
                <P>(iv) Is signed by the taxpayer, and</P>
                <P>(v) Contains a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Time for submission of statement.</E> The taxpayer must submit the statement of exemptions and filing status to the employer or other person levied upon no later than the later of:</P>
                <P>(1) The third day before the last day of the payroll period for which the exemption is claimed (that is, the third day before payday), or</P>
                <P>(2) If the appropriate TTB officer delivers the forms for the statement of exemption and filing status to the employer or other person levied upon (see § 70.242(c)(2) of this part), the second day after the date the taxpayer receives the form.</P>

                <P>(1) The expiration of 6 months from the date of the filing of the claim for credit or refund, or</P>
                <P>(2) A decision is rendered on such claim prior to the expiration of 6 months after the filing thereof. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no suit or proceeding for the recovery of any tax, penalty, or other sum imposed under the provision of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau may be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the date of mailing, by either registered or certified mail, by an appropriate TTB officer, to a taxpayer of a statutory notice of disallowance of the part of the claim to which the suit or proceeding relates.</P>
                <P>(b) The 2-year period described in paragraph (a) of this section may be extended if an agreement to extend the running of the period of limitations is executed. The agreement must be signed by the taxpayer or by an attorney, agent, trustee, or other fiduciary on behalf of the taxpayer. If the agreement is signed by a person other than the taxpayer, it shall be accompanied by an authenticated copy of the power of attorney or other legal evidence of the authority of such person to act on behalf of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is a corporation, the agreement should be signed with the corporate name followed by the signature of a duly authorized officer of the corporation. The agreement will not be effective until signed by an appropriate officer.</P>
                <P>(c) The taxpayer may sign a waiver of the requirement that the taxpayer be mailed a notice of disallowance. Such waiver is irrevocable and will commence the running of the 2-year period described in paragraph (a) of this section on the date the waiver is filed. The waiver shall set forth:</P>
                <P>(1) The type of tax and the taxable period covered by the taxpayer's claim for refund;</P>

                <FP>The filing of such a waiver prior to the expiration of 6 monthes from the date the claim was filed does not permit the filing of a suit for refund prior to the time specified in section 6532(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section.</FP>

                <P>(2) <E T="03">Applicable provisions.</E> The provisions of 26 U.S.C. made applicable by 26 U.S.C. 6901(a) to the liability of a transferee referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, include the provisions relating to:</P>
                <P>(i) Delinquency in payment after notice and demand and the amount of interest attaching because of such delinquency;</P>

The extension shall become effective when the agreement has been executed by both parties. The period <PRTPAGE P="339"/>agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Extension of times for credit or refund.</E> (i) For the purposes of determining the period of limitations on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments made by such transferee or overpayments made by the taxpayer to which such transferee may be legally entitled to credit or refund, an agreement and any extension thereof referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof for purposes of 26 U.S.C. 6511(c) (relating to limitations on credit or refund in case of extension of time by agreement).</P>
                <P>(ii) For the purpose of determining the limit specified in 26 U.S.C. 6511(c)(2) on the amount of the credit or refund, if the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment against the taxpayer with reference to whom the liability of such transferee arises, the periods specified in 26 U.S.C. 6511(b)(2) shall be increased by the period from the date of such expiration to the date the agreement is executed.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Period of assessment against taxpayer.</E> For the purpose of determining the period of limitations for assessment against a transferee, if the taxpayer is deceased, or, in the case of a corporation, has terminated its existence, the period of limitations for assessment against the taxpayer shall be the period that would be in effect had the termination of existence not occurred.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Fees and costs for witnesses.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Introduction.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7610 provides that the Bureau may make payments to certain persons who are summoned to give information to the Bureau under 26 U.S.C. 7602 and § 70.22 of this part. Under 26 U.S.C. 7610 witnesses generally will not be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred but instead will be paid in accordance with the payment rates established by regulations. Paragraph (b) of this section contains elaborations of certain terms found in 26 U.S.C. 7610 and definitions of other terms used in the regulations under 26 U.S.C. 7610 (a) and (b); and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section contain rules and rates applicable to payments under 26 U.S.C. 7610.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Directly incurred costs.</E> Directly incurred costs are costs incurred solely, immediately, and necessarily as a consequence of searching for, reproducing, or transporting records in order to comply with a summons. They do not include a proportionate allocation of fixed costs, such as overhead, equipment depreciation, etc. However, where a third party's records are stored at an independent storage facility that charges the third party a search fee to search for, reproduce, or transport particular records requested, these fees are considered to be directly incurred by the summoned third party.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Reproduction cost.</E> Reproduction costs are costs incurred in making copies or duplicates of summoned documents, transcripts, and other similar material.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Search costs.</E> Search costs include only the total cost of personnel time directly incurred in searching for records or information and the cost of retrieving information stored by computer. Salaries of persons locating and retrieving summoned material are not included in search costs. Also, search costs do not include salaries, fees, or similar expenditures for analysis of material or for managerial or legal advice, expertise, or research, or time spent for these activities.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Third party.</E> A third party is any person served with a summons, other than a person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued, or an officer, employee, agent, accountant, or attorney of that person.</P>
                <P>(5) <E T="03">Third party records.</E> Third party records are books, papers, records, or other data in which the person with respect to whose liability a summons is issued does not have a proprietary interest at the time the summons is served.</P>
                <P>(6) <E T="03">Transportation costs.</E> Transportation costs include only costs incurred to transport personnel to search for records or information requested and costs incurred solely by the need to transport the summoned material to the place of examination. These costs do not include the cost of transporting the summoned witness for appearance at the place of examination. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for payment of travel expenses.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Conditions and rates of payments</E>—(1) <E T="03">Basis for payment.</E> Payment for search, reproduction, and transportation costs will be made only to third parties served with a summons to produce third party records or information and only for material requested by the summons. Payment will be made only for those costs both directly incurred and reasonably necessary. No payment will be made until the third party has satisfactorily complied with the summons and has submitted an itemized bill or invoice showing specific details concerning the costs to the Bureau employee before whom the third party was summoned. If a third party charges any other person for any cost for which the third party is seeking payment from the Bureau, the amount charged to the other person <PRTPAGE P="342"/>must be subtracted from the amount the Bureau must pay.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Payment rates.</E> The following rates are established.</P>
                <P>(i) <E T="03">Search costs.</E> (A) For the total amount of personnel time required to locate records or information, $8.50 per person hour.</P>
                <P>(B) For retrieval of information stored by computer in the format in which it is normally produced, actual costs, based on computer time and necessary supplies, except that personnel time for computer search is payable only under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(ii) <E T="03">Reproduction costs.</E> (A) For copies of documents $.20 per page.</P>
                <P>(B) For photographers, films and other materials, actual cost, except that personnel time is payable only under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(iii) <E T="03">Transportation costs.</E> For transportation costs, actual cost, except that personnel time is payable only under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Appearance fees and allowances</E>—(1) <E T="03">In general.</E> Under 26 U.S.C. 7610(a)(1) and this paragraph, the Bureau shall pay a summoned person certain fees and allowances. No payments will be made until after the party summoned appears and has submitted any necessary receipts or other evidence of costs to the Bureau employee before whom the person was summoned.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Attendance fees.</E> A summoned person shall be paid an attendance fee for each day's attendance. A summoned person shall also be paid the attendance fee for the time necessarily occupied in going to and returning from the place of attendance at the beginning and end of the attendance or at any time during the attendance. The attendance fee is the higher of $30 per day or the amount paid under 28 U.S.C. 1821(b) to witnesses in attendance at courts of the United States at the time of the summoned person's appearance.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Travel allowances.</E> A summoned person who travels by common carrier shall be paid for the actual expenses of travel on the basis of the means of transportation reasonably utilized and the distance necessarily traveled to and from the summoned person's residence by the shortest practical route in going to and returning from the place of attendance. Such a summoned person shall utilize a common carrier at the most economical rate reasonably available. A receipt or other evidence of actual cost shall be furnished. A travel allowance equal to the mileage allowance which the Administrator of General Services has prescribed, under 5 U.S.C. 5704, for official travel of employees of the Federal Government shall be paid to each summoned person who travels by privately owned vehicle. Computation of mileage under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of a uniform table of distances adopted by the Administrator of General Services. Toll charges for toll roads, bridges, tunnels and ferries, taxicab fares between places of lodging and carrier terminals, and parking fees (upon presentation of a valid parking receipt) shall be paid in full to a summoned person incurring those expenses.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Subsistence allowances.</E> A subsistence allowance shall be paid to a summoned person (other than a summoned person who is incarcerated) when an overnight stay is required at the place of attendance because the place is so far removed from the residence of the summoned person as to prohibit return thereto from day to day. A subsistence allowance for a summoned person shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowance prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, under 5 U.S.C. 5702(a), for official travel in the area of attendance by employees of the Federal Government. An alien who has been paroled into the United States by the Attorney General, under 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)(A), or an alien who either has admitted belonging to a class of aliens who are deportable or has been determined under 8 U.S.C. 1252(b) to be deportable, shall be ineligible to receive the fees or allowances provided for under 26 U.S.C. 7610(a)(1).</P>

                <SUBJECT>Timely mailing treated as timely filing.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Title 26 U.S.C. 7502 provides that, if the requirements of such section are met, a document shall be deemed to be filed on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which such document was mailed. Thus, if the cover containing such document bears a timely postmark, the document will be considered filed timely although it is received after the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing such document. Title 26 U.S.C. 7502 is applicable only to those documents which come within the definition of such term provided by paragraph (b) of this section and only if the document is mailed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and is delivered in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Document defined.</E> The term <E T="03">document,</E> as used in this section, means any return, claim, statement, or other document required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by the Bureau.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Mailing requirements.</E> (1) Title 26 U.S.C. 7502 is not applicable unless the document is mailed in accordance with the following requirements:</P>
                <P>(i) The document must be contained in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper, properly addressed to the agency, officer, or office with which the document is required to be filed.</P>

                <P>(ii) The document must be deposited within the prescribed time in the mail in the United States with sufficient postage prepaid. For this purpose, a document is deposited in the mail in the United States when it is deposited with the domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service, as defined by the postal regulations (39 CFR Part 2). Title 26 U.S.C. 7502 does not apply to any document which is deposited with the mail service of any other country.<PRTPAGE P="344"/>
                </P>
                <P>(iii)(A) If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper is made by the U.S. Postal Service, such postmark must bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document. If the postmark does not bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document, the document will be considered not to be filed timely, regardless of when the document is deposited in the mail. Accordingly, the sender who relies upon the applicability of 26 U.S.C. 7502 assumes the risk that the postmark will bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document, but see paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with respect to the use of registered mail or certified mail to avoid this risk. If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper is not legible, the person who is required to file the document has the burden of proving the time when the postmark was made. Furthermore, in case the cover containing a document bearing a timely postmark made by the U.S. Postal Service is received after the time when a document postmarked and mailed at such time would ordinarily be received, the sender may be required to prove that it was timely mailed.</P>
                <P>(B) If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper is made other than by the U.S. Postal Service, the postmark so made must bear a date on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document, and the document must be received by the agency, officer, or office with which it is required to be filed not later than the time when a document contained in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper which is properly addressed and mailed and sent by the same class of mail would ordinarily be received if it were postmarked at the same point of origin by the U.S. Postal Service on the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document. However, in case the document is received after the time when a document so mailed and so postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service would ordinarily be received, such document will be treated as having been received at the time when a document so mailed and so postmarked would ordinarily be received, if the person who is required to file the document establishes that it was actually deposited in the mail before the last collection of the mail from the place of deposit which was postmarked (except for the metered mail) by the U.S. Postal Service on or before the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document, that the delay in receiving the document was due to a delay in the transmission of the mail, and the cause of such delay. If the envelope has a postmark made by the U.S. Postal Service in addition to the postmark not so made, the postmark which was not made by the U.S. Postal Service shall be disregarded, and whether the envelope was mailed in accordance with this section shall be determined solely by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.</P>
                <P>(2) If the document is sent by U.S. registered mail, the date of registration of the document shall be treated as the postmark date. If the document is sent by U.S. certified mail and the sender's receipt is postmarked by the postal employee to whom such document is presented, the date of the U.S. postmark on such receipt shall be treated as the postmark date of the document. Accordingly, the risk that the document will not be postmarked on the day that it is deposited in the mail may be overcome by the use of registered mail or certified mail.</P>
                <P>(3) As used in this section, the term “the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document” includes any extension of time granted for such filing. Except as provided in 26 U.S.C. 5061 for the filing of returns and payment of a tax under 26 U.S.C. subtitle E, when the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, 26 U.S.C. 7503 is also applicable, so that, in applying the rules of this paragraph, the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, shall be treated as the last date, or the last day of the period, prescribed for filing the document.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Delivery.</E> (1) Title 26 U.S.C. 7502 is not applicable unless the document is delivered by U.S. mail to the agency, <PRTPAGE P="345"/>officer, or office with which it is required to be filed. However, if the document is sent by registered mail or certified mail, proof that the document was properly registered or that a postmarked certified mail sender's receipt was properly issued therefor, and that the envelope or wrapper was properly addressed to such agency, officer or office shall constitute prima facie evidence that the document was delivered to such agency, officer or office.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Collection.</E> Taxes on distilled spirits, wines, and beer are paid by returns. If the person responsible for paying the taxes has filed a proper bond to defer payment, that person may be eligible to file semimonthly or quarterly returns, with proper remittances, to cover the taxes incurred on distilled spirits, wines, and beer during the semimonthly or quarterly period. Payment must accompany the return unless required to be made by electronic fund transfer (EFT). If the taxpayer is not qualified to defer taxpayment, or has been placed on a prepayment basis, the taxpayer must prepay the tax on the distilled spirits, wines, or beer. Distilled spirits, wines, and beer tax returns are filed in accordance with the instruction on the return forms, which are furnished to industry members by TTB. Detailed information respecting the payment of tax on liquors, including the forms to be used and procedures to be followed, is contained in the respective regulations described in § 70.411(c).</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Assessment.</E> If additional or delinquent tax liability is disclosed by an investigation, or by an examination of records, of a qualified plant or permittee, a notice (except where delay may jeopardize collection of the tax, or where the amount involved is nominal or the result of an evident mathematical error) is sent to the taxpayer advising of the basis and amount of the liability and affording the taxpayer an opportunity to submit a protest, with supporting facts, or to request a conference.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Claims.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">Claims for remission.</E> When distilled spirits (including distilling material and denatured spirits), wine, or beer on which the tax has not been paid or determined is lost, and the person liable for payment of the tax thereon desires to be relieved from such liability, such person may file claim on Form 5620.8 for remission of tax on the quantity <PRTPAGE P="351"/>that was lost. The appropriate TTB officer may, in any event, require such a claim to be filed, and will require it if circumstances indicate that the loss was caused by theft or, in the case of distilled spirits (including distilling material), unauthorized voluntary destruction. On receipt of a claim the appropriate TTB officer makes a factual determination, and notifies the claimant of allowance or rejection of the claim. If the claim is rejected, and circumstances so warrant, the appropriate TTB officer will take appropriate steps to collect the tax.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Claims for abatement.</E> When the tax on distilled spirits, wines, or beer is assessed and the taxpayer thinks that the tax is not due under the law, such taxpayer may file a claim for abatement of the tax on TTB Form 5620.8 with the officer who made demand for the tax. Such officer may call upon the taxpayer to file a bond in double the amount of the tax in order to insure collection of the tax if the claim is rejected. When the claim is acted upon, the taxpayer is notified of the allowance or rejection of the claim. If the claim is rejected, such officer, will initiate action to collect the tax.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Claims for refund</E>—(1) <E T="03">Taxes illegally, erroneously, or excessively collected.</E> A claim for refund of taxes illegally, erroneously, or excessively collected may be filed by the taxpayer with the officer who collected the tax. Such claim must be filed within three years (two years under certain circumstances) after the date of payment of the tax. If the claim is rejected, the taxpayer is notified of the rejection by registered or certified mail, and the taxpayer may then bring suit in the U.S. District Court or the Court of Claims for recovery of the tax. Such suits must be filed generally within two years from the date of mailing of the rejection notice. If the claim is allowed, a check for the amount of the refund and allowable interest is forwarded to the taxpayer; however, if there are other unpaid taxes outstanding against the taxpayer, the overpayment may be applied to the outstanding taxes and the balance, if any, refunded.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Taxes on liquors lost, destroyed, returned to bond, or taken as samples by the United States.</E> A taxpayer may, subject to the conditions in the appropriate regulations, file claim on Form 5620.8 for refund of tax paid on:</P>
                <P>(i) Spirits returned to bonded premises, lost by accident or disaster, or taken as samples by the United States, or</P>
                <P>(ii) Wine returned to bond or lost by disaster, or</P>
                <P>(iii) Beer returned to a brewery or voluntarily destroyed, or lost, whether by theft or otherwise, or destroyed or otherwise rendered unmerchantable by fire, casualty, or act of God. If the claim is allowed, a check for the amount of the refund is forwarded to the claimant; except, that where there are any unpaid taxes outstanding against the claimant, the refund may be applied to the outstanding taxes and a check for the balance, if any, forwarded to the claimant. If the claim is rejected, a copy of the claim giving the reasons for rejection is forwarded to the claimant.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Claims for allowance, credit, or relief.</E> A qualified permittee, manufacturer, or proprietor may, subject to the conditions in the appropriate regulations, file claim on Form 5620.8 for allowance of loss, credit of tax, or relief from tax liability, as applicable, on</P>
                <P>(1) Spirits returned to bonded premises, lost or destroyed on bonded premises, or in transit thereto, or lost by accident or disaster;</P>
                <P>(2) Wine lost or destroyed on bonded premises or in transit thereto and wine returned to bond;</P>
                <P>(3) Beer returned to a brewery or voluntarily destroyed, or lost, whether by theft or otherwise, or destroyed or otherwise rendered unmerchantable by fire, casualty, or act of God;</P>
                <P>(4) Denatured spirits lost or destroyed in bond, or lost on the premises of a qualified dealer or user or in transit to such premises; and</P>
                <P>(5) Tax-free spirits lost on the premises of a qualified user or in transit to such premises.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Claims for payment-disaster losses.</E> When distilled spirits, wines, rectified products, or beer held or intended for sale is lost, rendered unmarketable, or condemned by a duly authorized official by reason of a “major disaster” as determined by the President of the <PRTPAGE P="352"/>United States, the person holding such product for sale at that time may, subject to the conditions in the appropriate regulations, file a claim on form TTB F 5620.8 for payment of an amount equal to the internal revenue taxes paid or determined and any customs duties paid thereon. Claims must be filed within 6 months from the date on which the President makes the determination that the disaster has occurred. The determination date is construed to mean the date the Director, Office of Emergency Preparedness, identifies the specific disaster area.</P>

                <P>(a) <E T="03">Tobacco products.</E> Taxes on tobacco products are paid by the manufacturer on the basis of a return. If the manufacturer has filed a proper bond, such manufacturer may defer payment at the time of removal and file semimonthly returns to cover the taxes. If the manufacturer has not filed such a <PRTPAGE P="356"/>bond or if the manufacturer has defaulted in any way in paying the taxes, the manufacturer is required to file a prepayment return prior to removal of such products, and to continue so doing until the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by deferred payment. Tax returns, with remittances, are filed by the domestic manufacturer in accordance with instructions on the appropriate TTB form. Taxes on cigars produced in a customs bonded manufacturing warehouse, Class 6, are paid on the basis of a return to the director of customs in accordance with customs procedures and regulations. Taxes on tobacco products imported or brought into the United States from a foreign country, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States are paid by the importer to the director of customs on the basis of a return made on the customs form by which release from customs custody is to be effected. However, taxes on tobacco products manufactured in Puerto Rico and brought into the United States may be prepaid in Puerto Rico on the basis of a return. If a Puerto Rican manufacturer has filed a proper bond, such manufacturer may defer payment at the time of release for shipment to the United States and file a semimonthly return to cover the taxes. If the manufacturer has not filed such a bond or if such manufacturer has defaulted in any way in payment of taxes, the manufacturer must file a prepayment return prior to removal of such products for shipment to the United States, and continue to do so until the appropriate TTB officer finds that the revenue will not be jeopardized by deferred payment. Tax returns, with remittances, are filed by the domestic manufacturer in accordance with instructions on the appropriate TTB form.</P>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Cigarette papers and tubes.</E> Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes are paid by the manufacturer on the basis of a semimonthly return. Such returns, with remittances, are filed in accordance with the instructions on the appropriate TTB form. Taxes on cigarette papers and tubes imported or brought into the United States from a foreign country, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States are paid to the director of customs before removal on the basis of a return made on the customs form by which release from customs custody is effected. However, taxes on cigarette papers and tubes of Puerto Rican manufacture which are to be shipped to the United States may be prepaid in Puerto Rico on the basis of a return.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Special tax.</E> Special (occupational) taxes are paid by manufacturers of tobacco products, manufacturers of cigarette papers and tubes, and export warehouse proprietors on the basis of a return. Special tax stamps are issued to denote the payment of special (occupational) taxes.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">General.</E> Detailed information about the payment of taxes on tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes, including the forms to be used, records to be kept, and reports and inventories to be filed, is contained in the respective regulations referred to in § 70.431.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Offers in compromise of liabilities (other than forfeiture) under 26 U.S.C.</SUBJECT>
                <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> The appropriate TTB officer may compromise any civil or criminal liability arising under the provisions of 26 U.S.C. enforced and administered by TTB prior to reference of a case involving such liability to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense. (For compromise of forfeiture liability, see § 70.484 of this part.) Any such liability may be compromised only upon one or both of the following two grounds:</P>
                <P>(1) Doubt as to liability; or</P>
                <P>(2) Doubt as to collectibility.</P>
                <FP>No such liability will be compromised if the liability has been established by a valid judgment or is certain, and there is no doubt as to the ability of the Government to collect the amounts owing with respect to such liability.</FP>
                <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope of compromise agreement.</E> A compromise agreement may relate to civil or criminal liability for taxes, interest, ad valorem penalties, or specific penalties. However, a criminal liability may be compromised only if it involves a violation of a regulatory provision of 26 U.S.C., or a related statute, and then only if such violation was not deliberately committed with an intent to defraud.</P>
                <P>(c) <E T="03">Effect of compromise agreement.</E> A compromise agreement relates to the entire liability of the taxpayer (including taxes, ad valorem penalties, and interest) with respect to which the offer in compromise is submitted and all questions of such liability are conclusively settled thereby. Specific penalties, however, shall be compromised separately and not in connection with taxes, interest, or ad valorem penalties. Neither the taxpayer nor the Government shall, upon acceptance of an offer in compromise, be permitted to reopen the case except by reason of falsification or concealment of assets by the taxpayer, or mutual mistake of a material fact sufficient to cause a contract to be reformed or set aside. However, acceptance of an offer in compromise of a civil liability does not remit a criminal liability, nor does acceptance of an offer in compromise of a criminal liability remit a civil liability.</P>
                <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure with respect to offers in compromise</E>—(1) <E T="03">Submission of offers.</E> (i) Offers in compromise under this section shall be submitted on TTB Form 5640.1, along with any additional information required by the officer authorized to accept or reject the offer. If the offer in compromise is based on inability to pay, the proponent must submit any financial statement required by such officer.</P>
                <P>(ii) The offer should generally be accompanied by a remittance representing the amount of the compromise offer or a deposit if the offer provides for future installment payments. When final action has been taken, the proponent is notified of the acceptance or rejection of the offer.</P>
                <P>(2) <E T="03">Stay of collection.</E> The submission of an offer in compromise shall not automatically operate to stay the collection of any tax liability. However, <PRTPAGE P="363"/>enforcement of collection may be deferred if the interests of the United States will not be jeopardized thereby.</P>
                <P>(3) <E T="03">Acceptance.</E> An offer in compromise shall be considered accepted only when the proponent thereof is so notified in writing. As a condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the taxpayer may be required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security which is deemed necessary for the protection of the interests of the United States. If the final payment on an accepted offer is contingent upon the immediate or simultaneous release of a tax lien in whole or in part, such payment must be in cash, or in the form of a certified, cashier's, or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal, bank, express, or telegraph money order.</P>
                <P>(4) <E T="03">Withdrawal or rejection.</E> An offer in compromise may be withdrawn by the proponent at any time prior to its acceptance. In the event an offer is rejected, the proponent shall be promptly notified in writing. Frivolous offers or offers submitted for the purpose of delaying the collection of tax liabilities shall be immediately rejected. If an offer in compromise is withdrawn or rejected, the amount tendered with the offer, including all installments paid, shall be refunded without interest, unless the taxpayer has stated or agreed that the amount tendered may be applied to the liability with respect to which the offer was submitted.</P>
                <P>(e) <E T="03">Record.</E> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, if an offer in compromise is accepted, there shall be placed on file the opinion of counsel for the Bureau with respect to such compromise, with the reason therefor, and including a statement of:</P>
                <P>(1) The amount of tax assessed,</P>
                <P>(2) The amount of interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty, imposed by law on the person against whom the tax is assessed, and</P>
                <P>(3) The amount actually paid in accordance with the terms of the compromise.</P>
                <FP>However, no such opinion shall be required with respect to the offer in compromise of any civil case in which the unpaid amount of tax assessed (including any interest, additional amount, addition to the tax, or assessable penalty is less than $50,000. However, such compromise shall be subject to continuing quality review by the Secretary.</FP>
                <P>(f) <E T="03">Requirement with respect to statute of limitations.</E> No offer in compromise shall be accepted unless the taxpayer waives the running of the statutory period of limitations on both or either assessment or collection of the tax liability involved for the period during which the offer is pending, or the period during which any installment remains unpaid, and for one year thereafter.</P>
                <P>(g) <E T="03">Inspection with respect to accepted offers in compromise.</E> For provisions relating to the inspection of returns and accepted offers in compromise, <E T="03">see</E> 26 U.S.C. 6103(k)(l).</P>

A closing agreement may be entered into in any case in which there appears to be an advantage in having the case permanently and conclusively closed, or if good and sufficient reasons are shown by the taxpayer for desiring a closing agreement and it is determined by the appropriate TTB officer that the United States will sustain no disadvantage through consummation of such an agreement.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 70.701</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Rules and regulations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Formulation.</E> (1) Alcohol, tobacco, and firearms rules take various forms. The most important rules are issued as Treasury decisions, prescribed by the Administrator, and approved by the Secretary. Other rules may be issued over the signature of the Administrator or the signature of any appropriate TTB officer. The channeling of rules varies with the circumstances. Treasury decisions are prepared within the appropriate TTB offices. After approval by the Administrator, Treasury decisions are forwarded to the Secretary for further consideration and final approval.</P>

              <P>(2) Where required by 5 U.S.C. 553, the Administrator publishes in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> general notice of proposed rules unless all persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. Notice may also be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in such other instances as may be desirable. This notice includes (i) a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rulemaking proceedings; (ii) reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and (iii) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. Interested persons may participate in the rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons may also submit requests for a <PRTPAGE P="371"/>public hearing. However, the Bureau reserves the right to determine, in the light of all circumstances, whether a public hearing should be held.</P>

              <P>(3) If the Bureau determines that the public good will be served thereby, it may hold a public hearing for discussion of the issues raised by the proposed regulations. Such a hearing is announced by a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> stating the time and place where the hearing is to be held. The following rules govern the conduct of the public hearing only if incorporated by reference in the notice announcing the hearing:</P>
              <P>(i) A person wishing to make oral comments at a public hearing shall submit, within the time prescribed in the notice of hearing, an outline of the topics he wishes to discuss, and the time he wishes to devote to each topic. Ordinarily, a period of 10 minutes is the time allotted to each person for making his oral comments.</P>
              <P>(ii) A person making oral comments should be prepared to answer questions not only on the topics listed in his outline but also on matters relating to any written comments which he has submitted.</P>
              <P>(iii) At the conclusion of the presentation of comments of persons listed in the agenda, to the extent time permits, other comments will be received.</P>
              <P>(iv) Written comments submitted prior to the hearing shall be available at the hearing for inspection. Any request for copies of such written comments is treated as a request for records under 27 CFR 70.802(g).</P>
              <P>(v) To the extent resources permit, the public hearings to which this paragraph applies may be transcribed.</P>
              <P>(vi) In unusual circumstances or for good cause shown, the application of rules contained in this paragraph may be waived.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Comments on proposed rules.</E> Interested persons may submit data, views, or arguments with respect to a notice of proposed rulemaking published pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553. Procedures are provided in § 70.802(g) for members of the public to inspect and obtain copies of written comments submitted in response to proposed rules. All such comments are open in their entirety to public inspection. Therefore, the Bureau does not recognize any designation of material in comments as confidential or not to be disclosed, and any material that the commenter considers to be confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the public should not be included in his comments. The name of any person submitting comments or requesting a public hearing, the issues which may be discussed at the hearing, and outlines relating to the hearing are open to public disclosure. (See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for rules relating to hearing outlines.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Petition to change rules.</E> Interested persons may petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. A petition for the issuance of a rule shall identify the section or sections of law involved; and a petition for the amendment or repeal of a rule shall set forth the section or sections of the regulations involved. The petition shall set forth the reasons for the requested action. Such petitions shall be given careful consideration, and the petitioner shall be advised of the action taken thereon. Petitions must be addressed to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Washington, DC 20220. A petition to establish a new American viticultural area or to modify an existing American viticultural area is subject to the rules in part 9 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Publication of rules and regulations</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> All Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau regulations and amendments thereto are published as Treasury Decisions which appear in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> the Code of Federal Regulations, and the quarterly Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) Bulletin. The TTB Bulletin is the authoritative instrument of the Bureau for announcing Treasury decisions, legislation, administrative matters, and other items of general interest. The Bulletin incorporates, into one publication, all matters of the Bureau which are of public record. It is the policy of the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform application of all laws administered by the Bureau as well as rulings that supersede, revoke, modify, or amend any of those previously published in the Bulletin (including those published <PRTPAGE P="372"/>prior to July 1, 1972, in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). Procedures relating solely to matters of internal management are not published; however, regulations appearing in internal management documents and statements of internal practices and procedures that affect the rights and duties of the public are published. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Department of the Treasury Regulations, but they may be used as precedents. In applying published rulings and procedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered. Concerned parties are cautioned against reaching the same conclusion in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is published quarterly and may be obtained, on a subscription basis, from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Objectives and standards for publication of TTB Rulings and TTB Procedures in the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bulletin.</E> (i)(A) A “TTB Ruling” is an official interpretation by the Bureau that has been published in the Bulletin for the information and guidance of taxpayers, Bureau officers, and others concerned. TTB Rulings represent the conclusions of the Bureau on the application of the law to the entire state of facts involved. In those that are based on positions taken in rulings to industry members or technical advice to Bureau field offices, identifying details and confidential information are deleted to prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply with statutory requirements concerning disclosure of information obtained from the public.</P>
              <P>(B) A “TTB Procedure” is a statement of procedure that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or other members of the public under law and regulations administered by the Bureau or information that, although not necessarily affecting the rights and duties of the public, should be a matter of public knowledge. TTB Procedures establish methods for performing operations in compliance with the requirements of law and regulations. It is Bureau practice to publish as much of the internal management document or communication as is necessary for an understanding of the procedure. TTB Procedures may also be based on internal management documents which should be a matter of public knowledge even though not necessarily affecting the rights or duties of the public.</P>
              <P>(ii) It is the policy of the Bureau to publish in the Bulletin all rulings and other communications to members of the public or to Bureau field offices involving substantive law, procedures affecting taxpayer's rights or duties, or industry regulations, except those involving:</P>
              <P>(A) Issues specifically and clearly covered by statute or regulations;</P>
              <P>(B) Issues specifically covered by rulings, procedures, opinions, or court decisions previously published in the Bulletin;</P>
              <P>(C) Issues not likely to arise again because of unique or specific facts;</P>
              <P>(D) Determinations of fact rather than interpretations of law;</P>
              <P>(E) Acceptability under the law and regulations of containers, labels, and advertising involving alcoholic beverages;</P>
              <P>(F) Tobacco operations, such as the disposition of abandoned, seized, or condemned tobacco products;</P>
              <P>(G) Informers and informers' rewards; or</P>
              <P>(H) Disclosure of secret formulas, processes, business practices, and other similar information.</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) It is the practice of the Bureau to publish as much of the ruling or communication as is necessary for an understanding of the position stated. However, in order to prevent unwarranted invasions of personal privacy and to comply with statutory provisions, such as 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 26 U.S.C 6103 and 7213, dealing with disclosure of information obtained from members of the public, identifying details, including the names and addresses of persons involved, and information of a confidential nature are deleted from the ruling.</P>

              <P>(B) TTB Rulings published in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Department of the Treasury Regulations (including amendatory Treasury decisions) but are published <PRTPAGE P="373"/>to provide precedents to be used in the disposition of other cases, and may be cited and relied upon for that purpose. No unpublished ruling or decision may be relied on, used, or cited by any officer or employee of the Bureau as a precedent in the disposition of other cases.</P>
              <P>(C) Concerned persons generally may rely upon TTB Rulings published in the Bulletin in determining the Bureau treatment of their own transactions and need not request specific rulings applying the principles of a published TTB Ruling to the facts of their particular cases. However, since each TTB Ruling represents the conclusion of the Bureau as to the application of the law to the entire state of facts involved, taxpayers, Bureau personnel, and others concerned are cautioned against reaching the same conclusion in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. They should consider the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations, court decisions and TTB Rulings.</P>
              <P>(D) Comments and suggestions from taxpayers or other concerned persons on TTB Rulings being prepared for publication in the Bulletin may be solicited, if justified by special circumstances. Conferences on TTB Rulings being prepared for publication will not be granted except where the Bureau determines that such action is justified by special circumstances.</P>
              <P>(iv)(A) The appropriate TTB officer is responsible for administering the program for the publication of TTB Rulings and TTB Procedures in the Bulletin including the standards for style and format.</P>
              <P>(B) In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, each appropriate TTB officer is responsible for the preparation and appropriate referral for publication of TTB Rulings reflecting interpretations of substantive law made by his office and communicated in writing to members of the public or field offices. In this connection, the Chief Counsel is responsible for the referral to the appropriate TTB officer, for consideration for publication as TTB rulings, of interpretations of substantive law made by his office.</P>
              <P>(C) In accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the appropriate TTB officers and the Chief Counsel are responsible for determining whether procedures established by an office under their jurisdiction should be published as TTB Procedures and for the initiation, content, and appropriate referral for publication of such TTB Procedures.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 70.803</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Requests or demands for disclosure in testimony and in related matters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Authority.</E> The provisions of this section are prescribed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 301; section 2 of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1280); 12 U.S.C. 3412; 18 U.S.C. 1905; section 2(g) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 U.S.C. 202(c)); and sections 5274, 6103, 7213, 7803 and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5274, 6103, 7213, 7803 and 7805).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions apply whenever the defined terms appear in this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">TTB officer or employee.</E> The terms <E T="03">TTB officer</E> and <E T="03">TTB employee</E> mean all officers and employees of the United States, engaged in the administration and enforcement of laws administered by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and appointed or employed by, or subject to the directions, instructions or orders of, the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">TTB records or information.</E> The terms <E T="03">TTB records</E> and <E T="03">TTB information</E> mean any records (including copies thereof) or information, made or obtained by, furnished to, or coming to the knowledge of, any TTB officer or employee while acting in his official capacity, or because of his official status, with respect to the administration of laws administered by or concerning the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Demand.</E> The term <E T="03">demand</E> means any subpoena, notice of deposition either upon oral examination or written interrogatory, or other order, of any court, administrative agency, or other authority.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Disclosure of TTB records or information prohibited without prior approval of the appropriate TTB officer.</E> The disclosure, including the production, of TTB records or information to any person outside the Department of the Treasury or to any court, administrative agency, or other authority, in response to any request or demand for the disclosure of such records or information shall be made only with the prior approval of the appropriate TTB officer. However, nothing in this section restricts the disclosure of TTB records or information for which the appropriate TTB officer has determined that the disclosure is authorized under any provision of statute, Executive order, or regulations, or for which a procedure has been established by the Administrator. For example, this section does not restrict the disclosure of TTB records or information under <PRTPAGE P="376"/>§ 71.22, nor does it restrict the disclosure of TTB records or information which is requested by U.S. attorneys or attorneys of the Department of Justice for use in cases which arise under the laws administered by or concerning the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and which are referred by the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice for prosecution or defense.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Delegation of authority to determine disclosure and establish procedures.</E> The appropriate TTB officer is hereby authorized to determine whether or not TTB officers and employees will be permitted to disclose TTB records or information in response to:</P>
              <P>(1) A request by any court, administrative agency, or other authority, or by any person, for the disclosure of such records or information; or</P>
              <P>(2) A demand for the disclosure of such records or information.</P>
              <P>(3) The Administrator is also authorized to establish such other procedures as he or she may deem necessary with respect to the disclosure of TTB records or information by TTB officers and employees. Any determination by the appropriate TTB officer as to whether TTB records or information will be disclosed, or any procedure established by the Administrator in connection therewith, must be made in accordance with applicable statutes, Executive orders, regulations, and any instructions that may be issued by the Secretary. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the appropriate TTB officer shall, where either the Secretary or such officer deems it appropriate, refer the opposing of a request or demand for disclosure of TTB records or information to the Secretary.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Procedure in the event of a request or demand for TTB records or information</E>—(1) <E T="03">Request procedure.</E> Any TTB officer or employee who receives a request for TTB records or information, the disposition of which is not covered by a procedure established by the Administrator, must promptly communicate the contents of the request to the appropriate TTB officer. The officer or employee must await instructions from the appropriate TTB officer concerning the response to the request.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Demand procedure.</E> Any TTB officer or employee who is served with a demand for TTB records or information, the disposition of which is not covered by a procedure established by the Administrator, must promptly, and without awaiting appearance before the court, administrative agency, or other authority, communicate the contents of the demand to the appropriate TTB officer. The TTB officer or employee must await instructions from the appropriate TTB officer concerning the response to the demand. If it is determined by the appropriate TTB officer that the demand should be opposed, the U.S. attorney, his or her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative shall be requested to respectfully inform the court, administrative agency, or other authority that the appropriate TTB officer has instructed the TTB officer or employee to refuse to disclose the TTB records or information sought. If instructions have not been received from the appropriate TTB officer at the time when the TTB officer or employee is required to appear before the court, administrative agency, or other authority in response to the demand, the U.S. attorney, his or her assistant, or other appropriate legal representative must be requested to appear with the TTB officer or employee upon whom the demand has been served and request additional time in which to receive such instructions. In the event the court, administrative agency, or other authority rules adversely with respect to the refusal to disclose the records or information pursuant to the instructions of the appropriate TTB officer, or declines to defer a ruling until instructions from the appropriate TTB officer have been received, the TTB officer or employee upon whom the demand has been served must, pursuant to this section, respectfully decline to disclose the TTB records or information sought.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Affidavit required for testimony.</E> If testimony of an TTB officer or employee is sought by a request or demand on behalf of a party other than a State in any case or matter in which the United States is not a party, an affidavit, or if that is not feasible, a statement shall be submitted. The affidavit or statement shall be prepared by <PRTPAGE P="377"/>the party (or party's attorney) seeking the testimony, and shall set forth a summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the proceedings. The affidavit or statement must be submitted before permission to testify may be granted. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Time limit for serving request or demand.</E> The request or demand, together with the affidavit or statement (if required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section), must be served at least 5 working days prior to the scheduled date of testimony or disclosure of records, in order to ensure that the appropriate TTB officer has adequate time to consider whether to grant the request or demand. The appropriate TTB officer may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Factors to be considered in determining whether a request or demand will be granted.</E> The appropriate TTB officer must consider whether granting the request or demand would be appropriate under the relevant rules of procedure and substantive law concerning privilege. Among the requests or demands that will not be granted are those that would, if granted, result in—</P>
              <P>(i) The violation of a statute, such as 26 U.S.C. 6103 or 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule (F.R.Cr.P. Rule 6(e)), or a specific regulation;</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclosure of classified information;</P>
              <P>(iii) The disclosure of a confidential source or informant, unless the TTB officer or employee and the source or informant, have no objection;</P>
              <P>(iv) The disclosure of investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes if enforcement proceedings would thereby be impeded, or of investigative techniques and procedures whose effectiveness would thereby be impaired, unless the appropriate TTB officer determines that the administration of justice requires disclosure;</P>
              <P>(v) The disclosure of trade secrets without the owner's consent; or</P>
              <P>(vi) Testimony in a case in which TTB has no interest, records or other official information.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">State cases.</E> The appropriate TTB officer, may, in the interest of Federal and State law enforcement, upon receipt of demands or requests of State authorities, and at the expense of the State, authorize employees under their supervision to attend trials and administrative hearings in liquor, tobacco, firearms, or explosives cases in which the State is a party or on behalf of the State in any criminal case, to produce records, and to testify as to facts coming to their knowledge in their official capacities. However, in cases where a defendant in a criminal case requests or demands testimony or the production of TTB records or information, authorization from the appropriate TTB officer is required. Production or testimony may not divulge information contrary to 26 U.S.C. 6103 and 7213, or 12 U.S.C. 3412. See also 18 U.S.C. 1905.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Penalties.</E> Any TTB officer or employee who disobeys the provisions of this section will be subject to dismissal and may incur criminal liability.</P>

The administrative law judge shall have the right in his discretion to limit the number of witnesses whose testimony may be merely cumulative and shall, as a matter of policy, not only exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence but shall also limit the cross-examination of witnesses to reasonable bounds so as not to unnecessarily prolong the hearing and unduly burden the record. Material and relevant evidence shall not be excluded, because it is not the best evidence, unless its authenticity is challenged, in which case reasonable time shall be given to establish its authenticity. When portions only of a document are to be relied upon, the offering party shall prepare the pertinent excerpts, adequately identified, and <PRTPAGE P="390"/>shall supply copies of such excerpts, together with a statement indicating the purpose for which such materials will be offered, to the administrative law judge and to the other parties. Only the excerpts, so prepared and submitted, shall be received in the record. However, the whole of the original document should be made available for examination and for use by opposing counsel for purposes of cross-examination. Compilations, charts, summaries of data and photostatic copies of documents may be admitted in evidence if the proceedings will thereby be expedited, and if the material upon which they are based is available for examination by the parties. Objections to the evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied upon. The transcript shall not include argument or debate on objections, except as ordered by the administrative law judge, but shall include the rulings thereon.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Statement regarding knowledge of seizure.</E> In the event the petition is filed for the restoration of the proceeds derived from sale of the property or carrier pursuant to summary forfeiture, it should also contain, or be supported by, satisfactory proof that <PRTPAGE P="402"/>the petitioner did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or condemnation of forfeiture, and that he was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of the same. (See also § 72.35.)</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Interest of petitioner.</E> The petitioner should state in clear and concise terms the nature and amount of the present interest of the petitioner in the property or carrier, and the facts relied upon to show that the forfeiture was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention upon the part of the petitioner to defraud the revenue or to violate the law, or such other mitigating circumstances as, in the opinion of the petitioner, would justify the remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Petitioner innocent party.</E> If the petitioner is not the one who in person committed the act which caused the seizure the petition should state how the property or carrier came into the possession of such other person, and that the petitioner had no knowledge or reason to believe, if such be the fact, that the property or carrier would be used in violation of law. If known to the petitioner, at the time the petition is filed, that such other person had either a record or a reputation, or both, as a violator in the field of commercial crime, the petition should state whether the petitioner had actual knowledge of such record or reputation, or both, before the petitioner acquired his interest in the property or carrier, before such other person acquired his right in the property or carrier, whichever occurred later. When personal property is seized for violation of the liquor laws, the determining factor will be whether the person dealt with by the petitioner had either a record or a reputation, or both, as a violator of the liquor laws.</P>

              <P>(f) <E T="03">Costs.</E> The petition should also contain an undertaking to pay the costs, if costs are assessed as a condition of allowance of the petition. Costs shall include all the expenses incurred in seizing and storing the property or carrier; the costs borne or to be borne by the United States; the taxes, if any, payable by the petitioner or imposed in respect of the property or carrier to which the petition relates; the penalty, if any, asserted by the Director; and, if the property or carrier has been sold, or is in the course of being sold, the expenses so incurred.</P>
