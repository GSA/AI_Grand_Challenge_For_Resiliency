      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The Delaware River Basin Compact requires the Commission to formulate and adopt a Comprehensive Plan and Water Resources Program. In addition, the Compact provides in Section 3.8 that no project having a substantial effect on the water resources of the Basin shall be undertaken unless it shall have been first submitted to and approved by the Commission. The Commission is required to approve a project whenever it finds and determines that such project would not substantially impair or conflict with the Comprehensive Plan. Section 3.8 further provides that the Commission shall provide by regulation for the procedure of submission, review and consideration of projects and for its determinations pursuant to Section 3.8.</P>
            <P>(b) The Comprehensive Plan consists of all public and those private projects and facilities which the Commission has directed be included therein. It also includes those documents and policies which the Commission has determined should be included with the Comprehensive Plan as being needed to insure optimum planning, development, conservation, use, management and control of the water resources of the Delaware Basin to meet present and future needs. The Comprehensive Plan is subject to periodic review and revision as provided in Sections 3.2 and 13.1 of the Compact.</P>
            <P>(c) The Water Resources Program is based upon the Comprehensive Plan. It is required to be updated annually and to include a systematic presentation of the quantity and quality of water resources needs of the area to be served for such reasonably foreseeable period as the Commission may determine, balanced by existing and proposed projects required to satisfy such needs. The Commission's review and modification of the Water Resources Program is conducted pursuant to the provisions of Articles 3.2 and 13.2 of the Compact.</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure govern the adoption and revision of the Comprehensive Plan, the Water Resources Program, the exercise of the Commission's authority pursuant to the provisions of Article 3.8 and other actions of the Commission mandated or authorized by the Compact.</P>

            <P>(e) These Rules of Practice and Procedure extend to the following areas of Commission responsibility and regulation:

The Commission reserves the right to waive any Rule of Practice and Procedure it determines should not be applicable in connection with any matter requiring Commission action. All actions by the Commission, however, shall comply fully with the applicable provisions of the Compact.</P>

              <P>(a) The Comprehensive Plan shall be adopted, revised and modified as provided in Sections 3.2 and 13.1 of the Compact. It is the Commission's responsibility to adopt the Comprehensive Plan, after consultation with water users and interested public bodies, for the immediate and long-range development and uses of the water resources of the Basin. The Plan shall include the public and private projects and facilities which the Commission determines are required for the optimum planning, development, conservation, utilization, management and control of the water resources of the Basin to meet present and future needs. In addition to the included projects and facilities, the Comprehensive Plan consists of the statements of policies, and programs that the Commission determines are necessary to govern the proper development and use of the River Basin. The documents within the Comprehensive Plan expressing the Commission's policies and programs for the future, including the means for carrying them out, may be set forth through narrative text, maps, charts, schedules, budgets and other appropriate means.</P>
              <P>(b) Specific projects and facilities and statements of policy and programs may be incorporated, deleted or modified from time to time to reflect changing conditions, research results and new technology. The degree of detail described in particular projects may vary depending upon the status of their development.</P>

              <P>(a) After a project of any federal, state or local agency has been included in the Comprehensive Plan, no further action will be required by the Commission or by the agency to satisfy the requirements of Article 11 of the Compact, except as the Comprehensive Plan may be amended or revised pursuant to the Compact and this part. Any project which is changed substantially from the project as described in the Comprehensive Plan will be deemed to be a new and different project for the purposes of Article 11 of the Compact. Whenever a change is made the sponsor shall advise the Executive Director who will determine whether the change is deemed substantial within the meaning of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Any public project not having a substantial effect on the water resources of the Basin, as defined in subpart C of this part, may proceed without reference to Article 11 of the Compact.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section applies to all projects that:</P>
              <P>(1) Are reviewable under the Compact;</P>

              <P>(2) Meet the thresholds for review set forth in § 401.35 of these <E T="03">Rules of Practice and Procedure;</E>
              </P>
              <P>(3) Are subject to review by a Signatory Party Agency under its own statutory authorities; and</P>
              <P>(4) Are within regulatory programs that have been identified in a duly adopted Administrative Agreement between the Commission and a Signatory Party Agency under this section. For any project that requires an approval under the Compact that is outside the scope of the Signatory Party Agency's approval issued in accordance with an Administrative Agreement under this section, the project sponsor shall apply to the Commission in accordance with procedures established by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Regulatory programs.</E> Regulatory programs eligible for administration under the One Permit Program may include but are not limited to those concerning: Basin discharges, Basin water withdrawals, and Basin flood plain requirements.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> The categories of projects covered and the procedures for processing applications under the One Permit Program shall be set forth in one or more Administrative Agreements between the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency that have been adopted by the Commission following a duly noticed public hearing and are in form and substance acceptable to the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency, consistent with the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section or in an Administrative Agreement that has been duly executed by the Commission and the Signatory Party Agency under this section, an application for initial approval, renewal or revision of any project subject to the One Permit Program shall be filed only with the Signatory Party Agency.</P>
              <P>(2) To enable the Commission to compile and make available to the public a current list of pending applications for projects within the Basin subject to Commission jurisdiction, the Signatory Party Agency shall notify the Commission at least monthly of applications the Signatory Party has received during the preceding month that may be eligible for review under the One Permit Program.</P>
              <P>(3) For those categories of projects identified in the Administrative Agreement as requiring Commission input, the Commission staff shall provide the Signatory Party Agency with such input, including where specified by the Administrative Agreement, a recommendation as to any conditions of approval that may be necessary or appropriate to include in the project review determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact as to those regulatory programs identified in an Administrative Agreement in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) Unless the Signatory Party Agency disapproves the project or the Administrative Agreement provides for separate Commission action under Section 3.8 of the Compact, the Signatory Party Agency shall make the project review determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact, as specified in the Administrative Agreement, as to the regulatory program covered by the Signatory Party Agency's approval and include the determination and any associated conditions of approval within the permit or other approval instrument that it issues to the project sponsor. If in accordance with the applicable Administrative Agreement the determination under Section 3.8 of the Compact is made by the Commission, the Signatory Party Agency may include the determination together with any associated conditions of approval in its permit or other approval instrument covering the project.</P>
              <P>(5) The Commission will maintain on its Web site a list of all projects being administered pursuant to the Program.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Comprehensive Plan projects.</E> Articles 11 and 13 of the Compact require certain projects to be included in the Comprehensive Plan. To add a project not yet included in the Comprehensive Plan, the project sponsor shall submit a separate application to the Commission. If following its review and public hearing the Commission approves the <PRTPAGE P="16"/>addition of the project to the Comprehensive Plan, the Commission's approval will include such project requirements as are necessary under the Compact and Commission regulations. All other project approvals that may be required from the Signatory Party Agency or the Commission under regulatory programs administered pursuant to this section may be issued through the One Permit Program. An application for renewal or modification of a project in the Comprehensive Plan that does not change the project so substantially as to render it a new and different project may be submitted only to the Signatory Party Agency unless otherwise specified in the Administrative Agreement.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Retention of Commission review and enforcement authorities.</E> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any Commissioner or the Executive Director may designate for Commission review any project that is reviewable under the Compact. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Commission to exercise its review authority under the Compact and applicable Commission regulations. Similarly, although Administrative Agreements executed pursuant to this section may include collaborative and cooperative compliance and enforcement procedures, nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Commission to exercise its enforcement authority under the Compact and applicable regulations.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Exhaustion of Signatory Party administrative remedies prerequisite to appeal.</E> Before commencing an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction challenging any final action taken by a Signatory Party Agency under this section, the appellant must first exhaust its administrative remedies under the law of the Signatory Party whose agency issued the decision at issue.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Fees.</E> The Commission shall establish and maintain a schedule of fees for any or all of the services it renders pursuant to this section. The applicable fee(s) for Commission services rendered pursuant to this section shall be those set forth in DRBC Resolution No. 2009-2 (available at <E T="03">http://www.nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/Res2009-2.pdf</E>) for the review and renewal of project approvals. Project sponsors shall pay such fees, if any, directly to the Commission in accordance with the current schedule and applicable rules.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Effect of One Permit Program on Commission dockets.</E> (1) Unless the Executive Director or Commission otherwise directs, if a docket holder submits, or has submitted, a timely application to a Signatory Party Agency for a project subject to review under an Administrative Agreement duly adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, the most recent docket for the project shall, upon expiration, be deemed administratively continued until final action is taken in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Unless the Executive Director or Commission otherwise directs, upon a Signatory Party Agency's final action on an application for a project subject to the One Permit Program:</P>
              <P>(i) Any existing or administratively continued docket for such project shall terminate as to all of its provisions and conditions that pertain to regulatory programs administered by the Signatory Party Agency under the Administrative Agreement (“the Covered Programs”); and</P>
              <P>(ii) The docket shall continue in effect as to any provisions and conditions not pertaining only to Covered Programs, including, as applicable, the incorporation of the project in the Commission's Comprehensive Plan.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Modification of rules of practice and procedure to conform to this section.</E> Any project subject to review under an Administrative Agreement duly adopted under paragraph (d) of this section, shall be governed by this section and not §§ 401.4, 401.5, 401.6, 401.8, 401.34(a), (c) and (e), 401.37, 401.38 and 18 CFR part 401, subpart F, where they are inconsistent with the procedures provided in this section.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">No interference with Supreme Court decree.</E> In accordance with Sections 3.3(a) and 3.5 of the Compact, nothing in this section shall grant the authority to any Signatory Party Agency to impair, diminish or otherwise adversely affect the diversions, compensating releases, rights, conditions, obligations and provisions for administration thereof provided in the United <PRTPAGE P="17"/>States Supreme Court decree in <E T="03">New Jersey</E> v.<E T="03"> New York,</E> 347 U.S. 995 (1954) (“Decree”). Any such action shall be taken only by the Commission with the unanimous consent of the parties to the Decree or upon unanimous consent of the members of the Commission following a declaration of a state of emergency in accordance with Section 3.3(a) of the Compact.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 401.43</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Regulatory program fees.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The purpose of this section is to provide an adequate, stable and reliable stream of revenue to cover the cost of the Commission's regulatory program activities, an important means by which the Commission coordinates management of the shared water resources of the Basin. Activities to be covered by the fees include the review of applications for projects that are subject to review under the Delaware River Basin Compact and implementing regulations; and ongoing activities associated with such projects, including but not limited to, effluent and ambient monitoring, data analysis, hydrodynamic and water quality modeling, and coordination with state and federal agencies.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Types of fees.</E> The following types of fees are established by this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Docket application fee.</E> Except as set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the docket application fee shall apply to:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Project requiring a DRBC-issued docket or permit.</E> Any project that, in accordance with the Delaware River Basin Compact and DRBC regulations, requires a Commission-issued docket or permit, whether it be a new or existing project for which the Commission has not yet issued an approval or a project for which the renewal of a previous Commission approval is required.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Project requiring inclusion in the comprehensive plan.</E> Any project that in accordance with section 11 or section 13.1 of the <E T="03">Delaware River Basin Compact</E> and DRBC regulations must be added to the Comprehensive Plan (also, “Plan”). In addition to any new project required to be included in the Plan, such projects include existing projects that in accordance with section 13.1 of the <E T="03">Compact</E> are required to be included in the Plan and which were not previously added to the Plan. Any existing project that is changed substantially from the project as described in the Plan shall be deemed to be a new and different project for purposes of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Exemptions.</E> The docket application fee shall not apply to:</P>
              <P>(A) Any project for which the Signatory Party Agency serves as lead under the One Permit Program rule (§ 401.42), unless such project must be added by the Commission to the Comprehensive Plan.</P>
              <P>(B) Any project for which an agency, authority or commission of a signatory to the Compact is the primary sponsor. Projects sponsored by political subdivisions of the signatory states shall not be included in this exemption. For purposes of this section “political subdivisions” shall include without limitation municipalities, municipal utility authorities, municipal development corporations, and all other entities not directly under the budgetary and administrative control of the Commission's members.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Annual monitoring and coordination fee.</E> (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, an annual monitoring and coordination fee shall apply to each active water allocation or wastewater discharge approval issued pursuant to the <E T="03">Compact</E> and implementing regulations, regardless of whether the approval was issued by the Commission in the form of a docket, permit or other instrument, or by a Signatory Party Agency under the One Permit Program rule (§ 401.42). The fee shall be based on the amount of a project's approved monthly water allocation and/or approved daily discharge capacity.</P>
              <P>(ii) For any withdrawal or diversion covered in part by a certificate of entitlement issued pursuant to §§ 420.31 and 420.32 of the water supply charges regulations (18 CFR part 420), the annual monitoring and coordination fee shall be based on the allocated amount, if any, in excess of the quantity specified in the entitlement.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alternative review fee.</E> In instances where the Commission's activities and related costs associated with the review of an existing or proposed project <PRTPAGE P="18"/>are expected to involve extraordinary time and expense, an alternative review fee equal to the Commission's actual costs may be imposed. The Executive Director shall inform the project sponsor in writing when the alternative review fee is to be applied and may require advance payment in the amount of the Commission's projected costs. Instances in which the alternative review fee may apply include, but are not limited to, matters in which:</P>
              <P>(i) DRBC staff perform a detailed pre-application review, including but not limited to the performance or review of modeling and/or analysis to identify target limits for wastewater discharges.</P>
              <P>(ii) DRBC staff perform or review complex modeling in connection with the design of a wastewater discharge diffuser system.</P>
              <P>(iii) DRBC manages a public process for which the degree of public involvement results in extraordinary effort and expense, including but not limited to, costs associated with multiple stakeholder meetings, special public hearings, and/or voluminous public comment.</P>
              <P>(iv) DRBC conducts or is required to engage third parties to conduct additional analyses or evaluations of a project in response to a court order.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Additional fees</E>—(i) <E T="03">Emergency approval.</E> A request for an emergency certificate under § 401.40 to waive or amend a docket condition shall be subject to a minimum fee in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. An alternative review fee also may be charged in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Late filed renewal application.</E> Any renewal application submitted fewer than 120 calendar days in advance of the expiration date or after such other date specified in the docket or permit or letter of the Executive Director for filing a renewal application shall be subject to a late filed renewal application charge in excess of the otherwise applicable fee.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Modification of a DRBC approval.</E> Following Commission action on a project, each project revision or modification that the Executive Director deems substantial shall require an additional docket application fee calculated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and subject to an alternative review fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Name change.</E> Each project with a docket or permit issued by the DRBC or by a Signatory Party Agency pursuant to the One Permit Program rule (§ 401.42) will be charged an administrative fee as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Change of ownership.</E> Each project that undergoes a “change in ownership” as that term is defined at 18 CFR 420.31(e)(2) will be charged an administrative fee as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Indexed adjustment.</E> On July 1 of every year, beginning July 1, 2017, all fees established by this section will increase commensurate with any increase in the annual April 12-month Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Philadelphia, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics during that year.<SU>1</SU>

                <FTREF/> In any year in which the April 12-month CPI for Philadelphia declines or shows no change, the docket application fee and annual monitoring and coordination fee will remain unchanged. Following any indexed adjustment made under this paragraph (c), a revised fee schedule will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> by July 1 and posted on the Commission's Web site. Interested parties may also obtain the fee schedule by contacting the Commission directly during business hours.</P>

              <P>The Executive Director shall serve notice of an action or decision by him under the regulations in this chapter by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. The affected discharger shall be entitled (and the <PRTPAGE P="20"/>notice of action or decision shall so state) to show cause at a Commission hearing why such action or decision should not take effect. A request for such a hearing shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission not more than 30 days after service of the Executive Director's determination. Failure to file such a request within the time limit shall be deemed to be an acceptance of the Executive Director's determination and a waiver of any further hearing.</P>

It may be stated in such detail as the objector may elect. The request shall be deemed filed only upon receipt by the Commission.</P>
              <P>(b) Whenever the Executive Director determines that the request for a hearing is insufficient to identify the nature and scope of the objection, or that one or more issues may be resolved, reduced or identified by such action, he may require the objector to prepare and submit to the Commission, within such reasonable time (not less than 30 days) as he may specify, a technical report of the facts relating to the objection prior to the scheduling of the hearing. The report shall be required by notice in writing served upon the objector by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person or entity filing the request for hearing at the place indicated in the request.</P>

              <P>(1) A specification with particularity of the ground or grounds for the objection; and failure to specify a ground for objection prior to the hearing shall foreclose the objector from thereafter asserting such a ground at the hearing;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of industrial processing and waste treatment operational characteristics and outfall configuration in such detail as to permit an evaluation of the character, kind and quantity of the discharges, both treated and untreated, including the physical, chemical and biological properties of any liquid, gaseous, solid, radioactive, or other substance composing the discharge in whole or in part;</P>
              <P>(3) The thermal characteristics of the discharges and the level of heat in flow;</P>
              <P>(4) Information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation in depth of any in-plant control or recovery process for which credit is claimed;</P>
              <P>(5) The chemical and toxicological characteristics including the processes and/or indirect discharges which may be the source of the chemicals or toxicity;</P>

              <P>(7) Measurements of the waste as closely as possible to the processes where the wastes are produced, with the sample composited either continually or at frequent intervals (one-half hour or, where permitted by the Executive Director, one hour periods), so as to represent adequately the strength and volume of waste that is discharged; and</P>
              <P>(8) Such other and additional specific technical data as the Executive Director may reasonably consider necessary and useful for the proper determination of a wasteload allocation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hearings generally.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope of subpart.</E> This subpart shall apply to contested cases required to be held under subparts C and E of this part, to the conduct of other administrative hearings involving contested cases and to proceedings which Commission regulation or the Commission directs be conducted pursuant to this subpart.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definition of contested case.</E> “Contested case” means a proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other legal relations of specific parties are involved. Such a proceeding may involve personnel matters, project applications and docket decisions but shall not extend to the review of any proposed or adopted rule or regulation of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requests for hearings.</E> Any person seeking a hearing to review the action or decision of the Commission or the Executive Director may request a hearing pursuant to the provisions of this subpart provided such a request is received by the Commission within thirty (30) days of the action or decision which is the subject of the requested hearing. Requests shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Commission and shall identify the specific action or decision for which a hearing is requested, the date of the action or decision, the interest of the person requesting the hearing in the subject matter of the proposed hearing and a summary statement setting forth the basis for objecting to or seeking review of the action or decision. Any request filed more than thirty days after an action or decision will be deemed untimely and such request for a hearing shall be considered denied unless the Commission by unanimous vote otherwise directs. Receipt of requests for <PRTPAGE P="22"/>hearings, pursuant to this subpart, whether timely filed or not, shall be submitted by the Secretary to the Commissioners for their information.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional joint hearings.</E> Whenever designated by a department, agency or instrumentality of a signatory party, and within any limitations prescribed by the designation, a Hearing Officer designated pursuant to this subpart may also serve as a Hearing Officer, examiner or agent pursuant to such additional designation and may conduct joint hearings for the Commission and for such other department, agency or instrumentality. Pursuant to the additional designation, a Hearing Officer shall cause to be filed with the department, agency or instrumentality making the designation, a certified copy of the transcript of the evidence taken before him and, if requested, of his findings and recommendations. Neither the Hearing Officer nor the Delaware River Basin Commission shall have or exercise any power or duty as a result of such additional designation to decide the merits of any matter arising under the separate laws of a signatory party (other than the Delaware River Basin Compact).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Schedule.</E> The Executive Director shall cause the schedule for each hearing to be listed in advance upon a “hearing docket” which shall be posted in public view at the office of the Commission.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Notice of hearing.</E> Notice of any hearing to be conducted pursuant to this subpart shall comply with the provisions of Section 14.4(b) of the Compact relating to public notice unless otherwise directed by the Commission.</P>

Thereafter, the Executive Director shall present the request for a hearing to the Commission for its consideration. The Commission shall grant a request for a hearing pursuant to this subpart if it determines that an adequate record with regard to the action or decision is not available, the contested case involves a determination by the Executive Director or staff which requires further action by the Commission or that the Commission has found that an administrative hearing is necessary or desirable. If the Commission denies any request for a hearing in a contested case, the party seeking such a hearing shall be limited to such remedies as may be provided by the Compact or other applicable law or court rule.</P>

              <P>(2) Cause each witness to be sworn or to make affirmation.</P>
              <P>(3) Limit the number of times any witness may testify, limit repetitious examination or cross-examination of witnesses or the extent to which corroborative or cumulative testimony shall be accepted.</P>
              <P>(4) Exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence, but the interested parties shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received.</P>

              <P>(3) Whether the violation caused adverse environmental consequences and the extent of any harm;</P>
              <P>(4) The costs incurred by the Commission or any signatory party relating to the failure to comply with the Commission's Compact and regulations;</P>
              <P>(5) The extent to which the violator has cooperated with the Commission in correcting the violation and remediating any adverse consequences or harm that resulted therefrom; and</P>
              <P>(6) Whether the failure to comply with the Commission's Compact and regulations was economically beneficial to the violator.</P>
              <P>(b) The Commission retains the right to waive any penalty or reduce the amount of the penalty should it determine that, after consideration of the factors in paragraph (a) of this section, extenuating circumstances justify such action.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Settlement by agreement in lieu of penalty.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A possible violator may request settlement of a penalty proceeding by agreement. If the Executive Director determines that settlement by agreement in lieu of a penalty is in the best interest of the Commission, he may submit to the Commission a proposed settlement agreement in lieu of a penalty. No settlement will be considered by the Commission unless the possible violator has indicated to the Commission acceptance of the terms of the agreement and the intention to comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement including payment of any settlement amount within the time period provided. If the Commission determines not to approve a settlement agreement, the Commission may proceed with a penalty action in accordance with this subpart.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Filing a request for records.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All requests for Commission records shall be filed in writing delivered to the FOIA Officer, or by mailing it to the Commission. The Commission will supply forms for written requests.</P>
              <P>(b) A request for Commission records shall reasonably describe the records being sought, in a way that they can be identified and located. A request should include all pertinent details that will help identify the records sought. A person requesting disclosure of records shall be permitted an opportunity to review them without the necessity for copying them where the records involved contain only disclosable data and information.</P>
              <P>(1) If the description is insufficient to locate the records requested, the FOIA Officer will so notify the person making the request and indicate the additional information needed to identify the records requested.</P>
              <P>(2) Every reasonable effort shall be made by the staff to assist in the identification and location of the records sought.</P>
              <P>(3) In any situation in which it is determined that a request for voluminous records would unduly burden and interfere with the operations of the Commission, the person making the request will be asked to be more specific and to narrow the request, and to agree on an orderly procedure for the production of the requested records.</P>

              <P>(c) Upon receipt of a request for records, the FOIA Officer shall enter it in a public log (which entry may consist of a copy of the request). The log shall state the date and time received, the name and address of the person <PRTPAGE P="28"/>making the request, the nature of the records requested, the action taken on the request, the date of the determination letter sent pursuant to § 401.99(b), the date(s) any records are subsequently furnished, the number of staff-hours and grade levels of persons who spent time responding to the request, and the payment requested and received.</P>
              <P>(d) A denial of a request for records, in whole or in part, shall be signed by the FOIA Officer. The name and title or position of each person who participated in the denial of a request for records shall be set forth in a letter denying the request. This requirement may be met by attaching a list of such individuals to the letter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Time limitations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All time limitations established pursuant to this section shall begin as of the time at which a request for records is logged in by the FOIA Officer pursuant to § 401.98(c). An oral request for records shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent elsewhere within the Commission shall not begin any time requirement until it is redirected to the FOIA Officer and is logged in accordance with § 401.98(c). A request that is expected to involve fees in excess of $50 will not be deemed received until the requester is promptly notified and agrees to bear the cost or has so indicated on his request.</P>
              <P>(b) Within ten (10) working days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after a request for records is logged by the FOIA Officer, the record shall be furnished or a letter shall be sent to the person making the request determining whether, or the extent to which, the Commission will comply with the request, and, if any records are denied, the reasons therefor.</P>
              <P>(1) If all of the records requested have been located and a final determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall so state.</P>
              <P>(2) If all of the records have not been located or a final determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the letter shall state the extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the rules established in this part.</P>
              <P>(3) In the following unusual circumstances, the time for sending this letter may be extended by the Executive Director for up to an additional ten (10) working days by written notice to the person making the request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the time within which a determination is expected to be dispatched:</P>
              <P>(i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the Commission's Headquarters.</P>
              <P>(ii) The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request.</P>
              <P>(iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the Commission having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>

              <P>(c) If any record is denied, the letter shall state the right of the person requesting such records to appeal any adverse determination to the Executive Director of the Commission. Such an appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days from receipt of the FOIA Officer's determination denying the requested information (where the entire request has been denied), or from the receipt of any information made available pursuant to the request (where the request has been denied in part). Within twenty (20) working days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after receipt of any appeal, or any authorized extension, the Executive Director or his designee shall make a determination and notify the appellant of his determination. If the appeal is decided in favor of the appellant the requested information shall be promptly supplied as provided in this part. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is upheld in whole or in part, the appellant shall be entitled to appeal to the Commission at its next regular meeting. In the event that the Commission confirms the Executive <PRTPAGE P="29"/>Director's denial the appellant shall be notified of the provisions for judicial review.</P>
              <P>(d) If the request for records will result in a fee of more than $25, determination letter under § 401.99 shall specify or estimate the fee involved and may require prepayment, as well as payment of any amount not yet received as a result of any previous request, before the records are made available. If the fee is less than $25, prepayment shall not be required unless payment has not yet been received for records disclosed as a result of a previous request.</P>
              <P>(e) Whenever possible, the determination letter required under § 401.99(b), relating to a request for records that involves a fee of less than $25.00, shall be accompanied by the requested records. Where this is not possible, the records shall be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter. For requests for records involving a fee of more than $25.00, the records shall be forwarded as soon as possible after receipt of payment.</P>

              <P>(b) In order to protect the public interest, the following principles and goals have been determined:</P>
              <P>(1) The overall goal is prudent land use within the physical and environmental constraints of the site.</P>
              <P>(2) The principle of equal and uniform treatment shall apply to all flood plain users who are similarly situated.</P>

              <P>(a) Standards used by state and local governments shall conform in principle to Commission standards but may vary in detail provided that resulting flood plain use will not be less restrictive than would result from the application of Commission standards. The Commission will review proposed state and local flood plain regulations to determine their compliance with Commission standards.</P>
              <P>(b) Because of the variety and diversity of presently recognized hydrologic procedures, no one procedure or method is prescribed for determining the peak flow in cubic feet per second for the 100-year storm (Q 100) on which profiles for the delineation of flood hazard areas are based. The following may be used:</P>

              <FP>State and local agencies may use methods resulting in Q 100s which are in reasonable agreement with those of the Commission. Any significant difference shall be reviewed with and subject to approval by the Executive Director.</FP>

              <P>(c) Methods and procedures shall be uniform, so far as practicable, within sub-basins which have a major effect on the larger basins of which they are <PRTPAGE P="39"/>a part. To assist in achieving this objective the Commission staff will periodically provide to the various interested governmental agencies and others Q 100 data as developed by the Delaware River Basin Commission Hydrology Coordinating Committee for key locations in the Delaware River Basin. These will be based on a Log Pearson Type 3 analysis of data from the U.S.G.S. gaging stations using station skew, regional skew, or weighted skew, depending on the scope of data at each station.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Exempt uses under the Compact.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Section 15.1(b) of the Delaware River Basin Compact provides that “no provision of section 3.7 of the Compact shall be deemed to authorize the Commission to impose any charge for water withdrawals or diversions from the basin if such withdrawals or diversions could lawfully have been made without charge on the effective date of the Compact; * * *” In compliance with this provision: There shall be no charge for water withdrawn or diverted in quantities not exceeding the legal entitlement of the user, determined as of October 27, 1961. Each water user may submit proof satisfactory to the Commission of the factors constituting legal entitlement, as defined in paragraph (b) thereof. In the absence of such proof of these conditions as of October 27, 1961, the quantity of water exempt from charge to each user will be the legal entitlement of the user determined as of March 31, 1971.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Legal entitlement</E> means the quantity or volume of water expressed in million gallons per month determined by the lesser of the following conditions:</P>

              <P>(i) A valid and subsisting permit, issued under the authority of one of the signatory parties, if such permit was required as of October 27, 1961, or thereafter;<PRTPAGE P="41"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Physical capability as required for such taking; or</P>
              <P>(iii) The total allocable flow without augmentation by the Commission, using a seven-day, ten-year, low-flow criterion measured at the point of withdrawal or diversion.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Physical capability</E> means the capacity of pumps, water lines and appurtenances installed and operable, determined according to sound engineering principles. The physical capability specifically includes plant facilities actually using water, but excludes facilities which may have been installed in anticipation of future plant expansion not yet realized.</P>
              <P>(c) Whenever adequate records of legal entitlement for agricultural irrigation purposes are not available to the Commission, such legal entitlement shall be measured by the maximum number of acres under irrigation by the water user at any time during the year ending March 31, 1971, allowing one acre-foot of surface water annually per acre irrigated.</P>
              <P>(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, there shall be no charge for water made available from storage where:</P>
              <P>(1) The cost of the storage facility has or will be otherwise paid for by the user,</P>
              <P>(2) Such storage controls a drainage area, and</P>
              <P>(3) The use does not exceed the yield of such storage without augmentation from other surface water of the basin.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certificate of entitlement.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Executive Director will issue to each known water user a certificate of entitlement within 30 days after the effective date of these regulations subject to the provisions of paragraph (b). In addition, any other water user may apply for a certificate of entitlement at any time. A preliminary notice of entitlement shall be issued to each user. Such entitlement shall become final and take effect, unless the user shall file with the Commission, within 20 days after the service of the notice of entitlement, a request for hearing by the Commission. At such hearing the water user may show cause why the proposed entitlement shall not take effect.</P>
              <P>(b) The Executive Director shall schedule a hearing to be held not less than ten days after receipt of a request for a hearing by the Commission. Hearings shall be conducted and the results thereof subject to review in accordance with Article 5 of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure.</P>
              <P>(c) A final certificate of entitlement will be issued either upon expiration of the time to request a hearing, where there has been no request, or in accordance with the determination of a hearing where one is held.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> (1) A certificate of entitlement is granted to a specific user for water withdrawals or diversions at a specific facility in the amount of the Legal Entitlement as defined in § 420.23(b).</P>
              <P>(2) A certificate of entitlement shall not be applied, transferred or modified to apply to a facility other than the facility initially specified in the certificate.</P>
              <P>(3) A certificate of entitlement may not be transferred from the certificate holder to another user, except as provided in the exceptions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) A certificate of entitlement does not exempt the certificate holder from paying water supply charges for any portion of water withdrawals or diversions used outside the facility specified in the certificate and any additional service area to which the facility supplied water as of October 27, 1961 or at the facility specified in the certificate by a user other than the certificate holder. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a certificate holder claiming an exemption from charges for water supplied within a service area shall submit proof satisfactory to the Commission identifying the facility's service area as of October 27, 1961. In the absence of proof of the service area as of October <PRTPAGE P="42"/>27, 1961, the service area defined in the Commission docket, if any, for the facility in effect at the time the certificate was issued shall be deemed to be the facility's service area. In the absence of proof of a service area, the certificate shall only exempt the certificate holder from paying water supply charges for water used at the facility.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Termination of certificate.</E> (1) A certificate of entitlement terminates pursuant to this section and without the need for Commission action if at least one of the following occurs:</P>
              <P>(i) The certificate holder dissolves or otherwise ceases to exist;</P>
              <P>(ii) The certificate holder ceases the withdrawals or diversions at the facility to which the certificate of entitlement applies, or abandons the intake, provided that a shutdown of the facility for maintenance or improvement, or a replacement of the intake, that is performed at the earliest practicable commercially reasonable time following commencement of the shutdown or replacement, shall not be deemed to be a cessation of withdrawal or diversion;</P>
              <P>(iii) The certificate holder through contract, lease or other agreement ceases to be the user or public water system supplier of the water withdrawn or diverted at the facility; or</P>
              <P>(iv) There is a change in the ownership or control of the facility. Once terminated, a certificate of entitlement may not be reinstated or reissued.</P>
              <P>(2) A change in ownership or control of the facility includes, but is not limited to, any transaction, acquisition, merger or event (collectively “transaction”) resulting in at least one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) A transfer of title to the facility;</P>
              <P>(ii) A person or entity or the shareholders or other owners of an entity becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, or acquiring alone or in concert the power or right to vote at least 20 percent of any class of ownership interest in a certificate holder or any of its parent entities, regardless of the tier in the corporate or entity structure at which the transaction occurs;</P>
              <P>(iii) A change in ownership or control for purposes of any of the certificate holder's or any of its parent corporations' employee agreements; or</P>
              <P>(iv) A change of the de facto controlling interest in a certificate holder or any of its parent entities, regardless of the tier in the corporate or entity structure at which the change occurs.</P>
              <P>(3) A change of the de facto controlling interest in an entity includes, but is not limited to, a change of the persons or entities with the ability or authority, expressed or reserved, to direct the management or policies of an entity and/or to take at least one of the following actions:</P>
              <P>(i) Amend or change the entity's identity (<E T="03">e.g.</E> joint venture agreement, unincorporated business status);</P>
              <P>(ii) Appoint or remove at least 50% of the members of the Board of Directors or Trustees of a corporation, general partner of a partnership, or a similar member of the governing body of an entity;</P>
              <P>(iii) Amend or change the by-laws, constitution, or other operating or management direction of the entity;</P>
              <P>(iv) Control the sale of, use of or access to any or all of the entity's assets;</P>
              <P>(v) Encumber the entity's assets by way of mortgage or other indebtedness;</P>
              <P>(vi) Control any or all of the assets or other property of the entity upon the sale or dissolution of the entity;</P>

              <P>(viii) Arrange for the sale or transfer of the entity to a new ownership or control;</P>
              <P>(ix) Select or change the management of the entity or determine management compensation; or</P>
              <P>(x) Set operating policies, financial policies or budgets.</P>

              <P>(4) For purposes of applying paragraph (e)(3) of this section, consideration may be given to circumstances particular to the person or entity and certificate holder involved, including without limitation the ability of that person or entity to take actions in light of the number of shares in the certificate holder or its parent entities that are actively voted, the practice of any majority shareholder in exercising or refraining from exercising majority rights, and any agreements giving the person or entity the right to control votes of others.<PRTPAGE P="43"/>
              </P>
              <P>(5) A series of transactions undertaken pursuant to a plan or that are otherwise related shall be considered a single transaction for purposes of this section. For purposes of calculating the twenty percent threshold in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the securities, shares or other interests held immediately prior to the transaction shall be added to the securities, shares or other interests acquired in the transaction.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Exceptions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Agricultural exception.</E> (i) Whenever ownership or possession of land in agricultural use is transferred, any certificate of entitlement with respect to such land shall be deemed to run with the land, if but only if within sixty days following the land transfer the new user demonstrates to the Executive Director that it will continue to use the water withdrawn or diverted for agricultural irrigation. Following any such timely demonstration, the Executive Director shall transfer the certificate of entitlement to the new user. The Executive Director may extend the sixty day period for good cause shown.</P>
              <P>(ii) A certificate of entitlement that has been transferred pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section relieves the user of the obligation to pay water supply charges only with respect to the quantity of water in fact used by the new certificate holder for agricultural irrigation up to the Legal Entitlement specified in the certificate, and not with respect to the quantity of water used for any other purposes. The provisions of § 420.43 shall apply to water uses outside the scope of the certificate of entitlement.</P>
              <P>(iii) A certificate of entitlement that has been transferred pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section terminates pursuant to this paragraph (f)(1) and without the need for Commission action if and when the certificate holder ceases using the water for agricultural irrigation, provided that if the cessation occurs in conjunction with a transfer of ownership or possession of the land in agricultural use, the certificate of entitlement may be transferred to a new user pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(i). Once terminated, a certificate of entitlement may not be reinstated or reissued.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Corporate reorganization exceptions.</E> The following provisions apply where a corporate parent directly or indirectly owning 100% of each class of shares of all of its subsidiary corporations decides to reorganize those subsidiary corporations without affecting the corporate parent's 100% ownership interest.</P>
              <P>(i) Whenever a corporate reorganization consists solely of a change of the name, identity, internal corporate structure, or place of organization of a corporate certificate holder or any of its parent corporations, the Executive Director may reissue a certificate of entitlement in the name of the new owner of the facility, provided that the reorganization does not affect ownership and/or control by the certificate holder's corporate family of companies within the meaning of paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) of this section and does not alter the ultimate corporate parent's 100% ownership interest.</P>
              <P>(ii) A merger or other plan, transaction or series of transactions that effectuates a change of ownership or control within the meaning of paragraphs (e)(2) through (5) does not fall within the exemption of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section on the basis that a corporate reorganization constitutes part of the merger, plan, transaction or series of transactions.</P>

            <P>The water resources within the Southeastern Pennsylvania Ground Water Protected Area shall be managed consistent with the Comprehensive Plan policies. For purposes of this ground water protected area, section 2.20.4 of the Water Code of the Delaware River Basin shall be applied using the following definition of the term “withdrawal limits”:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Withdrawal limits.</E> Except as may be otherwise determined by the Commission to be in the public interest, withdrawals from the underground waters of the basin shall be limited to the maximum draft of all withdrawals from a ground water basin, aquifer, or aquifer system that can be sustained without rendering supplies unreliable, causing long-term progressive lowering of ground water levels, water quality degradation, permanent loss of storage capacity, or substantial impact on low flows of perennial streams.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Advance notice of exploratory drilling.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The Commission encourages consultation with any project sponsor who is considering development of a new or expanded ground water withdrawal that is being planned for any purpose when the daily average withdrawal during any calendar month exceeds 10,000 gallons to insure proper implementation of this regulation and to reduce the possibility of investment in new ground water development facilities which may not be approved hereunder. Such consultation should occur early in the planning stage of a new project and prior to initiation of exploratory drilling.</P>

            <P>(a) Any person, firm corporation or other entity planning a new or expanded ground water withdrawal that may be operated at a daily average withdrawal during any calendar month in excess of 10,000 gallons shall notify the Executive Director not less than 30 days prior to initiation of exploratory <PRTPAGE P="48"/>drilling. Such notice shall be in writing and shall specify the location of proposed new facility, the anticipated rate of withdrawal, and the general purpose of the proposed water use. The notice shall also state the location of existing wells within the radius set forth in § 430.21(a).</P>
            <P>(b) Whenever the Executive Director shall deem necessary, or upon request of a party proposing a new or expanded withdrawal of ground water, an informal conference may be scheduled to review the nature of the proposed withdrawal, the applicability of the Commission's standards relating to ground water, and the requirements of a protected area permit under this regulation.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 430.13</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Protected area permits for new withdrawals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Any person, firm, corporation or other entity who proposes to develop a new ground water withdrawal or expand an existing ground water withdrawal for any purpose within the Southeastern Pennsylvania Ground Water Protected Area shall be required to obtain a protected area permit under this regulation if the proposed new or increased rate of withdrawal from a well or group of wells operated as a system average more than 10,000 gallons per day over a 30-day period. Whenever the Executive Director, upon investigation or upon a reference from a state or federal agency, determines that a new or increased withdrawal from a group of wells within the protected area, whether or not such wells are operated as a system, may have a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin or is likely to have a significant adverse effect on other water uses within the protected area, the Commission may direct a notice to the owners or sponsors of such wells, and require such owners or sponsors to apply for and obtain a protected area permit under this regulation.</P>
            <P>(a) Applications for a protected area permit shall be submitted to the Commission on forms approved by the Executive Director. Each application shall be accompanied by the following information:</P>
            <P>(1) A map indicating the location of existing wells and perennial streams.</P>
            <P>(2) A written report prepared by a hydrogeologist describing the expected effects of the proposed withdrawal on existing wells, flows of perennial streams and the long-term lowering of ground water levels.</P>
            <P>(3) A log showing the nature of subsurface material encountered during the construction and installation of the exploratory or production well(s).</P>
            <P>(4) The detailed results of extended pump tests, of not less than 48 hours duration, and records of observations during such pump tests from representative monitoring wells.</P>
            <P>(b) Applications for a protected area permits whose daily average withdrawal during any calendar month is in excess of 10,000 gallons shall be accompanied by an application fee of $100. Government agencies shall be exempt from such application fee.</P>
            <P>(c) If the application for a protected area permit is for a daily average withdrawal during any calendar month in excess of 100,000 gallons, it shall be accompanied by such other information or exhibits required by Article 3 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. In such cases, only the application fee required by the Rules will be assessed.</P>
            <P>(d) To qualify for approval of a protected area permit, the owner or sponsor of the proposed withdrawal shall demonstrate that:</P>
            <P>(1) The proposed withdrawal is consistent with the Commission's Comprehensive Plan and the policies and purposes of these regulations.</P>
            <P>(2) Opportunities to satisy water requirements on a timely basis from existing available supplies and facilities have been explored and found infeasible.</P>
            <P>(3) The proposed withdrawal, in conjunction with other withdrawals in the applicable ground water basin, will not exceed withdrawal limits of a ground water basin, aquifer or aquifer system.</P>
            <P>(4) The proposed withdrawal will not significantly impair or reduce the flow of perennial streams in the area.</P>

            <P>(5) Existing ground and surface water withdrawals will not be adversely impacted, or will be otherwise assured of adequate supplies in accordance with the requirements of § 430.19 of this part.<PRTPAGE P="49"/>
            </P>
            <P>(6) The proposed withdrawal will not cause substantial, permanent adverse impact to the overlying environment.</P>
            <P>(7) The owner or sponsor has adopted and will implement conservation and management programs as required by § 430.15 of this part.</P>
            <P>(e) Ground water withdrawals for space heating or cooling purposes that are less than 100,000 gallons per day shall be exempt from obtaining a protected area permit provided that the water withdrawn is returned locally, and to the same ground water basin and aquifer system from which it is withdrawn, undiminished in quantity and quality (except temperature). Ground water withdrawals for space heating or cooling that are subsequently used for commercial or industrial water supply purposes are subject to Commission withdrawal and wastewater discharge regulations. Ground water withdrawals exempted pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the registration requirements of § 430.17.</P>
            <P>(f) All ground water withdrawal projects exempted by subsection “e” above shall be constructed in conformance with accepted industry practice and as a minimum shall comply with the following standards:</P>
            <P>(1) All wells shall be drilled by a Pennsylvania licensed well driller and a Water Well Inventory Report shall be completed and filed with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER);</P>
            <P>(2) No wells shall be located within a 100-year floodway;</P>
            <P>(3) All wells shall have top of casing extended a minimum of one foot above the 100-year flood elevation;</P>
            <P>(4) All wells shall have the casing protruding a minimum of six inches above the immediate surrounding grade;</P>
            <P>(5) The area around all wells or well pits shall be constructed and/or graded to prevent the entrance of surface waters;</P>
            <P>(6) All wells shall be accessible for inspection and shall have an access hole for water level measurements;</P>
            <P>(7) In order to protect against significant leaks of refrigerant, all ground water heat pump systems shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown device that senses abnormally low or abnormally high refrigerant pressures;</P>
            <P>(8) Any drilled well holes that are abandoned shall be sealed with a minimum of ten feet of cement grout. Additional seals may be required to separate different water-bearing zones.</P>
            <P>(g) Protected area permits shall be approved or disapproved by the Executive Director with the concurrence of the Pennsylvania member of the Commission or his alternate.</P>
            <P>(h) Dockets and protected area permits may be issued for a duration of up to ten years and shall specify the maximum total withdrawals that must not be exceeded during any consecutive 30-day period. Such maximum total withdrawals shall be based on demands projected to occur during the duration of the docket or protected area permit.</P>
            <P>(i) Ground water withdrawal limits shall be defined for subbasins in accordance with the provisions of (i)(1) or (2) of this section. The limits for specific subbasins are set forth in (i)(3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(1) Baseflow frequency analyses shall be conducted for all subbasins in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Ground Water Protected Area. The analyses shall determine the 1-year-in-25 average annual baseflow rate. The 1-year-in-25 average annual baseflow rate shall serve as the maximum withdrawal limit for net annual ground water withdrawals for subbasins. If net annual ground water withdrawals exceed 75 percent of this rate for a subbasin, such a subbasin shall be deemed “potentially stressed.” The Commission shall maintain a current list of net annual ground water withdrawals for all subbasins. “Net” annual ground water withdrawals includes total ground water withdrawals less total water returned to the ground water system of the same subbasin.</P>

            <P>(2) Upon application by the appropriate governmental body or bodies, the withdrawal limits criteria set forth in (i)(1) of this section may be revised by the Commission to provide additional protection for any subbasin identified in (i)(3) of this section with streams or stream segments designated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as either “high quality,” or “exceptional value,” or “wild,” or “scenic,” <PRTPAGE P="50"/>or “pastoral,” or to correspond with more stringent requirements in integrated resource plans adopted and implemented by all municipalities within a subbasin identified in (i)(3) of this section. Integrated resource plans shall be developed according to sound principles of hydrology. Such plans shall at a minimum assess water resources and existing uses of water; estimate future water demands and resource requirements; evaluate supply-side and demand-side alternatives to meet water withdrawal needs; assess options for wastewater discharge to subsurface formations and streams; consider stormwater and floodplain management; assess the capacity of the subbasin to meet present and future demands for withdrawal and nonwithdrawal uses such as instream flows; identify potential conflicts and problems; incorporate public participation; and outline plans and programs including land use ordinances to resolve conflicts and meet needs. Integrated resource plans shall be adopted and implemented by all municipalities within a subbasin and incorporated into each municipality's Comprehensive Plan.</P>
            <P>(3)(i) The potentially stressed levels and withdrawal limits for all delineated basins and subbasins are set forth below:</P>

            <P>(ii) Subject to public notice and hearing, this section may be updated or revised based upon new and evolving information on hydrology and streamflow and ground water monitoring or in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section.</P>
            <P>(j) Upon its determination that a subbasin is potentially stressed, the Commission shall notify all ground water users in the subbasin withdrawing 10,000 gallons per day or more during any 30-day period of its determination. If any such users have not obtained a docket or protected area permit from the Commission, they shall be required to apply to the Commission within 60 days of notification.</P>

            <P>(k) In potentially stressed subbasins, dockets and protected area permit applications for new or expanded ground water withdrawals must include one or more programs to mitigate the adverse impacts of the new or expanded ground <PRTPAGE P="52"/>water withdrawal. The eligible programs are noted below. If the remainder of the application and the program(s) submitted are acceptable, the withdrawal may be approved by the Commission for an initial three-year period. The applicant shall implement the program(s) immediately upon Commission approval. If after the three-year period the program(s) is deemed successful by the Commission, the docket or permit duration may be extended for up to 10 years. The project sponsor shall be required to continue the program(s) for the duration of the docket or permit.</P>
            <P>(1) A conjunctive use program that demonstrates the applicant's capability to obtain at least 15 percent of its average annual system usage from a reliable surface water supply. An acceptable program shall include either reservoir storage or an interconnection with a surface water supplier and an agreement or contract to purchase water from the supplier for the duration of the docket or permit.</P>
            <P>(2) A water conservation program that exceeds the requirements of § 430.15. For existing water utilities, the program shall reduce average annual per capita water usage by at least five percent. All conservation programs shall include water conservation pricing, either inclining block rates, seasonal rates, or excess-use surcharges, and plumbing fixture rebate or retrofit components. For self-supplied users, the program shall include water efficient technologies such as recycling, reuse, xeriscaping, drip or micro irrigation, or other innovative technology approved by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) A program to monitor and control ground water infiltration to the receiving sewer system. The program must quantify ground water infiltration to the system and document reductions in infiltration. The program should include such measures as leakage surveys of sewer mains, metering of sewer flows in mains and interceptors, analysis of sewer system flows to quantify infiltration, and remedial measures such as repair of leaks and joints, main lining, and main replacement.</P>
            <P>(4) An artificial recharge or spray irrigation program that demonstrates a return of at least 60 percent of the total new or expanded annual withdrawal to the same ground water basin and aquifer system from which it is withdrawn. The program shall not impair ground water quality.</P>
            <P>(5) An alternative program approved by the Commission to mitigate the adverse impacts of the new or expanded ground water withdrawal.</P>
            <P>(l) The durations of all existing dockets and protected area permits may be extended by the Commission for an additional five years if the docket or permit holder successfully implements in either (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this section. If the docket or permit holder successfully implements both options, the docket or permit may be extended for an additional ten years. The Executive Director shall notify all docket and permit holders potentially affected by this resolution of their right to file an application to determine their eligibility for extension.</P>

            <P>(m) It is the policy of the Commission to prevent, to the extent reasonably possible, net annual ground water withdrawals from exceeding the maximum withdrawal limit. An application for a proposed new or expanded ground water withdrawal that would result in net annual ground water withdrawals exceeding the maximum withdrawal limit established in paragraph (i)(3) of this section shall set forth the applicant's proposal for complying with the Commission's policy, with such supporting documentation as may be required by the Executive Director. Notification of the application shall be given to all affected existing water users who may also submit comments or recommendations for consideration by the Commission on the pending application. In taking action upon the application, the Commission shall give consideration to the submissions from the applicant and affected water users. If the Commission determines that it is in the public interest to do so, it may reduce the total of proposed and existing ground water withdrawals within a subbasin to a level at or below the withdrawal limit. Unless otherwise determined by the Commission, docket <PRTPAGE P="53"/>and permit holders shall share equitably in such reductions.</P>

            <P>(c) In all instances where the Public Information Officer determines that a request for information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public (despite a § 701.203 determination of burden), such request shall be met either without cost wherever practicable or at a reduced cost to the requester.

            <P>(a) The interest rate to be used in plan formulation and evaluation for discounting future benefits and computing costs, or otherwise converting benefits and costs to a common time basis, shall be based upon the average yield during the preceding fiscal year on interest-bearing marketable securities of the United States which, at the time the computation is made, have terms of 15 years or more remaining to maturity: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in no event shall the rate be raised or lowered more than one-quarter of 1 percent for any year. The average yield shall be computed as the average during the fiscal year of the daily bid prices. Where the average rate so computed is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent nearest to such average rate.</P>
            <P>(b) The computation shall be made as of July 1 of each year, and the rate thus computed shall be used during the succeeding 12 months. The Executive Director shall annually request the Secretary of the Treasury to inform the Water Resources Council of the rate thus computed.</P>
            <P>(c) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply to all Federal and federally assisted water and related land resources project evaluation reports submitted to the Congress, or approved administratively, after the close of the second session of the 90th Congress.</P>
            <P>(d) Where construction of a project has been authorized prior to the close of the second session of the 90th Congress, and the appropriate State or local governmental agency or agencies have given prior to December 31, 1969, satisfactory assurances to pay the required non-Federal share of project costs, the discount rate to be used in the computation of benefits and costs for such project shall be the rate in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this section, and that rate shall continue to be used for such project until construction has been completed, unless the Congress otherwise decides.</P>
            <P>(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the discount rate to be used in plan formulation and evaluation during the remainder of the fiscal year 1969 shall be 4<FR>5/8</FR> percent except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
            <P>(f) Section V. G. 2 of the interagency agreement dated May 15, 1962, approved by the President on May 15, 1962, entitled “Policies, Standards, and Procedures in the Formulation, Evaluation, and Review of Plans for Use and Development of Water and Related Land Resources,” and published on May 29, 1962, as Senate Document No. 97, 87th Congress, 2d Session, is superseded by the provisions of this section.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Discrimination prohibited.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under, any program to which this part applies.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.</E> (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may not directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin:</P>
          <P>(i) Deny a person any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;</P>
          <P>(ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to a person which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;</P>
          <P>(iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
          <P>(iv) Restrict a person in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;</P>
          <P>(v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program; or</P>
          <P>(vi) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program.</P>
          <P>(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.</P>
          <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilties will be provided under any such program, or the class of persons to be afforded an opprotunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(3) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.</P>
          <P>(4) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
          <P>(5) This part does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. When previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Employment practices.</E> (1) Where a primary objective of a program of Federal financial assistance to which this part applies is to provide employment, a recipient or other party subject to this part shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices <PRTPAGE P="77"/>under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, hiring, firing, upgrading, promotion, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation or benefits, selection for training or apprenticeship, use of facilities, and treatment of employees).

The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 or any Executive Order which supersedes it.</P>
          <P>(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to the employment practice of the recipient or other persons subject to the regulation, to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Location of facilities.</E> A recipient may not make a selection of a site or location of a facility if the purpose of that selection, or its effect when made, is to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this rule applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or if the purpose is to, or its effect when made will, substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of this part.</P>

In all other cases, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible agency official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances for each program, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors, and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program.

In the case of any program under which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient or subcontracts with any other person or group, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible agency official during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities, as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Whenever any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution, or person and that agency, institution, or person fails or refuses to furnish that information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and set forth the efforts which it has made to obtain the information.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program under which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Periodic compliance reviews.</E> The responsible agency official shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Complaints.</E> Any person who believes himself or any specific class of individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by himself or by a representative file with the responsible agency official a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible agency official.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Investigations.</E> The responsible agency official will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, whenever appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Resolution of matters.</E> (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the responsible agency official will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible.

          <P>(e) <E T="03">Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.</E> No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because he has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purpose of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.</P>

          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with assurance requirement.</E> If an applicant or recipient fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 705.5 or fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of the assurance it has furnished, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with any requirement imposed by or pursuant to Title VI or this part, Federal financial assistance may be suspended, terminated, or refused in accordance with the procedures of Title VI and this part. The Water Resources Council shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of administrative proceedings under this part, except that the Council will continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings whenever such assistance is due and payable pursuant to a final commitment made or an application finally approved prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:</P>
          <P>(1) The responsible agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;</P>
          <P>(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part;</P>
          <P>(3) The action has been approved by the Chairman of the Water Resources Council pursuant to § 705.10(e); and</P>
          <P>(4) The expiration of 30 days after the responsible agency official has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance with Title VI of the Act by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:</P>
          <P>(1) The responsible agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;</P>
          <P>(2) The recipient or other person has been notified or its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and</P>
          <P>(3) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 705.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less <PRTPAGE P="80"/>than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible agency official that the matter be scheduled for heaing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 705.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Water Resources Council in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by the responsible agency official unless it determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Council requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible agency official or at its discretion, before a hearing examiner appointed in accordance with section 3105 of Title 5, U.S.C., or detailed under section 3344 of Title 5, U.S.C.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Decisions and notices.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) Procedure on decisions by hearing examiner. If the hearing is held by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible agency official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing examiner, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the responsible agency official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible agency official may, on his own motion, within 45 days after the initial <PRTPAGE P="81"/>decison, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of notice of review, the responsible agency official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice or review the initial decision shall, subject to paragraph (e) constitute the final decision of the responsible agency official.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the responsible agency official.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the responsible agency official for decision or its reviews the decision of a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or whenever the responsible agency official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with it briefs or other written statements of its contentions and a written copy of the final decision of the responsible agency official shall be sent to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 705.9, a decision shall be made by the responsible agency official on the record and a written copy of such decision shall be sent to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision of a hearing examiner or the responsible agency official shall set forth his or its ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval by the Chairman.</E> Any final decision by the responsible agency official provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Chairman of the Water Resources Council, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, under the program involved, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance will thereafter be extended under such programs to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible agency official that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Post termination proceedings.</E> (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.</P>

          <P>(3) If the responsible agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the responsible agency official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record. The applicant or recipient will be estored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1). While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the <PRTPAGE P="82"/>order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

Any action, taken, determination made, or requirements imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the responsible agency official.</P>

            <P>The maintenance of unusually high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality, and conduct by employees and <PRTPAGE P="83"/>special Government employees is essential to assure the proper performance of the Water Resources Council's (hereafter referred to as the Council) business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the part of employees and special Government employees through informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these standards. To accord with these concepts, this part sets forth the Council's regulations prescribing standards of conduct and responsibilities and governing statements of employment and financial interests for employees and special Government employees.</P>

            <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who:</P>
            <P>(1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the Council;</P>

            <P>(3) The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans; and<PRTPAGE P="84"/>

However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under Council orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.</P>

            <P>(a) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) establishes national policies and goals for the protection and enhancement of the environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain policy statements and procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. In particular, all Federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</P>
            <P>(b) Executive Order 11991 of May 24, 1977, amended E.O. 11514 and directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to issue regulations to implement the procedural provisions of NEPA. Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) on November 29, 1978, which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979. Section 1507.3(a) of CEQ regulations provides that each Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing procedures to supplement the regulations. Section 1507.3(b) of the CEQ NEPA regulations identifies those sections of the regulations which must be addressed in agency procedures.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this NEPA rule is to establish Water Resources Council (WRC) policy and procedures which supplement the CEQ NEPA regulations by making them more specifically applicable to our activities and which implement § 1507.3 (a) and (b) of the CEQ NEPA regulations. This rule will be revised to incorporate detailed procedures integrating NEPA and the Principles and Standards (P&amp;S) and applicable parts of the procedures for Federal participants in the preparation of comprehensive regional or river basin plans when these procedures are developed. This NEPA rule must be used in conjunction with the CEQ NEPA regulations. Compliance with both the CEQ NEPA regulations and this NEPA rule is required. Information in the CEQ NEPA regulations generally is not repeated here to avoid needless duplication. This NEPA rule supersedes WRC Policy Statement No. 2—Environmental Statements-Framework Studies and Assessments and Regional or River Basin Plans.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Applicability.</SUBJECT>
            <P>This NEPA rule applies to the WRC as an independent executive agency and to Title II river basin commissions (RBC's) and other entities (such as interagency committees) preparing studies and plans for WRC review and transmittal to the President. Although Title III State planning grants do not normally require environmental assessments or statements (§ 707.8 (a)(3)), the WRC will encourage States receiving grants to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions and to incorporate suitable environmental conditions, to the extent permitted by State law. The preamble to the WRC Title III guidelines will reflect this policy.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Responsible Federal Official (RFO).</E> The “Responsible Federal Official (RFO)” is the official of the Federal Government designated by this rule <PRTPAGE P="91"/>who shall be responsible for the implementation of NEPA, including regulations issued by the CEQ (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) and the rule. Of particular importance, the RFO determines the need for an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with § 707.8 (a)(2) and (b), and if an EIS is required, files the draft and final EIS, makes the Record of Decision and assures appropriate public involvement in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.6. The Chairman of the RBC's are the RFO's for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of NEPA and the P&amp;S for those activities which are funded in whole or in part through the WRC and carried out by the RBC's, such as framework studies, special studies, comprehensive coordinated joint plans, regional or river basin (Level B) plans and revisions thereof. The Chairman of the WRC, or his designee, is the RFO for complying with the provisons of NEPA and the P&amp;S for those framework studies, regional or river basin plans, comprehensive coordinated joint plans, and special studies which are funded by the WRC and carried out by WRC interagency committees and WRC coordinating committees; principles, standards and procedures for planning water and related land resources; rules and regulations of the WRC, and other activities of the WRC.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Major Federal Action.</E> “Major Federal action” as defined in the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.18) includes actions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control and responsibility. Such actions include WRC interagency committee, and WRC coordinating committee adoption, approval or submittal of plans for water and related land resources. For the purpose of this rule, RBC adoption, approval or submittal of a plan for water and related land resources is considered a major Federal action by virtue of the scope and significant environmental consequences of such actions, the participation of Federal officials in these RBC actions, and the WRC requirements for Federal agency consistency with approved regional water resource management plans (WRC Policy Statement No. 4—The Utilization of Comprehensive Regional Water Resource Management Plans).</P>

            <SUBJECT>Policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The WRC and the RBC's administer certain programs that must comply with both NEPA and the P&amp;S. Generally, the environmental analysis done during the development of the Environmental Quality (EQ) account under the P&amp;S partially overlaps the analysis required in an EIS, presenting an opportunity for integration. The requirements of NEPA and the P&amp;S will be carried out by integrating the two processes to the fullest extent practicable and by combining to the fullest extent practicable the Environmental Assessment or, when required, Environmental Impact Statement, with each study or plan into a single document that will comply fully with the requirements of both processes, as provided by the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.10 and 1506.4).</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Public participation.</E> For each environmental assessment and impact statement, the appropriate RFO will establish a specific program and schedule for public participation of all interested parties in the NEPA process, and shall otherwise provide for public involvement in accordance with the CEQ NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Environmental Impact Statements.</E> Environmental Impact Statements (EIS's) as required under Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA will be prepared by river basin commissions, interagency committee, or WRC coordinating committees for comprehensive coordinated joint plans and regional or river basin (Level B) plans, or revisions thereof. The Environmental Impact Statement will be prepared concurrently with the preparation of the study or plan. The statement will reflect the level of planning involved and will address those environmental considerations and alternatives relevant to decisionmaking at that level (see § 707.9 Tiering). Review and comment on the draft study or plan and the incorporated draft environmental impact statement will be performed simultaneously, and the final combined report will incorporate and discuss the comments received on the draft.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Early involvement in private, State, local, and other non-Federal activities requiring Federal action.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 1501.2(d) of the CEQ NEPA regulations requires Federal agencies to provide for early involvement in activities which, while planned by private or other non-Federal entities, requires some subsequent form of Federal approval or action to which NEPA applies. Such activities for which early involvement is appropriate include those private, local, State, or regional water and related land resources plans, projects or programs which should be included in a regional water resources management plan or Level B plan, since the plans normally required an EIS or assessment as provided in § 707.8(a) of this NEPA rule.</P>
            <P>(b) To facilitate the implementation of 40 CFR 1501.2(d), the appropriate RFO shall publish and distribute in the region or basin in which a comprehensive or Level B study is conducted, guidelines for non-Federal entities of the types of plans, projects, and programs which shall be included in such comprehensive or Level B plan. The RFO shall advise non-Federal entities on the scope and level of environmental information and analysis needed for environmental documents.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Ensuring that environmental documents are actually considered in agency decisionmaking.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of the environmental documents in agency decisionmaking. To implement these requirements, the RFO shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Consider relevant environmental documents in evaluating actions proposed in plans and studies.</P>
            <P>(2) Make relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses part of the record in any formal rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings.</P>
            <P>(3) Ensure that relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the proposed actions through existing review processes.</P>
            <P>(4) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating proposals for agency action.</P>
            <P>(5) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific alternatives analyzed in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.</P>
            <P>(b) The NEPA process begins at the earliest possible stage of the planning process and is completed when the RFO makes a finding of significant impact or a record of decision. In cases where the Chairman of a River Basin Commission, or regional Federal official has been designated as the RFO, and a plan or report is submitted to WRC for review and comment after completion of the NEPA process, the environmental documents incorporated into such plans or reports, or submitted with them, shall be fully considered by WRC when it prepares its views, comments, and recommendations for transmittal to the President and Congress. The RFO shall include the Findings of No Significant Impact, or the Record of Decision, with the documents submitted to WRC for review.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Typical classes of action requiring similar treatment under NEPA.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Section 1507.3(b)(2) of the CEQ NEPA regulations in conjunction with § 1508.4 requires agencies to establish three typical classes of action for similar treatment under NEPA. These typical classes of actions are set forth below:</P>
            <P>(1) Actions normally requiring EIS's:</P>
            <P>(i) Adoption, approval or submittal of regional water resources management plans (comprehensive, coordinated, joint plans or elements thereof).</P>
            <P>(ii) Adoption, approval or submittal of Level B plans.</P>
            <P>(2) Actions normally requiring assessments but not necessarily EIS's:</P>
            <P>(i) Establishment and implementing guidance (including significant changes) in principles, standards, and procedures for planning water and related land resources.</P>

            <P>(ii) Adoption, approval or submittal of framework studies and special studies which include recommendations for future actions.<PRTPAGE P="93"/>
            </P>
            <P>(iii) Any action not in paragraph (a) (1) or (3) of this section.</P>
            <P>(3) Actions normally not requiring assessments or EIS's (categorical exclusions):</P>
            <P>(i) Approval of Title III State planning grants.</P>
            <P>(ii) Adoption, approval or transmittal or priorities reports.</P>
            <P>(iii) Preparation of the National Water Assessment.</P>
            <P>(iv) Recommendations to the President with the respect to Federal policies and programs, except for transmittal of plans described in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section for which the original EIS or Environmental Assessment (EA) will be transmitted with the plan. A second EIS is not required.</P>
            <P>(v) Framework studies and assessments and special studies which do not include recommendations for future actions.</P>
            <P>(b) Where the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that an action normally excluded may have a significant environmental effect, the appropriate RFO shall independently determine whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 707.9</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Tiering.</SUBJECT>
            <P>In accordance with the CEQ NEPA regulations 40 CFR 1502.4(d) and 1508.28(a), this NEPA rule emphasizes the use of tiering to relate broad and narrow actions. The level of detail in EIS's and EA's prepared by RBC's, WRC interagency committees or WRC coordinating committees will reflect the level of detail in the plans, particularly the comprehensive and policy nature of comprehensive, coordinated, joint plans or elements or revisions thereof. These EIS's are not intended to substitute for individual statements on individual projects as more detailed planning and analysis will be required for major Federal actions proposed in these plans. The “policy” or “overview” EIS should serve as the framework and introduction for a more site-specific project EIS developed by the implementing Federal agency. Environmental impact statements for regional water resource management and Level B plans will generally address the items in the recommended format (40 CFR 1502.10) on the basis of water and related land resources of an entire region or river basin. This is the level of consideration at which the environmental issues and considerations are most relevant to decisionmaking. They may also address groups of interrelated or individual plan elements where these involve significant environmental considerations.</P>

          <P>(b) This part applies to the following organizations with references to the activities described in § 708.2(a):</P>
          <P>(1) The Commission, including its staff and persons, organizations, and agencies under contract to it for work within the scope of the Master Plan.</P>
          <P>(2) Such Federal departments and agencies as are directed under section 101(3) of the Act to conduct studies pursuant to the Master Plan, for any work carried out for purposes of developing, revising, and implementing the Master Plan.</P>
          <P>(3) Such departments and agencies of any state or local government as are authorized and/or directed to carry out studies and analyses under direction or advice of the Commission as stipulated in section 101 of the Act.</P>
          <P>(c) The guidelines referred to in this part shall be considered general requirements applicable to all studies, procedures, programs, regulations, or other administrative devices carried out under § 708.2(b), but only for those Master Plan Activities under authority of the Act.</P>
        </SECTION>
        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 708.3</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Policy, objectives, and standards.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Policy.</E> (1) Congress has directed the Commission to prepare a comprehensive Master Plan for management of the System in cooperation with appropriate Federal, state, and local officials. In developing the plan, the Commission is required to identify various economic, recreational, and environmental objectives of the System, recommend guidelines to achieve such objectives, and propose methods to assure compliance with such guidelines and coordination of future management decisions affecting the System, and include with the proposed plan any legislative proposals which may be necessary to carry out such recommendations and achieve such objectives.</P>
          <P>(2) The Commission is required to provide for public participation in the development, revision, and implementation of the Master Plan and to encourage and assist such participation. In doing this, the Commission seeks to foster a spirit of openness and a sense of mutual trust between the public and the planners. Public participation is expected to result in greater responsiveness of the Master Plan to public concerns and priorities, as well as improved popular understanding of official studies, planning processes, and decisions.</P>
          <P>(3) In order for public participation to be effective, it must be timely and integrated into the planning process. The Commission shall seek public participation prior to any decision-making on the Master Plan or any of its components. Such public participation will ordinarily include informational output about the plan, public response and input, two-way discussions or exchange, and Commission consideration of public expressions.</P>

          <P>(4) Neither the Master Plan as a whole nor any component of it shall be formulated without incorporation of a program of public participation involving fair representation of all segments of the public. The public participation <PRTPAGE P="95"/>section of the Master Plan—Plan of Study shall be developed consistent with the guidelines described in this part.</P>

          <P>(5) Public participation processes utilized by the Commission in developing the Master Plan shall aim for the highest achievable standards of objectivity and thoroughness consistent with other requirements of the Act and the intent, concepts, ideas, and basic tenets of the Principles and Standards for Planning Water and Related Land Resources published by the Water Resources Council in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> Volume 38, Number 174, part III, September 10, 1973 and any forthcoming revisions. Public participation programs shall include monitoring procedures to maintain an acceptable degree of responsiveness and accountability.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Objectives.</E> Objectives of the public participation program developed by the Commission as part of the Master Plan are:</P>
          <P>(1) To develop awareness of public preferences by those responsible for preparation and approval of the Master Plan.</P>
          <P>(2) To anticipate and help resolve conflicts arising during the study,</P>
          <P>(3) To improve information transfer and public awareness of the study,</P>
          <P>(4) To provide for periodic reviews in the development of the Master Plan as well as the final review required by the Act, and</P>
          <P>(5) To provide for evaluation of public participation in the planning process.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Standards.</E> The Commission in meeting the above objectives recognizes that:</P>
          <P>(1) Inputs from the public are important for development of the Master Plan;</P>
          <P>(2) Participants are to include individual citizens as well as organizations;</P>
          <P>(3) The public participation program is to assume the existence of numerous publics and their interests—identified and delineated according to a number of socioeconomic, demographic, geographic, person, and ideological variables;</P>
          <P>(4) The public participation process must be continuous: it is to be provided for, encouraged, and assisted throughout the planning process;</P>
          <P>(5) The public participation process is to have as a product measurable sets of opinion and other manifestations of the public will in regard to details of the Master Plan;</P>
          <P>(6) Inputs from the public into the Master Plan through avenues other than the Commission public participation program should be facilitated; and</P>
          <P>(7) Desires expressed by the public are likely to be conflicting and therefore, public participation cannot be substituted for the decision-making responsibility.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Required programs and reports.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Commission shall prepare a work plan for public participation as part of the Master Plan—Plan of Study. The work plan shall satisfy minimum standards described in this part. The work plan shall describe all substantive administrative and management arrangements to elicit public participation, shall delineate Commission member and staff responsibilities, and shall identify budgetary provisions.</P>
          <P>(b) In addition to public meetings and hearings, the public participation program shall include survey research, program evaluation, and information/education activities as described in § 708.5.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission shall recommend long-term public participation activities and programs related to implementation of the Master Plan. These recommendations shall be based on evaluation of procedures and results mandated in this part and carried out during the Master Plan preparation.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission shall issue reports describing the participation program as developed or implemented during the designated reporting period. Each such report shall include as a minimum a brief description of the main participation elicited, the costs of the effort, and the use that was made of the elicited information in the planning process. The reporting periods shall be arranged so as to correspond generally with the main sequential segments of the overall planning process.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Program objectives implementation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The continuing public participation program shall contain mechanisms or activities for each objective listed in § 708.3(b). The listing of specific measures in this section shall not preclude additional techniques for obtaining, encouraging, or assisting public participation. Special efforts shall be made to simplify the planning process and products for public and media use. Variances may occur in the use of any given program element, according to the nature of the planning issues, the budgetary resources accorded the participation process, and the effectiveness of the participation actually elicited and measured in the field.</P>
          <P>(b) To obtain data in regard to plan-relevant public opinion, methods, shall include but not be limited to survey research.</P>
          <P>(1) The survey research process shall be developed and utilized in connection with the Master Plan as a whole and its components. Whereas public meetings are organized to elicit unstructured participation and opinion changes, surveys shall be targeted on carefully selected samples of functionally defined publics located throughout the System.</P>
          <P>(2) The Commission shall evaluate the effectiveness of the information/education program on the part of the surveyed publics. This is necessary for continued and sustained participation in the decision-making steps of the planning process.</P>
          <P>(3) If a gap is found between the desired and actual effectiveness, the Commission shall develop and implement a short-term narrow-focus information and education program targeted at the specific problem areas in question.</P>
          <P>(4) On completion of the short-term information/education program, re-surveys shall be made among the affected publics. The results shall constitute a measure of the effectiveness of the short-term information/education program.</P>
          <P>(c) To improve information transfer and public awareness of the study, two levels of information and education activities shall be pursued. The first shall have the general public as its target audience and shall emphasize methods that foster general awareness and understanding of plan issues and the nature of the ongoing planning process. The second level of information and education activities shall focus on public interest groups, agency representatives, and elected officials and shall emphasize the creation of plan component data and information in a form that can be utilized by these groups in the plan decision-making process. The information presented shall be broadly representative of the relevant perspectives and issues.</P>
          <P>(d) Throughout the period of study and the succeeding period of implementation of the Master Plan, the Commission shall provide a centralized capability for acting as an information/education center. The Commission shall provide a central source of media-directed information about the Master Plan, its components, future expected planning needs in the System, current program-related activities, and other relevant subject areas. Special efforts shall be made to summarize complex technical materials for public and media use.

          <SUBJECT>Introduction.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Governors of the States of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and a representative of the President of the United States are members of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. The Commission is a regional governmental agency whose purpose is to effect comprehensive multiple purpose planning for the conservation, utilization, development, management, and control of the water and related natural resources of the basin, which includes part of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.</P>
          <P>(b) The Susquehanna River Basin Compact provides broad authority for the Commission to carry out basinwide planning programs and projects, and to take independent action as it determines essential to fulfill its statutory regional governmental role.</P>
          <P>(c) The objectives of the Commission are to:</P>
          <P>(1) Develop cooperative and coordinated Federal, State, local, and private water and related natural resources planning within the basin,</P>
          <P>(2) Formulate, adopt, effectuate, and keep current a comprehensive plan and a water resources program for the immediate and long-range use and development of the water resources of the basin,</P>
          <P>(3) Provide for orderly collection and evaluation of data, and for the continuing promotion and conduct of appropriate research relating to water resources problems,</P>
          <P>(4) Establish priorities for planning, financing subject to applicable laws, development and use of projects and facilities essential to effectively meet identified water resource needs,</P>
          <P>(5) And to maintain these resources in a viable state.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission shall employ a multiobjective approach recognizing national economy, regional development and environmental quality in planning for the use and development of the water resources of the basin.</P>
          <P>(e) It is the purpose of this document to set forth the objectives of the Commission and to present certain basic policies that (1) have basinwide application, (2) are specifically pertinent to the formulation of a comprehensive plan, (3) will serve as guidelines for all agencies or individuals with planning responsibilities for the development and use of the water resources of the basin, (4) form the basis for working relationship between the Commission and other agencies having related responsibilities in the basin. This statement will be amended and updated from time to time.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Standard definitions.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Many terms that will be used in official Commission documents may have slightly different meanings to various groups. To avoid confusion and to increase the clarity of the meaning the Commission applies to frequently used terms standard definitions will be utilized.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission will use the standard definitions set forth for the terms shown in section 1.2 of the Compact, <SU>1</SU>
            <FTREF/> and will add terms and appropriate definitions as deemed necessary.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Coordination, cooperation, and intergovernmental relations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The interstate nature of the Susquehanna River Basin and the broad regional authority of the Commission require clear and effective working relationships with the States, Federal Government, and local and private sectors in all matters relating to the water resources of the basin.</P>
          <P>(1) The Federal Government will be encouraged and asked to participate in water resources projects and programs having national or broad regional significance. The Commission will act to encourage local initiative to solve water resources problems within a local and regional context, but when faced with obviously needed action that is not forthcoming from other sources will act, in accordance with the Compact, on its own.</P>
          <P>(2) The Compact provides authority for the Commission to serve in a regulatory capacity and also to act as a managing and operating agency. The Commission will exercise its regulatory authority mainly in interstate matters or where signatory authority is not being effectively exercised or where the signatory has little or no authority to act. Similarly, the Commission may manage and operate various facilities if it is determined that this is an area in which an important and necessary service can be rendered.</P>
          <P>(3) Should it become necessary for the Commission to undertake development, management and operation of projects, arrangements for repayment of all project costs and eventual operation and maintenance costs will be appropriately prorated among the signatories or otherwise financed in accordance with the Compact.</P>
          <P>(4) The Commission will utilize the functions, powers, and duties of the existing offices and agencies of government to the extent consistent with the Compact.</P>
          <P>(5) In its actions the Commission will maintain a high level of public visibility. Broad government, public, and private sector commentary on Commission proposals and findings will be invited, and to the extent possible be incorporated and reflected in decisions for finalization of plans, projects, and programs having significant effect on the water resources of the basin. A concerted effort will be made to keep the Commission and its activities readily available to government and public scrutiny, and responsive to their concerns.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission shall exercise its regional jurisdiction in an effort to avoid and minimize conflicts and duplication of effort and shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Cooperate with and help coordinate Federal, State, local government, and private sector efforts in all matters relating to the planning, conservation, preservation, use, development, management and control of the water resources of the basin.</P>
          <P>(2) Develop administrative agreements, as needed, with appropriate agencies of the signatories and other agencies to facilitate achievement of the Commission's objectives and related responsibilities of other agencies by minimizing duplication of effort and maximizing the contributions the respective agencies are best able to make.</P>
          <P>(3) Build upon present water resources planning and related activities of the signatory parties, local government, other public bodies, and the private sector and fully consider their recommendations and suggestions.</P>
          <P>(4) Establish advisory committees as needed for specific assignments and seek meaningful liaison with sources of technical and scientific expertise.</P>
          <P>(5) Share with interested parties results of investigations, studies, tests, and research undertaken by the Commission in an appropriate manner and form.</P>
          <P>(6) Conduct its regular meetings announced in advance and open to the public.</P>
          <P>(7) Depend upon existing public and private agencies for the construction, operation, and maintenance of projects except when the project is necessary to further the comprehensive plan and the responsible agency does not act or when the Commission is asked to act by one or more signatories, one or more local governments, or other responsible entities.</P>

          <P>(8) Require that the planning of projects affecting the water resources of the basin by Federal, State, local agencies and private organizations be <PRTPAGE P="113"/>undertaken in coordination with the Commission and in accordance with the Compact.</P>
          <P>(9) Require that periodic reports of projects affecting water resources within the basin and listings of discharge permits granted, and similar activities undertaken by offices or agencies of the signatory parties, be submitted to the Commission.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Allocations, diversions, withdrawals and release.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The extremes in availability of water in the basin means that water will not always be available when and where it is needed. One of the responsibilities of the Commission is to act upon requests for allocations, withdrawals, or diversions of water for in-basin or out-of-basin use. Water emergencies may be expected to develop in portions of the basin due to drought conditions or other causes. The Commission will act promptly to effect alleviation of the condition to the extent posible.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission will require evidence that proposed interbasin transfers of water will not jeopardize, impair or limit the efficient development and management of the Susquehanna River Basin's water resources, or any aspects of these resources for in-basin use, or have a significant unfavorable impact on the resources of the basin and the receiving waters of the Chesapeake Bay.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission may, in making decisions on allocations, diversions, withdrawals, and releases, consider the following principles among others:</P>
          <P>(1) That allocations, diversions, or withdrawals of water be based on the common law principles of riparian rights which entitles landholders in any watershed to draw upon the natural stream flow in reasonable amounts and be entitled to the stream flow not unreasonably diminished in quality or quantity by upstream use or diversion of water; and on the maintenance of the historic seasional variations of the flows into Chesapeake Bay.</P>
          <P>(d) When the need arises for action on requests for allocations, diversions, or withdrawals of water from either surface or ground waters of the basin the Commission shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Allocate waters of the basin to and among the signatory States to the Compact as the need appears, and impose related conditions, obligations, and release requirements.</P>
          <P>(2) Determine if a proposed allocation, withdrawal or diversion is in conflict with or will significantly affect the comprehensive plan, and assure existing immediate and projected long term local and regional uses are protected.</P>
          <P>(3) Impose conditions, obligations and release requirements for dams and/or diversion structures to protect prior local interests, downstream interests, and environmental quality.</P>
          <P>(4) In the matter of drought, disasters or catastrophes, natural or manmade, which cause actual and immediate shortage of available and usable water supply, determine and delineate the area of shortage and by unanimous vote declare a state of water supply emergency therein, and impose direct controls on any and all allocations, diversions and uses of water to meet the emergency condition.</P>
          <P>(5) In water emergencies coordinate the efforts of Federal, State, local, and other persons and entities in dealing with the emergency.</P>
          <P>(6) Determine and delineate, after public hearing, areas within the basin wherein the demands upon supply made by water users have developed or threaten to develop to such a degree as to create a water shortage or impair or conflict with the comprehensive plan.</P>
          <P>(7) When areas in need of protection from overdemand of safe yield of the supply have been delineated, declare such areas protected from further depletion, with the consent of the member or members from the affected State or States.</P>
          <P>(8) Require that no person divert or withdraw from any protected area water for domestic, municipal, agricultural, or industrial uses in excess of such quantities as the Commission may prescribe by general regulation or pursuant to a permit granted heretofore under the laws of any of the signatory States.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Project review.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Compact provides generally that no project affecting the water resources of the basin shall be undertaken by any person, governmental authority, or other entity prior to approval by the Commission.</P>
          <P>(b) In many instances, one or more of the signatory parties will exercise project review authority regarding proposed projects in the basin coming under the review of the Commission. Accordingly the Commission will direct its attention to reviewing the completeness and effectiveness of the review procedures of the signatories and will endeavor to minimize duplication of staff effort, and time and cost to the applicant.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission will establish exempt categories in accordance with the section 3.10-3 of the Compact, and for projects determined not to have a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin. In dealing with Federal or federally licensed projects, the Commission will take the provisions of reservations (r) and (w) of United States Pub. L. 91-575 (84 Stat. 1509) and provisions of the Compact into account.</P>
          <P>(d) It is expected that project review procedures will be modified following adoption of the comprehensive plan. In the meantime the Commission will:</P>
          <P>(1) Base its review and comments pertaining to proposed projects within the basin coming under the purview of the Commission, on review and comments of signatory parties. In general, the Commission review will seek to ascertain the completeness of procedures followed by the signatory parties in their review, and will refrain from specifically rechecking detailed evaluations. (Susquehanna River Basin Commission Resolution No. 72-5)</P>
          <P>(2) Require as it determines necessary, submission of pertinent project plans and documents for its independent review and approval. The purpose of this review will be to ascertain whether all relevant provisions of the Compact and actions taken pursuant thereto have been observed:</P>
          <P>(i) When the Commission has determined that a project may have significant effect on the water resources of the basin.</P>
          <P>(ii) When a proposed project does not fall under the review jurisdiction of any agency of the signatory parties.</P>

        <SECTION>
          <SECTNO>§ 801.5</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Comprehensive plan.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Compact requires that the Commission formulate and adopt a comprehensive plan for the immediate and long-range development and use of the water resources of the basin.</P>
          <P>(1) The plan will include existing and proposed public and private programs, projects, and facilities which are required, in the judgment of the Commission, to meet present and future water resources needs of the basin. Consideration shall be given to the effect of the plan, or any part of the plan, on the receiving waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The Commission shall consult with interested public bodies and public utilities and fully consider the findings and recommendations of the signatory parties, their various subdivisions and interested groups. Prior to adoption of the plan the Commission shall conduct at least one public hearing in each signatory State.</P>
          <P>(2) The plan will reflect consideration, of the multiobjectives of national economy, regional development and environmental quality; and multipurpose use of projects.</P>
          <P>(3) Water quantity and water quality planning will be studied together and correlated to the extent feasible, with existing and proposed land uses. The development of a basinwide land use study to enable full consideration of basic and alternative proposals to meet water resources needs will be explored.</P>
          <P>(4) An important phase of the plan formulation process is a thorough review and evaluation of the Susquehanna River Basin Coordinating Committee Study report, pertinent plans and reports of the signatories, including water quality standards and other data available. The findings and recommendations presented in the Susquehanna River Basin Coordinating Committee Study report will be considered for incorporation in the Commission's plan to the extent they are feasible and compatible with the current and projected needs and interests.</P>

          <P>(5) Essentially the comprehensive plan will reflect the findings of an analysis of a mix of alternative futures <PRTPAGE P="115"/>for industrial, agricultural, residential, and recreational development in the basin.</P>
          <P>(6) The Commission will act diligently to promote Federal, State, local governmental, and private sector cooperation and coordination in the implementation of the adopted plan. It is expected that recommended development programs will be undertaken by the signatories, local governmental agencies, or private interests. If expeditious action by others is not forthcoming or is not possible the Commission will act in accordance with the Compact to implement programs, projects, and standards to the extent necessary to further the aims of the comprehensive plan.</P>
          <P>(b) The comprehensive plan shall provide for the immediate and long-range use, development, conservation, preservation, and management of the water resources of the basin. The plan will be presented in a form and order as determined by the Commission and shall include, but not be limited to the following:</P>
          <P>(1) Statement of authority, purpose, objectives, and scope.</P>
          <P>(2) Description of the physical and human environment.</P>
          <P>(3) Inventory of the basin's water resources and existing developments and facilities.</P>
          <P>(4) Projection of immediate and long-range water resources needs of the basin.</P>
          <P>(5) Description of a general system of measures and programs, including water quality and other standards as determined necessary, and reasonable alternatives considered essential to and capable of satisfying water resources needs into the reasonably foreseeable future.</P>
          <P>(6) Criteria used for review and acceptance of projects within the plan.</P>
          <P>(7) Procedures for updating and modifying the plan.</P>
          <P>(8) Necessary appendices.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Water supply.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The Susquehanna River Basin is rich in water resources. With proper planning and management, and with adequate public and private investment in treatment, storage, and distribution facilities, the high potential of the basin to provide water of suitable quality for a wide array of public and private purposes into the foreseeable future should be possible.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission may regulate the withdrawal of waters of the basin not regulated by the signatory parties for domestic, municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses if regulation is considered essential to further the aims set forth in the comprehensive plan.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission shall study the basin's water supply needs, the potential surface and ground water resources, and the interrelationships to meet these needs through existing and new facilities and projects. Efficient use and management of existing facilities with emphasis on the full utilization of known technology will be explored in meeting water supply needs for domestic, municipal, agricultural, and industrial water supply before new programs or projects are approved.</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 801.7</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>Water quality.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The signatory States have the primary responsibility in the basin for water quality management and control. However, protection of the water resources of the basin from pollution, and actions by the signatory parties to achieve abatement and control of pollution are important to the Commission.</P>
          <P>(b) The signatory parties have adopted water quality standards for the intra and interstate waters of the basin. Initially these standards will serve as the basis for the Commission's water quality program in the comprehensive plan.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission's role in water quality management and control essentially will be one of coordination to ensure water quality standards are adequate to protect broad public water resources interests, and that uniform policies and enforcement are affected by the signatories.</P>
          <P>(d) The Commission shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Encourage and coordinate efforts of the signatory parties to prevent, reduce, control, and eliminate water pollution and to maintain water quality in accordance with established standards.</P>

          <P>(2) Promote government and private sector implementation of maximum <PRTPAGE P="116"/>practical use of waste utilization and treatment technology.</P>
          <P>(3) Promote and encourage State and local governments and industry to plan for regional waste water treatment and management.</P>
          <P>(4) In cooperation with appropriate agencies of the signatory parties, make periodic inspections to ascertain the state of compliance with appropriate water quality standards, and as needed establish and operate water quality monitoring stations.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Flood plain management and protection.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Periodic inundation of lands along waterways has not discouraged development of flood hazards areas. Major floods cause loss of life, extensive damages, and other conditions not in the public interest. A balanced flood plain management and protection program is needed to reduce the flood hazard to a minimum.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission may regulate the use of flood prone lands with approval of the appropriate signatory party, to safeguard public health, welfare, safety and property, and to sustain economic development.</P>
          <P>(c) To foster sound flood plain controls, as an essential part of water resources management, the Commission shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Encourage and coordinate the efforts of the signatory parties to control modification of the Susquehanna River and its tributaries by encroachment.</P>
          <P>(2) Plan and promote implementation of projects and programs of a structural and nonstructural nature for the protection of flood plains subject to frequent flooding.</P>
          <P>(3) Assist in the study and classification of flood prone lands to ascertain the relative risk of flooding, and establish standards for flood plain management.</P>
          <P>(4) Promote the use of flood insurance by helping localities qualify for the national program.</P>
          <P>(5) Assist in the development of a modern flood forecasting and warning system.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Watershed management.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The character, extent, and quality of water resources of a given watershed are strongly affected by the land use practices within that watershed. Accordingly the Commission will maintain close liaison with Federal, State, and local highway, mining, soil, forest, fish and wildlife, and recreation agencies and with government agencies dealing with urban and residential development programs.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Promote sound practices of watershed management including soil and water conservation measures, land restoration and rehabilitation, erosion control, forest management, improvement of fish and wildlife habitat, and land use in highway, urban, and residential development as related to water resources.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Recreation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) The use of surface water resources of the basin for recreation purposes is extensive. Swimming, fishing, boating, and other water oriented activities have regional and local economic benefit as well as recreational benefit.</P>
          <P>(b) The Commission shall cooperate with public and private agencies in the planning and development of water-related recreation and fish and wildlife programs and projects within the basin and shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Promote public access to and recreational use of existing and future public water areas.</P>
          <P>(2) Promote recreational use of public water supply reservoirs and lakes where adequate treatment of water is provided, and/or where recreational uses are compatible with primary project purposes.</P>
          <P>(3) Include recreation as a purpose where feasible, in multipurpose water use planning of reservoirs and other water bodies.</P>

          <P>(a) The basin has many points of archeological and historic interest, and is well endowed with vistas of aesthetic significance.</P>

          <P>(b) The Commission fully recognizes that the value of these areas cannot be measured simply in economic terms and will strive to preserve and promote <PRTPAGE P="117"/>them for the enjoyment and enrichment of present and future generations.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Seek the advice and assistance of appropriate societies and governmental agencies in the identification of archeological, historic, and scenic areas and unique lands in any planning or development affecting these attributes of the basin.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Electric power generation.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) Significant uses are presently being made of the waters of the basin for the generation of electric power at hydro, pumped storage, and thermoelectric generating stations. Increased demands for electric power throughout the East Coast can be expected to result in proposals for the development of additional electric power generating stations located either in the basin or nearby its borders.</P>
          <P>(b) There appears to be limited site potential in the basin for additional hydroelectric generation, and considerable potential for additional pumped storage and thermoelectric generation. The direct and indirect effects of existing and proposed electric generation projects will be considered by the Commission. Items of concern will include consumptive uses of water, alteration of natural stream regimen, effects on water quality, and on the other uses of the streams affected.</P>
          <P>(c) The Commission, in cooperation with appropriate agencies of the signatory parties, and with other public and private agencies shall:</P>
          <P>(1) Conduct a thorough review of applications to relicense existing electric power generating projects and facilities, and applications to amend existing licenses to determine if the proposal is in accord with the comprehensive plan.</P>
          <P>(2) Require that the proposed siting and location in the basin of any type of electric generating facility or any facility located outside the basin having an effect on the waters of the basin, shall be planned in direct consultation with the Commission to enable advance consideration of the possible effects of such installation on the water resources of the basin.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Public access to records.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The Commission, as an independent compact agency, is not subject to any of its member jurisdictions' laws regarding public access to records. Nevertheless, the Commission wishes to assure, to the maximum extent practicable, the availability of Commission records consistent with the Susquehanna River Basin Compact. The Commission shall maintain an “Access to Records Policy” that outlines the details and procedures related to public access to the Commission's records. Any revisions to this policy shall be consistent with this section and undertaken in accordance with appropriate public notice and comment consistent with requirements of 18 CFR 808.1(b).</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Scope.</E> This section shall apply to all recorded information, regardless of whether the information exists in written or electronic format. There is a strong presumption that records shall be public, except where considerations of privacy, confidentiality, and security must be considered and require thoughtful balancing. The Commission shall identify types of records that are not subject to public access:</P>
          <P>(1) Personnel or employment records, excluding salary information;</P>
          <P>(2) Trade secrets, copyrighted material, or any other confidential business information;</P>
          <P>(3) Records exempted from disclosure by statute, regulation, court order, or recognized privilege;</P>
          <P>(4) Records reflecting internal pre-decisional deliberations, including deliberations between the commission and representatives of member jurisdictions;</P>

          <P>(5) Records reflecting employee medical information, evaluations, tests or other identifiable health information;<PRTPAGE P="118"/>
          </P>
          <P>(6) Records reflecting employee personal information, such as social security number, driver's license number, personal financial information, home addresses, home or personal cellular numbers, confidential personal information, spouse names, marital status or dependent information;</P>
          <P>(7) Investigatory or enforcement records that would interfere with active enforcement proceedings or individual due process rights, disclose the identity of public complainants or confidential sources or investigative techniques or endanger the life or safety of Commission personnel; or</P>
          <P>(8) Records related to critical infrastructure, excluding financial records, emergency procedures, or facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Procedures.</E> The Access to Records Policy will detail the necessary procedures for requesting records and processing records requests:</P>
          <P>(1) Requests shall be in writing and shall be reasonably specific;</P>
          <P>(2) The Commission shall identify an Access to Records Officer to handle requests;</P>
          <P>(3) The Commission shall respond to a records request within a reasonable time and in consideration of available resources and the nature of the request;</P>
          <P>(4) The Commission shall not be required to create a record that does not already exist, or to compile, maintain, format or organize a public record in a manner in which the Commission does not currently practice;</P>
          <P>(5) A procedure shall be identified for electronic transfer, copying or otherwise providing records in a manner that maintains the integrity of the Commission's files; and</P>
          <P>(6) A procedure shall be identified for handling review of requests that seek access to information that has been identified as confidential and for notifying the person(s) who submitted the confidential information that it is subject to a records request.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Fees.</E> The Commission shall adopt and maintain a “Records Processing Fee Schedule.” The fees shall be calculated to reflect the actual costs to the Commission for processing records requests and may include the costs of reproducing records and the cost to search, prepare and/or redact records for extraordinary requests.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Appeals.</E> Any person aggrieved by a Commission action on a records request shall have 30 days to appeal a decision in accordance with 18 CFR 808.2.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Disclosure to consultants, advisory committees, and State and local government officials and employees.</E> Data and information otherwise exempt from public disclosure may be disclosed to Commission consultants, advisory committees, and state and local government officials and employees for use only in their work in cooperation with the Commission. Such persons are thereafter subject to the same restrictions with respect to the disclosure of such data and information as any other Commission employee.</P>

            <P>(a) This part establishes the scope and procedures for review and approval of projects under section 3.10 of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact, Pub. L. 91-575, 84 Stat. 1509, <E T="03">et seq.,</E> (the compact) and establishes special standards under section 3.4(2) of the compact governing water withdrawals, the consumptive use of water, and diversions. The special standards established pursuant to section 3.4(2) shall be applicable to all water withdrawals and consumptive uses in accordance with the terms of those standards, irrespective of whether such withdrawals and uses are also subject to project review under section 3.10. This part, and every other part of 18 CFR chapter VIII, shall also be incorporated into and made a part of the comprehensive plan.</P>
            <P>(b) When projects subject to Commission review and approval are sponsored by governmental authorities, the Commission shall submit recommendations and findings to the sponsoring agency, which shall be included in any report submitted by such agency to its respective legislative body or to any committee thereof in connection with any request for authorization or appropriation therefor. The Commission review will ascertain the project's compatibility with the objectives, goals, guidelines and criteria set forth in the comprehensive plan. If determined compatible, the said project will also be incorporated into the comprehensive plan, if so required by the compact. For the purposes of avoiding conflicts of jurisdiction and of giving full effect to the Commission as a regional agency of the member jurisdictions, no expenditure or commitment shall be made by any governmental authority for or on account of the construction, acquisition or operation of any project or facility unless it first has been included by the Commission in the comprehensive plan.</P>
            <P>(c) If any portion of this part, or any other part of 18 CFR Chapter VIII, shall, for any reason, be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</P>
            <P>(d) Except as otherwise stated in this part, this part shall be effective on January 1, 2007.</P>
            <P>(e) When any period of time is referred to in this part, such period in all cases shall be so computed as to exclude the first and include the last day of such period. Whenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the law of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the computation.</P>

            <P>(f) Any Commission forms or documents referenced in this part may be obtained from the Commission at 4423 North Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17110, or from the Commission's Web site at <E T="03">www.srbc.net.</E>

            <SUBJECT>Purpose of this subpart.</SUBJECT>
            <P>The purpose of this subpart is to set forth general standards that shall be used by the Commission to evaluate all projects subject to review and approval by the Commission pursuant to §§ 806.4, 806.5 and 806.6, and to establish special standards applicable to certain water withdrawals, consumptive uses and diversions. This subpart shall not be construed to limit the Commission's authority and scope of review. These standards are authorized under Sections 3.4(2), 3.4(8), 3.4(9), and 3.10 of the compact and are based upon, but not limited to, the goals, objectives, guidelines and criteria of the comprehensive plan.</P>

            <SUBJECT>General standards.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) A project shall be feasible and not be detrimental to the proper conservation, development, management, or control of the water resources of the basin.</P>
            <P>(b) The Commission may modify and approve as modified, or may disapprove, a project if it determines that the project is not in the best interest of the conservation, development, management, or control of the basin's water resources, or is in conflict with the comprehensive plan.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disapprovals—other governmental jurisdictions.</E> (1) The Commission may suspend the review of any application under this part if the project is subject to the lawful jurisdiction of any member jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof, and such member jurisdiction or political subdivision has disapproved or denied the project. Where such disapproval or denial is reversed on appeal, the appeal is final, and the project sponsor provides the Commission with a certified copy of the decision, the Commission shall resume its review of the application. Where, however, an application has been suspended hereunder for a period greater than three years, the Commission may terminate its review. Thereupon, the Commission shall notify the project sponsor of such termination and that the application fee paid by the project sponsor is forfeited. The project sponsor may reactivate the terminated application by reapplying to the Commission, providing evidence of its receipt of all necessary governmental approvals and, at the discretion of the Commission, submitting new or updated information.</P>
            <P>(2) The Commission may modify, suspend or revoke a previously granted approval if the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain the approval of a member jurisdiction or political subdivision thereof having lawful jurisdiction over the project.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Standards for consumptive uses of water.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The project sponsors of all consumptive water uses subject to review and approval under § 806.4, § 806.5 or § 806.6 of this part shall comply with this section.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Mitigation.</E> All project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval under § 806.4, § 806.5, § 806.6, or § 806.17 shall mitigate such consumptive use. Except to the extent that the project involves the diversion of the waters out of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the requirements of this section. Mitigation may be provided by one or a combination of the following:</P>
            <P>(1) During low flow periods as may be designated by the Commission for consumptive use mitigation.</P>

            <P>(i) Reduce withdrawal from the approved source(s), in an amount equal to the project's consumptive use, and withdraw water from alternative surface water storage or aquifers or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 45 continuous days such <PRTPAGE P="135"/>that impacts to nearby surface waters will not likely be at a magnitude or in a timeframe that would exacerbate present low flow conditions.</P>
            <P>(ii) Release water for flow augmentation, in an amount equal to the project's consumptive use, from surface water storage or aquifers, or other underground storage chambers or facilities approved by the Commission, from which water can be withdrawn for a period of 45 continuous days such that impacts to nearby surface waters will not likely be at a magnitude or in a timeframe that would exacerbate present low flow conditions.</P>
            <P>(iii) Discontinue the project's consumptive use, which may include reduction of the project sponsor's consumptive use to less than 20,000 gpd during periods of low flow. In any case of failure to provide the specified discontinuance, such project shall provide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for the calendar year in which such failure occurs, after which the Commission will reevaluate the continued acceptability of the discontinuance.</P>
            <P>(2) Use, as a source of consumptive use water, surface storage that is subject to maintenance of a conservation release acceptable to the Commission. In any case of failure to provide the specified conservation release, such project shall provide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (3), below, for the calendar year in which such failure occurs, and the Commission will reevaluate the continued acceptability of the conservation release.</P>
            <P>(3) Provide monetary payment to the Commission, for all water consumptively used over the course of a year, in an amount and manner prescribed by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(4) Implement other alternatives approved by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Determination of manner of mitigation.</E> The Commission will, in its sole discretion, determine the acceptable manner of mitigation to be provided by project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and approval. Such a determination will be made after considering the project's location, source characteristics, anticipated amount of consumptive use, proposed method of mitigation and their effects on the purposes set forth in § 806.2 of this part, and any other pertinent factors. The Commission may modify, as appropriate, the manner of mitigation, including the magnitude and timing of any mitigating releases, required in a project approval.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Quality of water released for mitigation.</E> The physical, chemical and biological quality of water released for mitigation shall at all times meet the quality required for the purposes listed in § 806.2, as applicable.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval by rule for consumptive uses</E>—(1) <E T="03">General rule.</E> Except with respect to projects involving hydrocarbon development subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, any project that is solely supplied water for consumptive use by public water supply, stormwater, wastewater, or other reused or recycled water, or any combination thereof, may be approved by the Executive Director under this paragraph (e) in accordance with the following, unless the Executive Director determines that the project cannot be adequately regulated under this approval by rule.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Notification of intent.</E> Prior to undertaking a project or increasing a previously approved quantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall submit a notice of intent (NOI) on forms prescribed by the Commission, and the appropriate application fee, along with any required attachments.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Time of notice.</E> Within 20 days after submittal of an NOI under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the project sponsor shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in § 806.15.</P>

            <P>The Commission, as part of the project review, shall evaluate the proposed methodology for monitoring consumptive uses, water withdrawals and mitigating flows, including flow metering devices, stream gages, and other facilities used to measure the withdrawals or consumptive use of the project or the rate of stream flow. If the Commission determines that additional flow measuring, metering or monitoring devices are required, these shall be provided at the expense of the project sponsor, installed in accordance with a schedule set by the Commission, and installed per the specifications and recommendations of the manufacturer of the device, and shall be subject to inspection by the Commission at any time.</P>
            <P>(a) Project sponsors of projects that are approved under this part shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Measure and record on a daily basis, or such other frequency as may be approved by the Commission, the quantity of all withdrawals, using meters or other methods approved by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(2) Certify, at the time of installation and no less frequently than once every 5 years, the accuracy of all measuring devices and methods to within 5 percent of actual flow, unless specified otherwise by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(3) Maintain metering or other approved methods so as to provide a continuous, accurate record of the withdrawal or consumptive use.</P>
            <P>(4) Measure groundwater levels in all approved production and other wells, as specified by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(5) Measure groundwater levels at additional monitoring locations, as specified by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(6) Measure water levels in surface storage facilities, as specified by the Commission.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Term of approvals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Approvals issued under this part shall have a term equal to the term of any accompanying member jurisdiction approval regulating the same subject matter, but not longer than 15 years, unless an alternate period is provided for in the Commission approval. If there is no such accompanying member jurisdiction approval, or if no term is specified in such accompanying member jurisdiction approval, the term of a Commission approval issued under this part shall be no longer than 15 years or the anticipated life of the project, whichever is less, unless an alternate period is provided for in the Commission approval.</P>
            <P>(b) Commission approval of a project shall expire three years from the date of such approval if the withdrawal, diversion or consumptive use has not been commenced, unless an alternate period is provided for in the docket approval or such 3-year period is extended in writing by the Commission upon written request from the project sponsor submitted no later than 120 days prior to such expiration. The Commission may grant an extension, for a period not to exceed two years, only upon a determination that the delay is due to circumstances beyond the project sponsor's control and that there is a likelihood of project implementation within a reasonable period of time. The Commission may also attach conditions to the granting of such extensions, including modification of any terms of approval that the Commission may deem appropriate.</P>
            <P>(c) If a withdrawal, diversion or consumptive use approved by the Commission for a project is discontinued for a period of five consecutive years, the approval shall be null and void, unless a waiver is granted in writing by the Commission, upon written request by the project sponsor demonstrating due cause and with notification thereof to the member jurisdiction in which the project is located, prior to the expiration of such period.</P>
            <P>(d) If the Commission determines that a project has been abandoned, by evidence of nonuse for a period of time and under such circumstances that an abandonment may be inferred, the Commission may revoke the approval for such withdrawal, diversion or consumptive use.</P>
            <P>(e) If a project sponsor submits an application to the Commission no later than six months prior to the expiration of its existing Commission docket approval or no later than one month prior to the expiration of its existing ABR or NOI approval, the existing approval will be deemed extended until such time as the Commission renders a decision on the application, unless the existing approval or a notification in writing from the Commission provides otherwise.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Reopening/modification.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) Once a project is approved, the Commission, upon its own motion, or upon petition of the project sponsor or any interested party, may at any time reopen any project approval and make additional orders or otherwise modify or impose such additional conditions that may be necessary to mitigate or avoid adverse impacts or to otherwise protect the public health, safety, and welfare or water resources. Whenever a petition for reopening is filed by an interested party, the burden shall be upon that interested party to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a significant adverse impact or a threat to the public health, safety and welfare or water resources exists that warrants reopening of the docket. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any petition filed by a party who previously sought the same or functionally equivalent relief identified in the petition pursuant to the administrative appeals process under § 808.2 will not be eligible for consideration by the Commission absent new facts not known or readily <PRTPAGE P="142"/>discernable at the time of consideration of the petitioner's previous request for administrative appeal filed pursuant to § 808.2.</P>
            <P>(b) If the project sponsor fails to comply with any term or condition of a Commission approval, the Commission may issue an order suspending, modifying or revoking its approval of the project. The Commission may also, in its discretion, suspend, modify or revoke its approval if the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain other federal, state or local approvals.</P>
            <P>(c) For any previously approved project where interference occurs, the Commission may require a project sponsor to provide a temporary source of potable water at the project sponsor's expense, pending a final determination of causation by the Commission.</P>
            <P>(d) The Commission, upon its own motion, may at any time reopen any project approval and make additional corrective modifications that may be necessary.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Administrative appeals.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) A project sponsor or other person aggrieved by a final action or decision of the Executive Director shall file a written appeal with the Commission within 30 days of the receipt of actual notice by the project sponsor or within 30 days of publication of the action in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Appeals shall be filed on a form and in a manner prescribed by the Commission and the petitioner shall have 20 days from the date of filing to amend the appeal. The following is a non-exclusive list of actions by the Executive Director that are subject to an appeal to the Commission:</P>

            <P>(1) A determination that a project requires review and approval under § 806.5;<PRTPAGE P="148"/>
            </P>
            <P>(2) An approval or denial of an application for transfer under § 806.6;</P>
            <P>(3) An approval of a Notice of Intent under a general permit under § 806.17;</P>
            <P>(4) An approval of a minor modification under § 806.18;</P>
            <P>(5) A determination regarding an approval by rule under § 806.22(e) or (f);</P>
            <P>(6) A determination regarding an emergency certificate under § 806.34;</P>
            <P>(7) Enforcement orders issued under § 808.14;</P>
            <P>(8) A finding regarding a civil penalty under § 808.15(c);</P>
            <P>(9) A determination of grandfathered quantity under § 806.44;</P>
            <P>(10) A decision to modify, suspend or revoke a previously granted approval; and</P>
            <P>(11) A records access determination made pursuant to Commission policy.</P>
            <P>(b) The appeal shall identify the specific action or decision being appealed, the date of the action or decision, the interest of the person requesting the hearing in the subject matter of the appeal, and a statement setting forth the basis for objecting to or seeking review of the action or decision.</P>
            <P>(c) Any request not filed on or before the applicable deadline established in paragraph (a) of this section hereof will be deemed untimely and such request for a hearing shall be considered denied unless the Commission, upon written request and for good cause shown, grants leave to make such filing nunc pro tunc; the standard applicable to what constitutes good cause shown being the standard applicable in analogous cases under Federal law. Receipt of requests for hearings pursuant to this section, whether timely filed or not, shall be submitted by the Executive Director to the commissioners for their information.</P>
            <P>(d) Petitioners shall be limited to a single filing that shall set forth all matters and arguments in support thereof, including any ancillary motions or requests for relief. Issues not raised in this single filing shall be considered waived for purposes of the instant proceeding. Where the petitioner is appealing a final determination on a project application and is not the project sponsor, the petitioner shall serve a copy of the appeal upon the project sponsor within five days of its filing.</P>

            <P>(e) The Commission will determine the manner in which it will hear the appeal. If a hearing is granted, the Commission shall serve notice thereof upon the petitioner and project sponsor and shall publish such notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The hearing shall not be held less than 20 days after publication of such notice. Hearings may be conducted by one or more members of the Commission, or by such other hearing officer as the Commission may designate.</P>
            <P>(1) The petitioner may also request a stay of the action or decision giving rise to the appeal pending final disposition of the appeal, which stay may be granted or denied by the Executive Director after consultation with the Commission chair and the member from the affected member State. The decision of the Executive Director on the request for stay shall not be appealable to the Commission under this section and shall remain in full force and effect until the Commission acts on the appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) In addition to the contents of the request itself, the Executive Director, in granting or denying the request for stay, will consider the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Irreparable harm to the petitioner.</P>
            <P>(ii) The likelihood that the petitioner will prevail.</P>
            <P>(f) The Commission shall grant the hearing request pursuant to this section if it determines that an adequate record with regard to the action or decision is not available, or that the Commission has found that an administrative review is necessary or desirable. If the Commission denies any request for a hearing, the party seeking such hearing shall be limited to such remedies as may be provided by the compact or other applicable law or court rule. If a hearing is granted, the Commission shall refer the matter for hearing to be held in accordance with § 808.3, and appoint a hearing officer.</P>

            <P>(g) If a hearing is not granted, the Commission may set a briefing schedule and decide the appeal based on the record before it. The Commission may, <PRTPAGE P="149"/>in its discretion, schedule and hear oral argument on an appeal.</P>

            <P>(h)(1) A request for intervention may be filed with the Commission by persons other than the petitioner within 20 days of the publication of a notice of the granting of such hearing in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The request for intervention shall state the interest of the person filing such notice, and the specific grounds of objection to the action or decision or other grounds for appearance. The hearing officer(s) shall determine whether the person requesting intervention has standing in the matter that would justify their admission as an intervener to the proceedings in accordance with Federal case law.</P>
            <P>(2) Interveners shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</P>
            <P>(i) Where a request for an appeal is made, the 90-day appeal period set forth in section 3.10 (6) and Federal reservation (o) of the compact shall not commence until the Commission has either denied the request for or taken final action on an administrative appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Hearings on administrative appeal.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Commission and the party requesting an administrative appeal under § 808.2 of this part, the following procedures shall govern the conduct of hearing on an administrative appeal.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Hearing procedure.</E> (1) The hearing officer shall have the power to rule upon offers of proof and the admissibility of evidence, to regulate the course of the hearing, to set the location or venue of the hearing, to hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues and the stipulation of facts, to determine the proper parties to the hearing, to determine the scope of any discovery procedures, to delineate the hearing issues to be adjudicated, and to take notice of judicially cognizable facts and general, technical, or scientific facts. The hearing officer may, with the consent of the parties, conduct all or part of the hearing or related proceedings by telephone conference call or other electronic means.</P>
            <P>(2) The hearing officer shall cause each witness to be sworn or to make affirmation.</P>
            <P>(3) Any party to a hearing shall have the right to present evidence, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, submit rebuttal evidence, and to present summation and argument.</P>
            <P>(4) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the hearing, the hearing officer may limit the number of times any witness may testify, the repetitious examination or cross-examination of witnesses, or the extent of corroborative or cumulative testimony.</P>
            <P>(5) The hearing officer shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence, but the parties shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence, and all relevant evidence of reasonably probative value may be received provided it shall be founded upon competent, material evidence which is substantial in view of the entire record.</P>
            <P>(6) Any party may appear and be heard in person or be represented by an attorney at law who shall file an appearance with the Commission.</P>
            <P>(7) Briefs and oral argument may be required by the hearing officer and may be permitted upon request made prior to the close of the hearing by any party. They shall be part of the record unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer.</P>
            <P>(8) The hearing officer may, as he/she deems appropriate, issue subpoenas in the name of the Commission requiring the appearance of witnesses or the production of books, papers, and other documentary evidence for such hearings.</P>

            <P>(9) A record of the proceedings and evidence at each hearing shall be made by a qualified stenographer designated by the Executive Director. Where demanded by the petitioner, or any other person who is a party to the appeal proceedings, or where deemed necessary by the Hearing Officer, the testimony shall be transcribed. In those instances where a transcript of proceedings is made, two copies shall be <PRTPAGE P="150"/>delivered to the Commission. The petitioner or other persons who desire copies shall obtain them from the stenographer at such price as may be agreed upon by the stenographer and the person desiring the transcript.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Staff and other expert testimony.</E> The Executive Director shall arrange for the presentation of testimony by the Commission's technical staff and other experts, as he/she may deem necessary or desirable, to be incorporated in the record to support the administrative action, determination or decision which is the subject of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Written testimony.</E> If the direct testimony of an expert witness is expected to be lengthy or of a complex, technical nature, the presiding officer may order that such direct testimony be submitted to the Commission in sworn, written form. Copies of said testimony shall be served upon all parties appearing at the hearing at least 10 days prior to said hearing. Such written testimony, however, shall not be admitted whenever the witness is not present and available for cross-examination at the hearing unless all parties have waived the right of cross-examination.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Assessment of costs.</E> (1) Whenever a hearing is conducted, the costs thereof, as herein defined, shall be assessed by the presiding officer to the petitioner or such other party as the hearing officer deems equitable. For the purposes of this section, costs include all incremental costs incurred by the Commission, including, but not limited to, hearing officer and expert consultants reasonably necessary in the matter, stenographic record, rental of the hall and other related expenses.</P>
            <P>(2) Upon the scheduling of a matter for hearing, the hearing officer shall furnish to the petitioner a reasonable estimate of the costs to be incurred under this section. The project sponsor may be required to furnish security for such costs either by cash deposit or by a surety bond of a corporate surety authorized to do business in a member state.</P>
            <P>(3) A party to an appeal under this section who desires to proceed in forma pauperis shall submit an affidavit to the Commission requesting the same and showing in detail the assets possessed by the party, and other information indicating the reasons why that party is unable to pay costs incurred under this section or to give security for such costs. The Commission may grant or refuse the request based upon the contents of the affidavit or other factors, such as whether it believes the appeal or intervention is taken in good faith.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Findings and report.</E> The hearing officer shall prepare a report of his/her findings and recommendations based on the record of the hearing. The report shall be served by personal service or certified mail (return receipt requested) upon each party to the hearing or its counsel. Any party may file objections to the report. Such objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on all parties within 20 days after the service of the report. A brief shall be filed together with objections. Any replies to the objections shall be filed and served on all parties within 10 days of service of the objections. Prior to its decision on such objections, the Commission may grant a request for oral argument upon such filing.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Action by the Commission.</E> The Commission will act upon the findings and recommendations of the presiding officer pursuant to law. The determination of the Commission will be in writing and shall be filed in Commission records together with any transcript of the hearing, report of the hearing officer, objections thereto, and all plans, maps, exhibits and other papers, records or documents relating to the hearing.</P>

Pursuant to the additional designation, a hearing officer shall cause to be filed with the department, agency, or instrumentality making the designation, a certified copy of the transcript of the evidence taken before him/her and, if requested, of his/her findings and recommendations. Neither the hearing officer nor the Susquehanna River Basin Commission shall have or exercise any power or duty as a result of such additional designation to decide the merits of any matter arising under the separate laws of a member jurisdiction (other than the compact).</P>

          <P>(a) An investment in a business enterprise in the form of ownership of bonds, notes, and other evidences of indebtness which are not convertible into shares of preferred or common stock and have no warrants attached entitling the holder to purchase stock provided that the estimated market value of the interest does not exceed $5,000;</P>
          <P>(b) An investment in the form of shares in the ownership of enterprises, including preferred and common stocks whether voting or nonvoting, or warrants to purchase such shares, or evidences of indebtedness convertible into such shares provided that the estimated market value of the interest does not exceed $5,000 and does not exceed 1 percent of the estimated market value of all the outstanding shares of the enterprise;</P>
          <P>(c) Shares or investments in a well-diversified money market or mutual fund;</P>
          <P>(d) Vested interests in a pension fund arising out of former employment and to which no further contributions are being made in the employee's behalf, provided that, if the pension plan is a defined benefit plan, the assets of the plan are diversified. For the purpose of this provision, payments are not considered to be made “in the employee's behalf” if they are made solely to maintain adequate plan funding rather than to provide specific benefits for the employee; or</P>
          <P>(e) The interest an employee has by virtue of his or her personal or family use of electric power or through his or her interests in an organization using electric power generated or distributed by TVA, for purposes of his or her official actions at TVA in the process of developing or approving TVA power rate schedules.</P>

            <P>(a) This subpart contains the rules that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed in accordance with TVA's Privacy Act regulations as well as under this subpart.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Proactive disclosures.</SUBJECT>

            <P>Records that the FOIA requires agencies to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the TVA Web site. Each TVA organization is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each TVA organization shall ensure that its posted records and indices are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. TVA has a FOIA Requester Service Center and a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating TVA records. Contact information for the FOIA Requester Service Center and Public Liaison is available at <E T="03">https://www.tva.com/Information/Freedom-of-Information/FOIA-Contacts</E>.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1301.3</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Requirements for making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">General information.</E> (1) TVA has a centralized system for responding to FOIA requests. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Tennessee Valley Authority, FOIA Officer, 400 W. Summit Hill Drive (WT 7D), Knoxville, TN 37902-1401. TVA's Guide to Information, which may be accessed on the TVA Web site at <E T="03">https://www.tva.com/Information/Freedom-of-Information/A-Guide-to-Information-About-The-Tennessee-Valley-Authority</E> may be helpful in making your request.</P>
            <P>(2) If you are making a request about yourself, see subpart B Privacy Act for additional requirements.</P>

            <P>(3) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 <PRTPAGE P="160"/>by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, TVA may require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Description of records sought.</E> Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable TVA personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help TVA identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the TVA's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the agency determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency shall inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the agency's FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Format of records sought.</E> Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records you seek. TVA will accommodate your request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Requester contact information.</E> Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to assist the agency in communicating with them and providing released records.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1301.4</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responsibility for responding to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> TVA's FOIA Officer or the FOIA Officer's designee is responsible for responding to all FOIA requests. In determining which records are responsive to a request, TVA ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the agency will inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Authority to grant or deny requests.</E> TVA's FOIA Officer or the FOIA Officer's designee is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by TVA.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Consultation, referral and coordination.</E> When reviewing records located by TVA in response to a request, TVA will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, TVA shall proceed in one of the following ways:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Consultation.</E> When records originated with the agency processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another agency or other Federal Government office, the agency processing the request should typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Referral.</E> (i) When the agency processing the request believes that a different agency or component is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the agency typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if the agency processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the agency processing the request is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.</P>

            <P>(ii) Whenever an agency refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it must document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral, informing the requester of the name(s) of <PRTPAGE P="161"/>the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Coordination.</E> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the agency that received the request should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Classified information.</E> On receipt of any request involving classified information, the agency must determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving agency must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the agency must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</E> All consultations and referrals received by TVA will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</E> TVA may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.</P>
          </SECTION>
          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1301.5</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Timing of responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> TVA ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt and placement in an appropriate processing track as follows.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Multitrack processing.</E> TVA has established three tracks for handling requests and the track to which a request is assigned will depend on the nature of the request and the estimated processing time. Among the factors TVA may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. TVA will also designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. TVA will advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, will offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Track 1.</E> Requests that can be answered with readily available records or information. These are the fastest to process. These requests ordinarily will be responded to within 20 working days of receipt of a proper request by the FOIA Officer. The 20 working day time limit provided in this paragraph may be extended by TVA for unusual circumstances, as defined in paragraph (c) <PRTPAGE P="162"/>of this section, upon written notice to the person requesting the records.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Track 2.</E> Requests where we need records or information from other offices throughout TVA, where we must consult with other Government agencies, or when we must process a submitter notice as described in § 1301.8(d), but we do not expect that the decision on disclosure will be as time consuming as for requests in Track 3.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Track 3.</E> Requests which require a decision or input from another office or agency, extensive submitter notifications because of the presence of Business Information as defined in § 1301.8(b)(1), and a considerable amount of time will be needed for that, or the request is complicated or involves a large number of records. Usually, these requests will take the longest to process.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Unusual circumstances.</E> Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” and TVA extends the time limit on that basis, TVA will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which TVA estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, TVA will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at <E T="03">https://www.foia.gov/report-makerequest.html</E>. TVA will also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services. As used in this paragraph, “unusual circumstances” means, but only to the extent reasonable necessary to the proper processing of the particular requests:</P>
            <P>(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</P>
            <P>(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</P>
            <P>(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, TVA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. TVA cannot aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Expedited processing.</E> (1) TVA will process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:</P>
            <P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</P>
            <P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;</P>
            <P>(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.</P>
            <P>(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. For a prompt determination, requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section should be submitted to the TVA FOIA Officer. Requests based on paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section should be submitted in accordance with the agency's requirements as described in § 1301.3. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the TVA Chief FOIA Officer and Appeals Official.</P>

            <P>(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. <PRTPAGE P="163"/>For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, TVA may waive the formal certification requirement.</P>
            <P>(4) TVA will notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the agency must act on any appeal of that decision expeditiously.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1301.6</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Responses to requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> TVA, to the extent practicable, will communicate with requesters having access to the Internet electronically, such as email.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Acknowledgments of requests.</E> TVA will acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. TVA will include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Estimated dates of completion and interim responses.</E> Upon request, TVA will provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, TVA may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Grants of requests.</E> Once TVA determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. TVA will also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1301.11 of this subpart and will disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Adverse determinations of requests.</E> If TVA makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing. In the event of an adverse determination, TVA will inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance to requesters.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of denial.</E> The denial must be signed by the head of the agency or their designee and must include:</P>
            <P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;</P>
            <P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the agency in denying the request;</P>
            <P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and</P>
            <P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 1301.9(a) of this subpart, and a description of the appeal requirements.</P>

            <P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available <PRTPAGE P="164"/>from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Markings on released documents.</E> Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted must also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Use of record exclusions.</E> (1) In the event that TVA identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), TVA will confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy, to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.</P>
            <P>(2) If an exclusion is invoked, TVA will maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.</P>

            <SECTNO>§ 1301.7</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Exempt records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) TVA's records will be disclosed to any person upon request as provided in this section, except records that are exempt and are not made available if they are:</P>
            <P>(1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and</P>
            <P>(ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</P>
            <P>(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</P>
            <P>(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute—</P>
            <P>(i)(A) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or</P>
            <P>(B) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and</P>
            <P>(ii) If enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.</P>

            <P>(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;</P>
            <P>(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</P>
            <P>(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information—</P>
            <P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,</P>
            <P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,</P>
            <P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,</P>
            <P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source,</P>
            <P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or</P>
            <P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;</P>

            <P>(b) The availability of certain classes of nonexempt records is deferred for such time as TVA may determine is reasonable necessary to avoid interference with the accomplishment of its statutory responsibilities. Such records include bids and information concerning the identity and number of bids received prior to bid opening and award; and all negotiations in progress involving contracts or agreements for the acquisition or disposal of real or personal property by TVA prior to the conclusion of such negotiations. Any reasonably segregable portion of an available record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this paragraph.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Confidential commercial information.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Confidential commercial information</E> means commercial or financial information obtained by TVA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Submitter</E> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Designation of confidential commercial information.</E> A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">When notice to submitters is required.</E> (1) TVA will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if TVA determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:</P>
            <P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or</P>
            <P>(ii) TVA has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, the agency may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</E> The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:</P>
            <P>(1) TVA determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;</P>
            <P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;</P>
            <P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or</P>
            <P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, TVA will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Opportunity to object to disclosure.</E> (1) TVA will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>

            <P>(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide TVA a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why <PRTPAGE P="166"/>the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential.</P>
            <P>(3) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. TVA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Analysis of objections.</E> TVA will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Notice of intent to disclose.</E> Whenever TVA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, TVA will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:</P>
            <P>(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;</P>
            <P>(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as TVA intends to release them; and</P>
            <P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Notice of FOIA lawsuit.</E> Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, TVA will promptly notify the submitter.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Requester notification.</E> TVA will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Appeals.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Requirements for making an appeal.</E> A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to TVA's office designated to receive FOIA appeals (FOIA Appeals Office). Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 1301.6(e) of this subpart. Requesters can submit appeals by mail to TVA FOIA Appeals Official, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 W. Summit Hill Drive (WT 7C), Knoxville, TN 37902-1401. The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked within 90 calendar days after the date of the initial response. The appeal should clearly identify the agency determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Adjudication of appeals.</E> (1) The TVA Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official or designee will act on all appeals under this section.</P>
            <P>(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.</P>
            <P>(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Chief FOIA Officer and FOIA Appeals Official will take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on appeals.</E> TVA will provide its decision on an appeal in writing. A decision that upholds TVA's determination in whole or in part must contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If TVA's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, TVA will notify the requester of that determination in writing. TVA will then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and will respond directly to the requester.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.</E> Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If TVA agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.<PRTPAGE P="167"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">When appeal is required.</E> Before seeking review by a court of TVA's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Preservation of records.</SUBJECT>
            <P>TVA will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. TVA will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.</P>

          <SECTION>
            <SECTNO>§ 1301.11</SECTNO>
            <SUBJECT>Fees.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">In general.</E> (1) TVA will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:</P>
            <P>(i) Commercial use requesters;</P>
            <P>(ii) Non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and</P>
            <P>(iii) All other requesters.</P>
            <P>(2) Different fees are assessed depending on the category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. TVA will consider requests for fee waivers in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (k) of this section. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, TVA may contact a requester for additional information. TVA will ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. TVA ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Tennessee Valley Authority, or by another method as determined by TVA.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section:</P>
            <P>(1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. TVA's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. TVA will notify requesters of their placement in this category.</P>

            <P>(2) Direct costs are those expenses that TVA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.</P>
            <P>(3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.</P>

            <P>(4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. TVA may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
            </P>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 1.</HD>
              <P>A request from a professor of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 2.</HD>
              <P>A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional stationery.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            <EXAMPLE>
              <HD SOURCE="HED">Example 3.</HD>
              <P>A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.</P>
            </EXAMPLE>
            
            <PRTPAGE P="168"/>
            <P>(5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
            <P>(6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, agencies can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. TVA will advise requesters of their placement in this category.</P>
            <P>(7) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.</P>
            <P>(8) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 1301.7 of this subpart, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Charging fees.</E> In responding to FOIA requests, TVA will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, agencies should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Search.</E> (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. TVA will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.</P>
            <P>(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: For time spent by clerical employees, the charge is $14.90 per hour. For time spent by supervisory and professional employees, the charge is $34.30 per hour.</P>

            <P>(iii) TVA will charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. TVA must notify the requester of the costs associated with <PRTPAGE P="169"/>creating such a program, and the requester must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.</P>
            <P>(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by TVA at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), TVA will charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Duplication.</E> TVA will charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. TVA must honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where TVA can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, TVA will provide one copy per request at the cost of 10 cents per page for sheets no larger than 8<FR>1/2</FR> by 14 inches. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, TVA will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, TVA will charge the direct costs.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Review.</E> TVA will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the review conducted by TVA to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with an agency's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Restrictions on charging fees.</E> (1) When TVA determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.</P>
            <P>(2)(i) If TVA fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in responding to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.</P>
            <P>(ii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.</P>
            <P>(iii) If TVA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, TVA may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. TVA must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and TVA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, TVA may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.</P>
            <P>(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.</P>
            <P>(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.</P>
            <P>(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, TVA must provide without charge:</P>
            <P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and</P>
            <P>(ii) The first two hours of search.<PRTPAGE P="170"/>
            </P>
            <P>(5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</E> (1) When TVA determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, TVA will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, TVA will advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.</P>
            <P>(2) If TVA notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. TVA is not required to accept payments in installments.</P>
            <P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but TVA estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, TVA will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. TVA will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.</P>
            <P>(4) TVA will make available its FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Charges for other services.</E> Although not required to provide special services, if TVA chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Charging interest.</E> TVA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by TVA. TVA must follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</P>
            <P>(h) <E T="03">Aggregating requests.</E> When TVA reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, TVA may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. TVA may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, TVA will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Advance payments.</E> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, TVA cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> payment before copies <PRTPAGE P="171"/>are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.</P>
            <P>(2) When TVA determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. TVA may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.</P>
            <P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any agency within 30 calendar days of the billing date, TVA may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and TVA may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before TVA begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where TVA has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.</P>
            <P>(4) In cases in which TVA requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of TVA's fee determination, the request will be closed.</P>
            <P>(j) <E T="03">Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</E> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, TVA will inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</P>
            <P>(k) <E T="03">Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</E> (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</P>
            <P>(2) TVA will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:</P>
            <P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</P>
            <P>(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:</P>
            <P>(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.</P>
            <P>(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. TVA will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.</P>
            <P>(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, TVA will consider the following criteria:</P>

            <P>(A) TVA must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest <PRTPAGE P="172"/>that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.</P>
            <P>(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, TVA must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. TVA ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied factors paragraphs (k)(2)(i) and (ii), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</P>
            <P>(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.</P>
            <P>(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to TVA and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.</P>

            <P>(a) The regulations in §§ 1301.21 to 1301.34 implement section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, with respect to systems of records maintained by TVA. They provide procedures by which an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Act to determine whether a TVA system contains a record pertaining to him; to gain access to such records; to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof; and to request administrative correction or amendment of such records. They prescribe fees to be charged for copying records; establish identification requirements; list penalties provided by statute for certain violations of the Act; and establish exemptions from certain requirements of the Act for certain TVA systems or components thereof.</P>
            <P>(b) Nothing in §§ 1301.21 to 1301.34 entitles an individual to any access to any information or record compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</P>
            <P>(c) Certain records of which TVA may have physical possession are the official records of another government agency which exercises dominion and control over the records, their content, and access thereto. In such cases, TVA's maintenance of the records is subject to the direction of the other government agency. Except for a request for a determination of the existence of the record, when TVA receives requests related to these records, TVA will immediately refer the request to the controlling agency for all decisions regarding the request, and will notify the individual making the request of the referral.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Procedures for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) An individual may, in accordance with this section (1) request a TVA determination whether a record retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier is maintained in a TVA system, and (2) request access to such a record. A request for determination may be combined with a request for access.</P>
            <P>(b) Requests under this section shall:</P>
            <P>(1) Be in writing and signed by the individual seeking the determination or access;</P>
            <P>(2) Include the individual's mailing address;</P>
            <P>(3) Name the TVA system as listed in the TVA system notice;</P>
            <P>(4) Include any additional identifying information specified in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the applicable TVA system notice;</P>
            <P>(5) Specify whether the request is for determination only or for both determination and access; and</P>
            <P>(6) Include such proof of identity as may be required by § 1301.24 and the applicable system notice. Requests may be presented in person or by mail. In-person requests shall be presented during normal TVA business hours, as set out in § 1301.24(g).</P>
            <P>(c) Requests for determination only shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Notification procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Requests for both determination and access shall be presented to the official designated in the paragraph headed “Access procedure” in the TVA system notice for the TVA system concerned. Certain TVA system notices designate officials at field locations of TVA systems. With respect to such TVA systems, an individual who believes his record is located at the field location may present a request to the designated official at the field location. If the record is not available at that field location, the request will be forwarded to the appropriate TVA office.</P>

            <P>(d) If a request is for determination only, the determination will normally be made within 10 days after receipt of <PRTPAGE P="174"/>the request. If the determination cannot be made within 10 days after receipt of a request, the designated official will acknowledge the request in writing and state when the determination will be made. Upon making a determination, the designated official will notify the individual making the request whether the record exists. The notice will include any additional information necessary to enable the individual to request access to the record.</P>
            <P>(e) A request which includes a request for access will be acknowledged within 10 days after receipt. If access can be granted as requested, the acknowledgment will provide a time and place for disclosure of the requested record. Disclosure will normally be made within 30 days of the date of the acknowledgement, but the designated official may extend the 30-day period for reasons found by him to be good cause. In case of an extension, TVA will notify the individual, in writing, that disclosure will be delayed, the reasons for delay, and the anticipated date on which the individual may expect the record to be disclosed. TVA will attempt to accommodate reasonable requests for disclosure at specified times and dates, as set forth in a request for access, so far as compatible with the conduct of TVA business.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Times, places, and requirements for identification of individuals making requests.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) TVA will require proof of identity, in accordance with this section, before it will disclose a record under § 1301.25 of this part to an individual requesting access to the record, and before it will disclose the existence of a record to a requester under § 1301.23 of this part, if TVA determines that disclosure of the existence of such record would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</P>
            <P>(b) Identification normally required would be an identification card such as a valid state driver's license or TVA or other employee identification card. A comparison of the signature of the requester with either the signature on the card or a signature in the record may be used to confirm identity.</P>
            <P>(c) Because of the sensitivity of the subject matter in a TVA system, a TVA system notice may prescribe special identification requirements for the disclosure of the existence of or access to records in that TVA system. In such case, the special identification requirements prescribed in the TVA system notice shall apply in lieu of those prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) If TVA deems it warranted by the nature of identification presented, the subject matter of the material to be disclosed, or other reasons found by TVA to be sufficient, TVA may require the individual requesting access to sign a statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>
            <P>(e) Where TVA is requested to provide access to records by mailing copies of records to the requester, the request shall contain or be accompanied by adequate identifying information to make it likely the requester is the person he purports to be and a notarized statement asserting identity and stating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses is punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.</P>
            <P>(f) Where sensitivity of record information may warrant (i.e., unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual) or disclosure by mail to third persons is requested, TVA may require in-person confirmation of identity. If in-person confirmation of identity is required, the individual may arrange with the designated TVA official to provide such identification at any of these TVA locations convenient to the individual: Knoxville, Nashville, and Chattanooga, Tennessee; Muscle Shoals, Alabama; Washington, DC, or another location agreed upon by the individual and the designated TVA official. Upon request the TVA official will provide an address and an appropriate time for such identification to be presented.</P>

            <P>(g) In general, TVA offices located in the Eastern Time zone are open 8 a.m. <PRTPAGE P="175"/>to 4:45 p.m., and those in the Central Time zone 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Offices are closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and the following holidays: New Year's Day, Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.</P>

            <P>(a) All disclosure and examination of records shall normally be made in the presence of a TVA representative. If an individual wishes to be accompanied by a third person of the individual's choosing when the record is disclosed, TVA may require the individual to furnish TVA, in advance of disclosure of the record, a statement signed by the individual authorizing discussion and disclosure of the record in the presence of the accompanying person. If desired by the individual, TVA shall provide copies of any documents reviewed in the record which are requested at the time of review. Fees shall be charged for such copies in accordance with the fee schedule in § 1301.31, and shall be payable prior to delivery of the copies to the individual.</P>
            <P>(b) Where permitted by § 1301.24, copies of an individual's record will be made available by mail. A charge for copies will be made in accordance with § 1301.31 of this part. All fees due shall be paid prior to mailing of the materials. However, if TVA is unable to allow in-person review of the record, the first copy will be made available without charge.</P>

            <P>(c) The individual requesting amendment has the responsibility of providing TVA with evidence of why his record should be amended, and must provide adequate evidence to TVA to justify his request.</P>
            <P>(d) The provisions of §§ 1301.21 to 1301.34 of this part do not permit the alteration of evidence presented or to be presented in the course of judicial or administrative proceedings; neither do they permit collateral attack on a prior judicial or administrative action, or provide a collateral remedy for a matter otherwise judicially or administratively cognizable.</P>

            <P>(3) The date on which the denial was issued; and</P>
            <P>(4) The date on which the denial was received by the appellant.</P>
            <P>(b) Appeals shall be determined by a reviewing official. Such determination may be based on information provided for the initial determination; any additional information which TVA or the appellant may desire to provide; and any other material the reviewing official deems relevant to the determination. The reviewing official, in his sole discretion, may request TVA or the appellant to provide additional information deemed relevant to the appeal. The appellant will be given an opportunity to respond to any information provided by TVA or independently procured by the reviewing official. If in the sole discretion of the reviewing official a hearing is deemed necessary for resolution of the appeal, the reviewing official may conduct a hearing upon notice to TVA and the appellant, at which both TVA and the appellant shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the appeal. The rules governing any hearing will be set forth in the notice of hearing.</P>
            <P>(c) The reviewing official shall make final determination on the appeal within 30 days after it is received unless such period is extended for good cause. If the reviewing official finds good cause for an extension, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of the reason for the delay and of the approximate date on which the reviewing official expects to complete his determination of the appeal.</P>

            <P>(d) If the reviewing official determines that a record should be amended in whole or in part in accordance with an appellant's request, TVA will inform the appellant in writing of its determination and correct or amend the record. If an accounting of disclosures has been made, TVA will, to the extent <PRTPAGE P="177"/>of the accounting, inform prior recipients of the record of the fact that the correction was made and of the substance of the correction.</P>
            <P>(e) If the reviewing official determines not to amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with a request, TVA will advise the individual:</P>
            <P>(1) Of its refusal to amend and the reasons therefor;</P>
            <P>(2) Of the appellant's right to file a concise statement of reasons for disagreement with the refusal as set out in paragraph (f) of this section;</P>
            <P>(3) Of the procedures for filing a statement of disagreement;</P>
            <P>(4) That any statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with any statement by TVA summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record;</P>
            <P>(5) That prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of any statement of dispute to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained; and</P>
            <P>(6) Of his or her right to seek judicial review of the agency's refusal to amend a record.</P>
            <P>(f) If the reviewing official's final determination of an appeal is a refusal to correct or amend a record, in whole or in part, in accordance with the request, the appellant may file with TVA a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of TVA to amend the records. Such statements normally should not exceed 100 words. A statement of disagreement should be submitted within 30 days of receipt of notice of the reviewing official's decision on the appeal, and should be sent to system manager. In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement which occurs after the filing of the statement, TVA will clearly note any portion of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement with the disclosure. Copies of the statement will also be furnished to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was made. TVA may attach to the statement of disagreement a brief summary of TVA's reasons for refusing to amend the record. Such summaries will be disclosed to the individual, but are not subject to amendment.</P>

            <P>(a) The TVA system Nuclear Access Authorization and Fitness for Duty Records is exempt from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); and (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 522a (section 3 of the Privacy Act of 1974) to the extent that disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, and to the extent that disclosure of testing or examination material would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. This exemption is pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (k)(5) and (6).</P>
            <P>(b)(1) The TVA systems “Apprentice Training Record System-TVA,” “Consultant and Contractor Records-TVA,” “Employment Applicant Files-TVA,” “Personnel Files-TVA,” and “Nuclear Quality Assurance Personnel Records-TVA” are exempted from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and corresponding sections of these rules to the extent that disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. These TVA systems are exempted pursuant to section (k)(5) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act).</P>
            <P>(2) Each of these TVA systems contain reference letters and information concerning employees and other individuals who perform services for TVA. TVA has received this information in the past under both express and implied promises of confidentiality and consistent with the Privacy Act these promises will be honored. Pledges of confidentiality will be necessary in the future to ensure that unqualified or unsuitable individuals are not selected for TVA positions. Without the ability to make these promises, a potential source of information may be unwilling to provide needed information, or may not be sufficiently frank to be of value in personnel screening.</P>
            <P>(c)(1) The TVA systems “Apprentice Training Record System-TVA,” “Consultant and Contractor Records-TVA,” “Employment Applicant Files-TVA,” and “Personnel Files-TVA,” are exempted from subsections (d); (e)(4)(H); (f)(2), (3), and (4) of 5 U.S.C. 552a and corresponding sections of these rules to the extent that disclosure of testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. These systems are exempted pursuant to section (k)(6) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act).</P>

            <P>(2) This material is exempted because its disclosure would reveal information about the testing process which would potentially give an individual an unfair <PRTPAGE P="179"/>competitive advantage in selection based on test performance.</P>
            <P>(d) The TVA system OIG Investigative Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act) and corresponding sections of these rules pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The TVA system OIG Investigative Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). This system is exempt because application of these provisions might alert investigation subjects to the existence or scope of investigations, lead to suppression, alteration, fabrication, or destruction of evidence, disclose investigative techniques or procedures, reduce the cooperativeness or safety of witnesses, or otherwise impair investigations.</P>
            <P>(e) The TVA system TVA Police Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a (section 3 of the Privacy Act) and corresponding sections of these rules pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The TVA system Police Records is exempt from subsections (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), and (g) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).

            <P>(a) Action under § 1301.46 to close a meeting shall be taken only when a majority of the members vote to take such action. A separate vote shall be taken with respect to each meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to § 1301.46 or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under § 1301.46. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each member participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</P>
            <P>(b) Notwithstanding that the members may have already voted not to close a meeting, whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the agency close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraphs (e), (f), or (g) of § 1301.46, the Board, upon request of any one of its members made prior to the commencement of such portion, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such portion of the meeting.</P>

            <P>(c) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to this section, TVA shall make publicly available in accordance with § 1301.48 a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, TVA shall, within one day of the vote <PRTPAGE P="181"/>taken pursuant to this section, make publicly available in accordance with § 1301.48 a full written explanation of this action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</P>
            <P>(d) Prior to every meeting closed pursuant to § 1301.46, there shall be a certification by the General Counsel of TVA stating whether, in his or her opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification shall be retained by TVA and shall be made publicly available in accordance with § 1301.48.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Requirements for a demand for records or testimony.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Service of demands.</E> Only TVA's General Counsel or his/her designee is authorized to receive and accept demands sought to be served upon TVA or its employees. All such documents should be delivered in person or by United States mail to the Office of the General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 W. Summit Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Time limit for serving demands.</E> The demand must be served at least 30 days prior to the scheduled date of testimony or disclosure of records, in order to ensure that the General Counsel has adequate time to consider the demand and prepare a response, except in cases of routine requests for personnel and payroll records located on-site in Knoxville, where service 15 days prior will normally be considered sufficient. The General Counsel may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement of this paragraph.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Form of Demand.</E> A demand for testimony or production of records or other official information must comply with the following requirements:</P>
            <P>(1) The demand must be in writing and submitted to the General Counsel.</P>
            <P>(2) The demand must include the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved.</P>

            <P>(iv) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs any need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on TVA to produce the documents or testimony.</P>
            <P>(v) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than a TVA employee, such as a retained expert.</P>
            <P>(vi) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Additional information.</E> TVA reserves the right to require additional information to complete the request where appropriate or to waive any of <PRTPAGE P="185"/>the requirements of this section at its sole discretion.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Responding to demands.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Generally, authorization to provide the requested material or testimony shall not be withheld unless their disclosure is prohibited by law or for other compelling reasons, provided the request is reasonable and in compliance with the requirements of this part, and subject to the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Demands for testimony.</E> TVA's practice is to provide requested testimony of TVA employees by affidavit only. TVA will provide affidavit testimony in response to demands for such testimony, provided all requirements of this part are met and there is no compelling factor under paragraph (c) of this section that requires the testimony to be withheld. The General Counsel may waive this restriction when necessary.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Demands for production of records or official information.</E> TVA's practice is to provide requested records or official information, provided all requirements of this part are met and there is no compelling factor under paragraph (c) of this section that requires the records or official information to be withheld.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Factors to be considered in determining whether requested testimony or records or official information must be withheld.</E> The General Counsel shall consider the following factors, among others, in deciding whether requested testimony or materials must be withheld:</P>
            <P>(1) Whether production is appropriate in light of any relevant privilege;</P>
            <P>(2) Whether production is appropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the procedures governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;</P>
            <P>(3) Whether the material requested is relevant to the matter at issue;</P>
            <P>(4) Whether allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;</P>
            <P>(5) Whether disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order, or regulation, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a;</P>
            <P>(6) Whether disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights or national security interests;</P>
            <P>(7) Whether disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets or proprietary confidential information without the owner's consent;</P>
            <P>(8) Whether disclosure would unduly interfere with the orderly conduct of TVA's functions;</P>
            <P>(9) Whether the records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;</P>
            <P>(10) Whether disclosure would result in TVA appearing to favor one litigant over another;</P>
            <P>(11) Whether the demand or request is within the authority of the party making it; and</P>
            <P>(12) Whether a substantial Government interest is implicated.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Restrictions on testimony or production of records or official information.</E> When necessary or appropriate, the General Counsel may impose restrictions or conditions on the production of testimony or records or official information. These restrictions may include, but are not limited to:</P>
            <P>(1) Limiting the area of testimony;</P>
            <P>(2) Requiring that the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding agree to keep the testimony under seal;</P>
            <P>(3) Requiring that the testimony be used or made available only in the legal proceeding for which it was requested;</P>
            <P>(4) Requiring that the parties to the legal proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure of produced records or official information.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Fees for Production.</E> Fees will be charged for production of TVA records and information. The fees will be the same as those charged by TVA pursuant to its Freedom of Information Act regulations, 16 CFR 1301.10.</P>

All final determinations are <PRTPAGE P="186"/>within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requesting party and, when necessary, the court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the production of testimony or records or official information.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>
          <P>The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act 1964 (hereafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from TVA.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Application of this part.</SUBJECT>
          <P>This part applies to any program for which financial assistance is provided by TVA. The types of Federal financial assistance to which this part applies are listed in appendix A of this part. Financial assistance, as used in this part, includes the grant or loan of money; the donation of real or personal property; the sale, lease, or license of real or personal property for a consideration which is nominal or reduced for the purpose of assisting the recipient; the waiver of charges which would normally be made, in order to assist the recipient; the entry into a contract where a purpose is to give financial assistance to the contracting party; and similar transactions. This part does not apply to:</P>
          <P>(a) Any financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts,</P>
          <P>(b) Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part,</P>
          <P>(c) Any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or</P>
          <P>(d) Any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, unless such practice exists in a program where a primary objective of the TVA financial assistance is to provide employment; or where such practice subjects persons to discrimination in the provision of services and benefits on the grounds of race, color, or national origin in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA.</P>

          <FP>The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A shall not mean, if Title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance may be added to <PRTPAGE P="189"/>this list by notice published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

          <P>(2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.</P>
          <P>(3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this regulation.</P>

          <P>(6) This regulation does not prohibit the consideration of race, color, or national origin if the purpose and effect are to remove or overcome the consequences of practices or impediments which have restricted the availability of, or participation in, the program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this regulation applies, the recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purposes of the Act.</P>

          <P>(a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with this part in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or in <PRTPAGE P="191"/>the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreements, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.</P>
          <P>(b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which is acquired with Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Compliance reviews and conduct of investigations.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Preaward compliance reviews.</E> (1) Prior to approval of financial assistance, TVA will make a determination as to whether the proposed recipient is in compliance with Title VI and the requirements of this part with respect to a program or activity for which it is seeking Federal financial assistance from TVA. The basis for such a determination shall be submission of an assurance of compliance and a review of the data and information submitted by the proposed recipient, any relevant compliance review reports on file with TVA, and any other information available to TVA. Where a determination cannot be made from this data, TVA will require the submission of necessary additional information and may take additional steps. Such additional steps may include, for example, communicating with local government officials, protected class organizations, and onsite reviews.</P>
          <P>(2) No proposed recipient shall be approved unless it is determined that the proposed recipient is in compliance with Title VI and this part or has agreed in writing to take necessary specified steps within a stated period of time to come into compliance with Title VI and this part. Such an agreement must be approved by TVA and made a part of the conditions of the agreement under which the financial assistance is provided.</P>
          <P>(3)(i) Where TVA finds that a proposed recipient may not be in compliance with Title VI and this part, TVA shall notify the proposed recipient and the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in writing of:</P>
          <P>(A) The preliminary findings setting forth the alleged noncompliance;</P>
          <P>(B) Suggested actions for correcting the alleged noncompliance; and</P>
          <P>(C) The fact that the proposed recipient has 10 days to correct the alleged noncompliance or to provide during this time a written submission responding to or rebutting the preliminary findings or suggested corrective actions set forth in the notice.</P>
          <P>(ii) If within this 10-day period the proposed recipient has not agreed to the suggested actions set forth or to other actions that would correct the alleged noncompliance under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section, or the preliminary findings set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section have not been rebutted to TVA's satisfaction, or voluntary compliance has not been otherwise secured, TVA shall make a formal determination of compliance or noncompliance, notify the proposed recipient, and the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and institute proceedings (including provision of an opportunity for a hearing) under § 1302.8 of this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Postaward compliance reviews.</E> (1) TVA may periodically conduct compliance reviews of selected recipients in their programs or activities receiving TVA financial assistance, including the request of data and information, and may conduct onsite reviews where it has reason to believe that discrimination may be occurring in such programs or activities.</P>
          <P>(2) Selection for review shall be made on the basis of the following criteria among others:</P>
          <P>(i) The number and nature of discrimination complaints filed against a recipient with TVA or other Federal agencies;</P>

          <P>(ii) The scope of the problem revealed by an investigation commenced on the basis of a complaint filed with TVA against a recipient; and<PRTPAGE P="193"/>
          </P>
          <P>(iii) The amount of assistance provided to the recipient.</P>
          <P>(3) Within 15 days after selection of a recipient for review, TVA shall inform the recipient that it has been selected for review. The review will ordinarily be initiated by a letter requesting data pertinent to the review and advising the recipient of:</P>
          <P>(i) The practices to be reviewed;</P>
          <P>(ii) The programs or activities affected by the review;</P>
          <P>(iii) The opportunity to make, at any time prior to receipt of the final TVA findings with respect to the review pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a documentary submission responding to TVA which explains, validates, or otherwise addresses the practices under review; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The schedule under which the review will be conducted and a determination of compliance or noncompliance made.</P>
          <P>(4) Within 180 days of initiation of a review, TVA shall advise the recipient, in writing of:</P>
          <P>(i) Its preliminary findings;</P>
          <P>(ii) Where appropriate, recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance;</P>
          <P>(iii) The opportunity to request TVA to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations prior to TVA's final determination of compliance or noncompliance. TVA shall notify the Assistant Attorney General at the time it notifies the recipient of any matter where recommendations for achieving voluntary compliance are made.</P>
          <P>(5) TVA's General Manager may extend the 180-day period set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for good cause shown.</P>
          <P>(6) If, within 50 days of the recipient's notification under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, TVA's recommendations for compliance are not met or voluntary compliance is not secured, and the preliminary findings have not been rebutted to TVA's satisfaction, TVA shall make a final determination of compliance or noncompliance. The determination is to be made no later than 14 days after the conclusion of the 50-day negotiation period. TVA's General Manager may extend the 14-day period for good cause shown.</P>
          <P>(7) Where TVA makes a formal determination of noncompliance on a postaward review, the recipient and the Assistant Attorney General shall be immediately notified in writing of the determination and of the fact that the recipient has an additional 10 days in which to come into voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance has not been achieved within the 10 days, TVA shall institute proceedings under § 1302.8 of this part.</P>
          <P>(8) All agreements to come into voluntary compliance shall be in writing and signed by TVA and an official who has authority to legally bind the recipient.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Complaint investigation.</E> (1) TVA shall investigate complaints of discrimination in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from TVA that allege a violation of Title VI or this part.</P>
          <P>(2) No complaint will be investigated if it is received by TVA more than 180 days after the date of the alleged discrimination unless the time for filing is extended by TVA for good cause shown.

          <P>(D) The schedule under which the complaint will be investigated and a determination of compliance or noncompliance made.</P>
          <P>(iii) Within 180 days of the initiation of a complaint investigation, TVA shall advise the recipient, in writing, of:</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedure for effecting compliance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this regulation may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to,</P>
          <P>(1) A reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act),</P>
          <P>(2) Institution of appropriate proceedings by TVA to enforce the provisions of the agreement of financial assistance or of any deed or instrument relating thereto, and</P>
          <P>(3) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
          <FP>The Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, Department of Justice, will be notified of all findings of probable noncompliance at the same time the recipient or applicant is notified.</FP>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 1302.5.</E> If anyone requesting financial assistance declines to furnish the assurance required under § 1302.5 of this part, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section and for such purposes, the term “recipient” shall be deemed to include one which has been denied financial assistance. TVA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that TVA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an agreement therefor entered into with TVA prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue financial assistance shall become effective until (1) TVA has advised the recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, or a failure by the recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the TVA Board pursuant to § 1302.9, and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the TVA Board has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) TVA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from <PRTPAGE P="196"/>the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with the regulation and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Hearings.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1302.7(b), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected recipient. This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1302.7(b) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the TVA Board, or a member thereof, or, at the discretion of the Board, before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the recipient and TVA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with the procedures contained in 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act) and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>
          <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or Joint Hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the TVA <PRTPAGE P="197"/>Board may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedure not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1302.9.</P>

A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner, the recipient may file exceptions to the initial decision, together with a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions and statement shall be filed with the TVA Board within 30 days of the date the notice of initial decision was mailed to the recipient. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that the TVA Board will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the TVA Board shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Decisions on record or review by the TVA Board.</E> Whenever a record is certified to the TVA Board for decision or it reviews the decision of a member of the TVA Board or a hearing examiner pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the TVA Board conducts the hearing, the recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the Board briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the Board shall be given in writing to the recipient and to the complainant, if any.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.</E> Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 1302.8(a) a decision shall be made by the TVA Board on the record and a copy of such decision shall be given to the recipient, and to the complainant, if any.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Rulings required.</E> Each decision shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the recipient has failed to comply.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Approval by TVA Board.</E> Any final decision (other than a decision by the TVA Board) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this regulation or the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the TVA Board, which may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Content of orders.</E> The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Posttermination proceedings.</E> (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.<PRTPAGE P="198"/>
          </P>
          <P>(2) Any recipient or proposed recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request TVA to restore fully the recipient's eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, TVA shall restore such eligibility.</P>
          <P>(3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a written request for a hearing specifying why it believes TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient will be restored to such eligibility if the recipient proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Scope and intent.</SUBJECT>

            <P>The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 among other things confers on TVA broad authority related to the unified conservation and development of the Tennessee River Valley and surrounding area and directs that property in TVA's custody be used to promote the Act's purposes. In particular, section 26a of the Act requires that TVA's approval be obtained prior to the construction, operation, or maintenance of any dam, appurtenant works, or other obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations along or in the Tennessee River or any of its tributaries. By way of example only, such obstructions may include boat docks, piers, boathouses, buoys, floats, boat launching ramps, fills, water intakes, devices for discharging effluent, bridges, aerial cables, culverts, pipelines, fish attractors, shoreline stabilization projects, channel excavations, and floating cabins as described in § 1304.101. Any person considering constructing, operating, or maintaining any such obstruction on a stream in the Tennessee River Watershed should carefully review the regulations in this part and the 26a Applicant's Package before doing so. The regulations also apply to certain activities on TVA-owned land alongside TVA reservoirs and to land subject to TVA flowage easements. TVA uses and permits use of the lands and land rights in its custody alongside and subjacent to TVA reservoirs and exercises its land rights to carry out the purposes and policies of the Act. In addition, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1251 <E T="03">et seq.,</E> have declared it to be congressional policy that agencies should administer their statutory authorities so as to restore, preserve, and enhance the quality of the environment and should cooperate in the control of pollution. It is the intent of the regulations in this part 1304 to carry out the purposes of the Act and other statutes relating to these purposes, and this part shall be interpreted and applied to that end.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Application.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If the facility is to be built on TVA land, the applicant must, in addition to the other requirements of this part, own the fee interest in or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest of sufficient tenure to cover the normal useful life of the proposed facility in land immediately adjoining the TVA land. If the facility is to be built on private land, the applicant must own the fee interest in the land or have an adequate leasehold or easement interest in the property where the facility will be located. TVA recognizes, however, that in some cases private property has been subdivided in a way that left an intervening strip of land between the upland boundary of a TVA flowage easement and the waters of the <PRTPAGE P="201"/>reservoir, or did not convey to the adjoining landowner the land underlying the waters of the reservoir. In some of these situations, the owner of the intervening strip or underlying land cannot be identified or does not object to construction of water-use facilities by the adjacent landowner. In these situations, TVA may exercise its discretion to permit the facility, provided there is no objection from the fee owner of the intervening strip or underlying land. A TVA permit conveys no property interest. The applicant is responsible for locating the proposed facility on qualifying land and ensuring that there is no objection from any owner of such land. TVA may require the applicant to provide appropriate verification of ownership and lack of objection, but TVA is not responsible for resolving ownership questions. In case of a dispute, TVA may require private parties requesting TVA action to grant or revoke a TVA permit to obtain a court order declaring respective land rights. TVA may exercise its discretion to permit a facility on TVA land that is located up or downstream from the land which makes the applicant eligible for consideration to receive a permit.</P>

            <P>This subpart prescribes requirements for floating cabins on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins as applied to this subpart include existing nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA and other existing structures, whose design and use is primarily for human habitation or occupation and not for navigation or transportation on the water. Floating cabins that were not located or moored on the Tennessee River System on or before December 16, 2016, shall be deemed new floating cabins. New floating cabins are prohibited and subject to the removal provisions of this part and Section 9b of the TVA Act. No new floating cabins shall be moored, anchored, or installed on the Tennessee River System. Floating cabins that were located or moored in the Tennessee River System on or before December 16, 2016 shall be deemed existing floating cabins. Existing floating cabins may remain moored on the Tennessee River System provided they remain in compliance with the rules in this part.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Floating cabins.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a)(1) Floating cabins include nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA on or before December 16, 2016, and other floating structures moored on the Tennessee River System as of this date, and determined by TVA in its sole discretion to be designed and used <PRTPAGE P="207"/>primarily for human habitation or occupation and not designed and used primarily for navigation or transportation on the water. TVA's judgment will be guided by, but not limited to, the following factors:</P>
            <P>(i) Whether the structure is usually kept at a fixed mooring point;</P>
            <P>(ii) Whether the structure is actually used on a regular basis for transportation or navigation;</P>
            <P>(iii) Whether the structure has a permanent or continuous connection to the shore for electrical, plumbing, water, or other utility service;</P>
            <P>(iv) Whether the structure has the performance characteristics of a vessel typically used for navigation or transportation on water;</P>
            <P>(v) Whether the structure can be readily removed from the water;</P>
            <P>(vi) Whether the structure is used for intermittent or extended human-habitation or occupancy;</P>
            <P>(vii) Whether the structure clearly has a means of propulsion, and appropriate power/size ratio;</P>
            <P>(viii) Whether the structure is safe to navigate or use for transportation purposes.</P>
            <P>(2) That a structure could occasionally move from place to place, or that it qualifies under another federal or state regulatory program as a vessel or boat, are factors that TVA also will consider but would not be determinative. Floating cabins are not recreational vessels to which § 1304.409 applies.</P>
            <P>(b)(1) Owners of floating cabins are required to register the floating cabin with TVA before January 1, 2020. Floating cabin owners must submit certain required information with their registration. Registration shall include the following information: Clear and current photographs of the structure; a drawing or drawings showing in reasonable detail the size and shape of the floating cabin (length, width, and height) and attached structures, such as decks or slips (length, width, and height); and a completed and signed TVA registration form. The completed TVA registration form shall include the mailing and contact information of the owner(s); the TVA permit or TVA-issued numbers (when applicable); the mooring location of the floating cabin; how the floating cabin is moored; how electrical service is provided; how waste water and sewage is managed; and an owner's signature.</P>
            <P>(2) Existing floating cabins may remain on TVA reservoirs provided they stay in compliance with the rules contained in this part and pay any necessary and reasonable fees levied by TVA to ensure compliance with TVA's regulations. Existing floating cabins must be moored at one of the following locations:</P>
            <P>(i) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin is the owner or lessee (or the licensee of such owner or lessee) of the proposed mooring location provided the floating cabin was moored at such location prior to December 16, 2016;</P>
            <P>(ii) At locations described by § 1304.201(a)(1), (2), and (3) provided the floating cabin was moored at such location prior to December 16, 2016;</P>
            <P>(iii) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin obtained written approval from TVA pursuant to subpart A of this part authorizing mooring at such location on or before December 16, 2016; or</P>
            <P>(iv) Within the designated and approved harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. As provided in § 1304.404, TVA may adjust harbor limits and require relocation of an existing floating cabin within the harbor limits. Accordingly, in the case of relocations that occur after December 16, 2016, an existing floating cabin can relocate only to the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404.</P>
            <P>(3) All floating cabins must be moored in such a manner as to:</P>
            <P>(i) Avoid obstruction of or interference with navigation, flood control, public lands or reservations;</P>
            <P>(ii) Avoid adverse effects on public lands or reservations;</P>
            <P>(iii) Prevent the preemption of public waters when moored in permanent locations outside of the approved harbor limits of commercial marinas;</P>

            <P>(iv) Protect land and landrights owned by the United States alongside and subjacent to TVA reservoirs from trespass and other unlawful and unreasonable uses; and<PRTPAGE P="208"/>
            </P>
            <P>(v) Maintain, protect, and enhance the quality of the human environment.</P>
            <P>(c) All approved floating cabins with toilets must be equipped as follows with a properly installed and operating Marine Sanitation Device (MSD) or Sewage Holding Tank and pumpout capability:</P>
            <P>(1) Floating cabins moored on “Discharge Lakes” must be equipped with a Type I or Type II MSD.</P>
            <P>(2) Floating cabins moored in: “No Discharge Lakes” must be equipped with holding tanks and pumpout capability. If a floating cabin moored in a “No Discharge Lake” is equipped with a Type I or Type II MSD, it must be secured to prevent discharge into the lake.</P>
            <P>(d) Existing floating cabins shall be maintained in a good state of repair and may be maintained without additional approval from TVA. Existing floating cabins may be rebuilt to the same configuration, total footprint, and dimensions (length, width, and height) as permitted without additional TVA approval. Owners are required to notify TVA thirty days in advance and submit their proposed plans for rebuilding the floating cabin. Within thirty days of completion, owners must submit a photo of the rebuilt floating cabin for TVA's records. Any expansion in length, width, or height is prohibited, except as approved in writing by TVA and necessary to comply with health, safety, and environmental requirements.</P>
            <P>(e) All floating cabins shall comply with the requirements for flotation devices contained in § 1304.400.</P>
            <P>(f) Applications for mooring of a floating cabin outside of designated harbor limits will be disapproved if TVA determines that the proposed mooring location would be contrary to the intent of this subpart.</P>
            <P>(g) All floating cabins not in compliance with this part are subject to the applicable removal provisions of § 1304.406 and Section 9b of the TVA Act.</P>

            <P>This subpart addresses residential-related (all private, noncommercial uses) construction activities along and across shoreland property owned by the United States and under the custody and control of TVA. Individual residential landowners wishing to construct <PRTPAGE P="209"/>facilities, clear vegetation and/or maintain an access corridor on adjacent TVA-owned lands are required to apply for and obtain a permit from TVA before conducting any such activities.</P>

            <P>(a) This subpart applies to the following TVA-reservoir shoreland classifications:
            </P>
            <P>(1) TVA-owned shorelands over which the adjacent residential landowner holds rights of ingress and egress to the water (except where a particular activity is specifically excluded by an applicable real estate document), including, at TVA's discretion, cases where the applicant owns access rights across adjoining private property that borders on and benefits from rights of ingress and egress across TVA-owned shoreland.</P>
            <P>(2) TVA-owned shorelands designated in current TVA Reservoir Land Management Plans as open for consideration of residential development; and</P>
            <P>(3) On reservoirs not having a current approved TVA Reservoir Land Management Plan at the time of application, TVA-owned shorelands designated in TVA's property forecast system as “reservoir operations property,” identified in a subdivision plat recorded prior to September 24, 1992, and containing at least one water-use facility developed prior to September 24, 1992.</P>
            <P>(b) Construction of structures, access corridors, and vegetation management activities by owners of adjacent upland residential property shall not be allowed on any TVA-owned lands other than those described in one or more of the classifications identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) Flowage easement shoreland. Except as otherwise specifically provided in subpart D of this part, this subpart C does not apply to shoreland where TVA's property interest is ownership of a flowage easement.

            <P>(a) Except for the mowing of lawns established and existing before November 1, 1999, all vegetation management activities on TVA-owned property subject to this subpart (including all such activities described in paragraphs (b) through (m) of this section as “allowed” and all activities undertaken in connection with a section 26a permit obtained before September 8, 2003) require TVA's advance written permission. Special site circumstances such as the presence of wetlands may result in a requirement for mitigative measures or alternative vegetation management approaches.</P>
            <P>(b) Vegetation may be cleared to create and maintain an access corridor up to but not exceeding 20 feet wide. The corridor will extend from the common boundary between TVA and the adjacent landowner to the water-use facility.</P>
            <P>(c) The access corridor will be located to minimize removal of trees or other vegetation on the TVA land.</P>
            <P>(d) Grass may be planted and mowed within the access corridor, and stone, brick, concrete, mulch, or wooden paths, walkways and/or steps are allowed. Pruning of side limbs that extend into the access corridor from trees located outside the access corridor is allowed.</P>

            <P>(e) A 50-foot-deep shoreline management zone (SMZ) shall be designated by TVA on TVA property; provided, <PRTPAGE P="210"/>however, that where TVA ownership is insufficient to establish a 50-foot-deep SMZ, the SMZ shall consist only of all of the TVA land at the location (private land shall not be included within the SMZ). Within the SMZ, no trees may be cut or vegetation removed, except that which is preapproved by TVA within the access corridor.</P>
            <P>(f) Within the 50-foot SMZ and elsewhere on TVA land as defined in § 1304.201, clearing of specified understory plants (poison ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, kudzu, and other exotic plants on a list provided by TVA) is allowed.</P>
            <P>(g) On TVA land situated above the SMZ, selective thinning of trees or other vegetation under three inches in diameter at the ground level is allowed.</P>
            <P>(h) Removal of trees outside of the access corridor but within the SMZ may be approved to make the site suitable for approved shoreline erosion control projects.</P>
            <P>(i) Vegetation removed for erosion control projects must be replaced with native species of vegetation.</P>
            <P>(j) The forest floor must be left undisturbed, except as specified in this section. Mowing is allowed only within the access corridor.</P>
            <P>(k) Planting of trees, shrubs, wildflowers, native grasses, and ground covers within the SMZ is allowed to create, improve, or enhance the vegetative cover, provided native plants are used.</P>
            <P>(l) Fertilizers and herbicides shall not be applied within the SMZ or elsewhere on TVA land, except as specifically approved in the Vegetative Management Plan.</P>
            <P>(m) Restricted use herbicides and pesticides shall not be applied on TVA-owned shoreland except by a State certified applicator. All herbicides and pesticides shall be applied in accordance with label requirements.</P>

Flotation materials shall be resistant to puncture, penetration, damage by animals, and fire. Any flotation within 40 feet of a line carrying fuel shall be 100 percent impervious to water and fuel. Styrofoam floatation must be fully encased. Reuse of plastic, metal, or other previously used drums or containers for encasement or flotation purpose is prohibited, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section for certain metal drums already in use. Existing flotation (secured in place prior to September 8, 2003) in compliance with previous rules is authorized until in TVA's judgment the flotation is no longer serviceable, at which time it shall be replaced with approved flotation upon notification from TVA. For any float installed after September 8, 2003, repair or replacement is required when it no longer performs its designated function or exhibits any of the conditions prohibited by this subpart.</P>
            <P>(b) Because of the possible release of toxic or polluting substances, and the hazard to navigation from metal drums that become partially filled with water and escape from docks, boathouses, houseboats, floats, and other water-use structures and facilities for which they are used for flotation, the use of metal drums in any form, except as authorized in paragraph (c) of this section, for flotation of any facilities is prohibited.</P>
            <P>(c) Only metal drums which have been filled with plastic foam or other solid flotation materials and welded, strapped, or otherwise firmly secured in place prior to July 1, 1972, on existing facilities are permitted. Replacement of any metal drum flotation permitted to be used by this paragraph must be with a commercially manufactured flotation device or material specifically designed for marine applications (for example, pontoons, boat hulls, or other buoyancy devices made of steel, aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic foam, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section).</P>
            <P>(d) Every flotation device employed in the Tennessee River system must be firmly and securely affixed to the structure it supports with materials capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to wave wash and weather conditions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fuel storage tanks and handling facilities.</SUBJECT>
            <P>Fuel storage tanks and handling facilities are generally either underground (UST) or aboveground (AST) storage tank systems. An UST is any one or combination of tanks or tank systems defined in applicable Federal or State regulations as an UST. Typically (unless otherwise provided by applicable Federal or State rules), an UST is used to contain a regulated substance (such as a petroleum product) and has 10 percent or more of its total volume beneath the surface of the ground. The total volume includes any piping used in the system. An UST may be a buried tank, or an aboveground tank with buried piping if the piping holds 10 percent or more of the total system volume including the tank. For purposes of this part, an aboveground storage tank (AST) is any storage tank whose total volume (piping and tank) is less than 10 percent underground or any storage tank defined by applicable law or regulation as an AST.</P>

            <P>(a) TVA requires the following to be included in all applications submitted after September 8, 2003 to install an <PRTPAGE P="218"/>UST or any part of an UST system below the 500-year flood elevation on a TVA reservoir, or regulated tailwater:</P>
            <P>(1) A copy of the State approval for the UST along with a copy of the application sent to the State and any plans or drawings that were submitted for the State's review;</P>
            <P>(2) Evidence of secondary containment for all piping or other systems associated with the UST;</P>
            <P>(3) Evidence of secondary containment to contain leaks from gas pump(s);</P>
            <P>(4) Calculations certified by a licensed, professional engineer in the relevant State showing how the tank will be anchored so that it does not float during flooding; and</P>
            <P>(5) Evidence, where applicable, that the applicant has complied with all spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) requirements.</P>
            <P>(b) The applicant must accept and sign a document stating that the applicant shall at all times be the owner of the UST system, that TVA shall have the right (but no duty) to prevent or remedy pollution or violations of law, including removal of the UST system, with costs charged to the applicant, that the applicant shall at all times maintain and operate the UST system in full compliance with applicable Federal, State, and local UST regulations, and that the applicant shall maintain eligibility in any applicable State trust fund.</P>
            <P>(c) An application to install an AST or any part of an AST system below the 500-year elevation on a TVA reservoir or a regulated tailwater is subject to all of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section except that paragraph (a)(1) shall not apply in States that do not require application or approval for installation of an AST. Eligibility must be maintained for any applicable AST trust fund, and the system must be maintained and operated in accordance with any applicable AST regulations. The applicant must notify and obtain any required documents or permission from the State fire marshal's office prior to installation of the AST. The applicant must also follow the National Fire Protection Association Codes 30 and 30A for installation and maintenance of flammable and combustible liquids storage tanks at marine service stations.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Fuel handling on private, non-commercial docks and piers.</E> TVA will not approve the installation, operation, or maintenance of fuel handling facilities on any private, non-commercial dock or pier.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Floating fuel handling facilities.</E> TVA will not approve the installation of any floating fuel handling facility or fuel storage tank.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Demonstration of financial responsibility.</E> Applicants for a fuel handling facility to be located in whole or in part on TVA land shall be required to provide TVA, in a form and amount acceptable to TVA, a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, pollution liability insurance, or other evidence of financial responsibility in the event of a release.</P>

            <P>If, at any time, any dock, wharf, boathouse (fixed or floating), floating cabin, outfall, aerial cable, or other fixed or floating structure or facility (including any navigable boat or vessel that has become deteriorated and is a potential navigation hazard or impediment to flood control) is anchored, installed, constructed, or moored in a manner inconsistent with this part, or is not constructed in accordance with plans approved by TVA, or is not maintained or operated so as to remain in accordance with this part and such plans, or is not kept in a good state of repair and in good, safe, and substantial condition, and the owner or operator thereof fails to repair or remove such structure (or operate or maintain it in accordance with such plans) within ninety (90) days after written notice from TVA to do so, TVA may cancel any license, permit, or approval and remove such structure, and/or cause it to be removed, from the Tennessee River system and/or lands in the custody or control of TVA. Such written notice may be given by mailing a copy thereof to the owner's address as listed on the license, permit, or approval or by posting a copy on the structure or facility. TVA may remove or cause to be removed any such structure or facility <PRTPAGE P="219"/>anchored, installed, constructed, or moored without such license, permit, or approval, whether such license or approval has once been obtained and subsequently canceled, or whether it has never been obtained. TVA's removal costs shall be charged to the owner of the structure, and payment of such costs shall be a condition of approval for any future facility proposed to serve the tract of land at issue or any tract derived therefrom whether or not the current owner caused such charges to be incurred. In addition, any applicant with an outstanding removal charge payable to TVA shall, until such time as the charge be paid in full, be ineligible to receive a permit or approval from TVA for any facility located anywhere along or in the Tennessee River or its tributaries. TVA shall not be responsible for the loss of property associated with the removal of any such structure or facility including, without limitation, the loss of any navigable boat or vessel moored at such a facility. Any costs voluntarily incurred by TVA to protect and store such property shall be removal costs within the meaning of this section, and TVA may sell such property and apply the proceeds toward any and all of its removal costs.

            <SUBJECT>Development within flood control storage zones of TVA reservoirs.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Activities involving development within the flood control storage zone on TVA reservoirs will be reviewed to determine if the proposed activity qualifies as a repetitive action. Under TVA's implementation of Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management, repetitive actions are projects within a class of actions TVA has determined to be approvable without further review and documentation related to flood control storage, provided the loss of flood control storage caused by the project does not exceed one acre-foot. A partial list of repetitive actions includes:</P>
            <P>(1) Private and public water-use facilities;</P>
            <P>(2) Commercial recreation boat dock and water-use facilities;</P>
            <P>(3) Water intake structures;</P>
            <P>(4) Outfalls;</P>
            <P>(5) Mooring and loading facilities for barge terminals;</P>
            <P>(6) Minor grading and fills; and</P>
            <P>(7) Bridges and culverts for pedestrian, highway, and railroad crossings.</P>
            <P>(b) Projects resulting in flood storage loss in excess of one acre-foot will not be considered repetitive actions.</P>
            <P>(c) For projects not qualifying as repetitive actions, the applicant shall be required, as appropriate, to evaluate alternatives to the placement of fill or the construction of a project within the flood control storage zone that would result in lost flood control storage. The alternative evaluation would either identify a better option or support and document that there is no reasonable alternative to the loss of flood control storage. If this determination can be made, the applicant must then demonstrate how the loss of flood control storage will be minimized.</P>
            <P>(1) In addition, documentation shall be provided regarding:</P>
            <P>(i) The amount of anticipated flood control storage loss;</P>
            <P>(ii) The cost of compensation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from the flood control storage zone, haul it to an upland site and dispose of it);</P>
            <P>(iii) The cost of mitigation of the displaced flood control storage (how much it would cost to excavate material from another site within the flood control storage zone, haul it to the project site and use as the fill material);</P>
            <P>(iv) The cost of the project; and</P>
            <P>(v) The nature and significance of any economic and/or natural resource benefits that would be realized as a result of the project.</P>
            <P>(2) TVA may, in its discretion, decline to permit any project that would result in the loss of flood control storage.</P>

            <P>(d) Recreational vehicles parked or placed within flood control storage zones of TVA reservoirs shall be <PRTPAGE P="220"/>deemed an obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands or reservations within the meaning of section 26a of the Act unless they:</P>
            <P>(1) Remain truly mobile and ready for highway use. The unit must be on its wheels or a jacking system and be attached to its site by only quick disconnect type utilities;</P>
            <P>(2) Have no permanently attached additions, connections, foundations, porches, or similar structures; and</P>
            <P>(3) Have an electrical cutoff switch that is located above the flood control zone and fully accessible during flood events.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Uniform real property acquisition policy.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) Before negotiations are initiated for acquisition of real property, the Chief of TVA's Land Branch will cause the property to be appraised and establish an amount believed to be just compensation therefor. The appraiser shall afford the owner or his representative an opportunity to accompany him during his inspection of the property.</P>
            <P>(b) When negotiations are initiated to acquire real property, the owner will be given a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount estimated as just compensation. The statement will identify the property and the interest therein to be acquired, including buildings and other improvements to be acquired as a part of the real property, the amount of the estimated just compensation, and the basis therefor. If only a portion of the property is to be acquired, the statement will include a statement of damages and benefits, if any, to the remainder.</P>

          <P>(c) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under any program or activity subject to this part in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur, including the following activities:</P>
          <P>(1) Recruitment, advertising, and processing of applications for employment;</P>
          <P>(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, and rehiring;</P>
          <P>(3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;</P>
          <P>(4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;</P>
          <P>(5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;</P>
          <P>(6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;</P>
          <P>(7) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence to pursue training;</P>
          <P>(8) Employer sponsored activities, including those that are social or recreational; and</P>
          <P>(9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.</P>
          <P>(d) A recipient shall not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this part, including relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and with organizations providing training and apprenticeships.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Reasonable accommodation.</E> (1) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the program or activity subject to this part. Reasonable accommodation may include:</P>
          <P>(i) Making facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; and</P>
          <P>(ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, or other similar actions.</P>
          <P>(2) In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's program or activity under this paragraph factors to be considered include but are not limited to:</P>
          <P>(i) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed, and its effect, if any, on the recipient's programs or activities.</P>
          <P>(ii) The kind of operation conducted by the recipient, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and</P>
          <P>(iii) The overall size of the recipient's program or activity with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget.</P>
          <P>(3) It is not an undue hardship with respect to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the sole basis for the claim of hardship is the need to make an accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the otherwise qualified employee or applicant and the accommodation is deemed by TVA to be reasonable.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Employment criteria.</E> A recipient shall not use employment tests or criteria that discriminate against handicapped persons and shall ensure that employment tests are adapted for use by persons who have handicaps that impair sensory, manual, or speaking skills.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Preemployment inquiries.</E> (1) A recipient shall not conduct a preemployment medical examination or make a preemployment inquiry as to whether an applicant is a handicapped person or <PRTPAGE P="228"/>as to the nature or severity of a handicap except as set out in this paragraph (g).</P>
          <P>(2) A recipient may make a preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.</P>

          <P>(3) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination, taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its TVA-assisted program or activity or is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose, or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is so used, that:</P>
          <P>(i) The information requested is intended for use solely in connection with such remedial, voluntary or affirmative action efforts;</P>
          <P>(ii) The information is being requested on a voluntary basis and it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (g)(4) of this section;</P>
          <P>(iii) Refusal to provide the information will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment; and</P>
          <P>(iv) The information will be used only in accordance with this part.</P>

          <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
          <P>(i) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap; and</P>
          <P>(ii) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.</P>
          <P>(5) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of an employee or applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:</P>
          <P>(i) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary accommodations;</P>
          <P>(ii) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and</P>
          <P>(iii) TVA officials investigating compliance with section 504 shall be provided information which they deem relevant upon request.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Accessibility.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> No qualified handicapped person shall, because facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity subject to this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Existing facilities.</E> (1) Each program or activity subject to this part shall be operated so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped persons. This paragraph does not necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of an existing facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make building alterations or structural changes if other methods are effective in achieving accessibility. Such compliance methods may include (subject to the provisions of §§ 1307.4 and 1307.5), reassigning aid, benefits, or services to accessible locations within a facility; providing assistance to handicapped persons into or through an otherwise inaccessible facility; delivering programs or activities at other alternative sites which are accessible and are operated or available for use by the recipient; or other methods which comply with the intent of this paragraph.</P>

          <P>(2) This paragraph governs the timing of development of transition plans and the completion of necessary building alterations and structural changes to existing facilities, including historic property covered by paragraph (c) of this section. If building alterations or structural changes will be necessary to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the recipient shall develop a transition plan setting forth the steps <PRTPAGE P="229"/>necessary to complete the alterations or changes in accordance with such standards as TVA may specify in the contract or agreement, and shall have the plan approved by TVA. If the financial assistance from TVA is expected to last for less than three years, the contract or agreement shall specify the date by which the transition plan shall be developed and approved. If the financial assistance from TVA is expected to last for at least three years, the transition plan shall be developed and submitted to TVA within six months from the effective date of the contract or agreement, subject to extension by TVA for an additional six month period, for good cause shown to it. A transition plan shall:</P>
          <P>(i) Be developed with the assistance of interested persons or organizations representing handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(ii) Be available for public inspection after approval by TVA (or at any earlier time required by state or local law applicable to the recipient);</P>
          <P>(iii) Identify the official responsible for implementation of the approved plan; and</P>
          <P>(iv) Specify the date by which the required alterations or changes shall be completed, which shall be as soon as practicable and in no event later than three years after the effective date that financial assistance is extended by TVA.</P>
          <P>(3) Alterations to existing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Historic property.</E> If a recipient's program or activity uses an existing facility which is an historic property, the recipient shall endeavor to assure compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section by compliance methods which do not alter the historic character or architectural integrity of the historic property. The recipient must determine that accessibility cannot be accomplished by such alternative methods before considering building alterations as a compliance method. To the maximum extent possible any building alterations determined to be necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy architecturally significant elements or features. A recipient may determine that structural changes are necessary to accomplish accessibility only if the recipient has determined that accessibility cannot feasibly be accomplished by any of the other foregoing methods. To the maximum extent possible, any structural changes determined to be necessary shall be undertaken so as not to alter or destroy architecturally significant elements or features.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">New construction.</E> (1) New facilities required under a program or activity subject to this part shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>
          <P>(2) Effective as of November 4, 1988, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with Sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6 app. A) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.</P>
          <P>(3) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of physically handicapped persons.</P>
          <P>(4) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.</P>

          <P>(a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with this part and compliance with such standards for construction and alteration of facilities as TVA may provide. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing <PRTPAGE P="230"/>of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or the transferee in the case of a subsequent transfer, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient during the period for which ownership or possession of the property is retained. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreement, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.</P>
          <P>(b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired with TVA financial assistance, or in the case where financial assistance was provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a convenant running with the land assuring compliance with this part and the guidelines contained herein for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the TVA financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with of TVA financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Procedure for effecting compliance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not to be limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, (2) institution of appropriate proceedings by TVA to enforce the provisions of the agreement of financial assistance or of any deed or instrument relating thereto, and (3) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Noncompliance with § 1307.7.</E> If any entity requesting financial assistance from TVA declines to furnish the assurance required under § 1307.7, or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section; and for such purposes, the term “recipient” includes one who has been denied financial assistance. TVA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such <PRTPAGE P="232"/>paragraph except that TVA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance was due and payable pursuant to an agreement therefor entered into with TVA prior to the effective date of this part.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue financial assistance.</E> No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue financial assistance shall become effective until (1) TVA has advised the recipient of the failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, including any act of discrimination on the basis of handicap in violation of this part, and (3) the action has been approved by the TVA Board pursuant to § 1307.12. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue financial assistance shall be limited to the particular recipient as to whom such a finding had been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program or activity, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance had been so found.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Other means authorized by law.</E> No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) TVA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least ten (10) days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least ten (10) days additional efforts will be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.</P>

This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and shall either (1) fix a date not less than twenty (20) days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing and a consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the TVA Board or before a “hearing officer” who shall be either a member of the TVA Board or, at the discretion of the Board, a person designated by the Board who shall not be employed in or under the TVA division through or under which the financial assistance has been extended by TVA to the recipient involved in the hearing.</P>

          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, <PRTPAGE P="233"/>and other related matters. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>
          <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence will not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. That officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>

Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 1307.12.</P>

A copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient. Where the initial decision is made by a hearing officer, the recipient may file with the TVA Board exceptions to the initial decision, which shall include a statement of reasons therefor. Such exceptions shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the notice of initial decision. In the absence of exceptions, the TVA Board may on its own motion within forty-five (45) days after the initial decision serve on the recipient a notice that it will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the TVA Board shall review the initial decision and issue its own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the TVA Board.</P>

            <P>(b) A Contractor makes an election under paragraph (a) of this section by giving written notice to the Contracting Officer stating that the Contractor elects to proceed with the dispute under the Act. For disputes pending on March 1, 1979, the notice shall be actually received by the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's decision. For disputes initiated thereafter, the notice shall be included in the document first requesting a decision by the Contracting Officer.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Fraudulent claims.</SUBJECT>

            <P>(a) If a Contractor is unable to support any part of a claim and it is determined that such inability is attributable to the Contractor's misrepresentation of fact or fraud, the Contractor shall be liable to TVA, as set out in section 5 of the Act, for:<PRTPAGE P="237"/>
            </P>
            <P>(1) An amount equal to the unsupported part of the claim; plus</P>
            <P>(2) All TVA's costs attributable to reviewing that part of the claim.</P>
            <P>(b) The term “misrepresentation of fact” has the meaning given it in section 2(7) of the Act.</P>
            <P>(c) Prior to TVA's filing suit for amounts due under this section, TVA shall provide the Contractor with a copy of any opinion under § 1308.16 or § 1308.37(b), and shall request the Contractor to pay voluntarily the amount TVA asserts is due to it.</P>
            <P>(d) A determination by TVA that fraud or misrepresentation of the fact has been committed is not subject to decision under a disputes clause.</P>
            <P>(e) The provisions of this section are in addition to whatever penalties or remedies may otherwise be provided by law.</P>

            <P>(b) The Contracting Officer shall issue a decision to the Contractor on a submitted claim in conformity with the contract's disputes clause. Specific findings of fact are not required, but may be made. Such findings are not binding in any subsequent proceeding except as provided in § 1308.15. The decision shall:</P>

            <P>(b) The Contracting Officer shall issue a decision within any time limits set by an order under § 1308.24.

            <P>(c) As used in this subpart, the reasonableness of a time period depends on the amount or kind of relief involved and complexity of the issues raised, the adequacy of the Contractor's supporting data, contractual requirements for auditing of Contractor's cost or other data, and other relevant factors.</P>

The Hearing Officer may order at any time, with or without a motion by a party, that an appeal or counterclaim, or any part thereof, be dismissed because the matter has been settled, because the party no longer desires to pursue the matter, or because of the party's failure to prosecute the matter or to comply with the regulations in this part or with any order of the Hearing Officer. Any dismissal under this paragraph operates as an adjudication on the merits of the matter which is dismissed, and is a decision within the meaning of § 1308.23, but does not affect the Hearing Officer's jurisdiction over any matter not so dismissed.</P>

            <P>(a) TVA shall arrange for the verbatim reporting of evidentiary hearings before the Hearing Officer, and shall provide the Hearing Officer with the original transcript. The parties shall make their own arrangements with the reporter for copies.</P>

            <P>(b) Admissibility of evidence shall generally be governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence, subject, however, to the Hearing Officer's discretion. As used in those Rules, the term <E T="03">court</E> shall be deemed to mean “Hearing Officer.”</P>

            <P>(c)(1) Conduct of hearings shall generally be governed by Rules 42-44, 44.1, and 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the Hearing Officer may modify those Rules to meet the needs of the parties in a particular case. The terms <E T="03">court, plaintiff, defendant,</E> and <E T="03">action</E> as used in those Rules shall be deemed to have the meaning given them in § 1308.32.</P>
            <P>(2) After the Contractor has completed the presentation of his evidence, TVA, without waiving the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the Contractor has shown no right to relief. The Hearing Officer as the trier of the facts may then determine them and render a decision against the Contractor, or take the matter under advisement, or decline to render any decision until the close of all the evidence. Any decision rendered under this paragraph shall conform to § 1308.37, and is a decision within the meaning of § 1308.23.</P>

            <P>(d) The Hearing Officer's decision under this section will be short and may contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions of law.

An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:</P>
          <P>(a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and</P>

          <SECTNO>§ 1309.9</SECTNO>
          <SUBJECT>How does TVA provide financial assistance in conformity with the Act?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) TVA contributes financial assistance only under agreements which contain a provision which specifically requires compliance with the Act and this part. If the financial assistance involves the furnishing of real property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient, or the transferee in the case of a subsequent transfer, for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where the financial assistance involves the furnishing of personal property, the agreement shall obligate the recipient during the period for which ownership or possession of the property is retained. In all other cases the agreement shall obligate the recipient for the period during which financial assistance is extended pursuant to the agreement. TVA shall specify the form of the foregoing agreement, and the extent to which an agreement shall be applicable to subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants.</P>
          <P>(b) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired through a program of TVA financial assistance, or in the case where TVA financial assistance was provided in the form of a transfer by TVA of real property or an interest therein, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring compliance with this part and the guidelines contained herein for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the TVA financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with TVA financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained by transfer from TVA, the covenant against discrimination may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by TVA to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of TVA, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the nature of (1) the statute under which the real property is obtained, (2) the recipient, and (3) the instrument effecting or recording the transfer of title. In such event, if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, TVA may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as it deems appropriate, to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.</P>

          <SUBJECT>What general responsibilities do recipients and TVA have to ensure compliance with the Act?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A recipient has primary responsibility to ensure that its programs or activities are in compliance with the Act and shall take steps to eliminate violations of the Act. A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and afford TVA access to its records to the extent required by TVA to determine whether the recipient is in compliance with the Act.</P>
          <P>(b) TVA has responsibility to attempt to secure a recipient's compliance with the Act by voluntary means, to the fullest extent practicable, and to provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily. TVA may use the services of appropriate Federal, State, local, or private organizations for this purpose. TVA also has the responsibility to enforce the Act when a recipient fails to eliminate violations of the Act.</P>

In the case in which a primary recipient passes through financial assistance from TVA to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Access to sources of information.</E> Each recipient shall permit access by TVA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person, and such agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Information to beneficiaries and participants.</E> Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program or activity for which the recipient receives financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner as TVA finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.</P>

          <P>No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right secured by the Act or this part, or because such individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, mediation, hearing, or other proceeding under this part.

          <SUBJECT>How will complaints against recipients be processed?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Receipt of complaints.</E> Any individual who claims (individually or on behalf of any specific class of individuals) that he or she has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part (including § 1309.13) may file a written complaint with TVA. The written complaint must be filed not later than 90 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by TVA for good cause shown. A complaint shall be signed by the complainant, give the name and mailing address of the complainant and the recipient, identify the TVA financial assistance involved, and state the facts and occurrences (including dates) which led the complainant to believe that an act of prohibited discrimination has occurred. Anonymous complaints will not be accepted or filed under this section, but may be the basis for a compliance review. TVA will reject any complaint which does not <PRTPAGE P="248"/>fall within the coverage of the Act and this part, and may reject or require supplementation or clarification of any complaint which does not contain sufficient information for further processing as set forth in this paragraph. A complaint shall not be deemed filed until all such information has been provided to TVA.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Prompt resolution of complaints.</E> The complaint shall be resolved promptly. To this end, TVA shall proceed with the complaint without undue delay so that the complaint is resolved within 180 calendar days after it is filed with TVA. The recipient and complainant involved in each complaint are required to cooperate in this effort. Failure to cooperate on the part of the complainant may result in cancellation of the complaint, while such failure on the part of the recipient may result in enforcement action as described in § 1309.15.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Mediation of complaints.</E> All complaints which fall within the coverage of the Act and this part will be referred to a mediation agency designated by the Secretary.</P>
          <P>(1) The participation of the recipient and the complainant in the mediation process is required, although both parties need not meet with the mediator at the same time.</P>
          <P>(2) If the complainant and recipient reach a mutually satisfactory resolution of the complaint during the mediation period, they shall reduce the agreement to writing. The mediator shall send a copy of the settlement to TVA. No further action shall be taken based on that complaint unless it appears that the complainant or the recipient is failing to comply with the agreement.</P>
          <P>(3) Not more than 60 days after the complaint is filed, the mediator shall return a still unresolved complaint to TVA for initial investigation. The mediator may return a complaint at any time before the end of the 60-day period if it appears that the complaint cannot be resolved through mediation.</P>
          <P>(4) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the agency appointing the mediator.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Investigation.</E> (1) TVA will make a prompt investigation whenever a complaint is unresolved within 60 days after it is filed with TVA or is reopened because of a violation of the mediation agreement. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with the Act and this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with the Act and this part.</P>
          <P>(2) As part of the initial investigation, TVA shall use informal fact finding methods including joint or individual discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts, and, if possible, to resolve the complaint to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. TVA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.</P>
          <P>(3) If TVA cannot resolve the matter within 10 calendar days after the mediator returns the complaint, it shall complete the investigation, attempt to achieve voluntary compliance satisfactory to TVA, if the investigation indicates a violation, and arrange for enforcement as described in § 1309.15, if necessary.</P>

          <P>(a) If a compliance report, self-evaluation, or preaward review indicates a violation or threatened violation of the Act or this part, TVA shall attempt to secure the recipient's voluntary compliance with the Act and this part. If the violation or threatened violation cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with the Act and this part may be effected by the following means:</P>

          <P>(1) Termination of a recipient's financial assistance under the program or activity involved where the recipient has violated the Act or this part. The determination of the recipient's <PRTPAGE P="249"/>violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an appropriate hearing officer.</P>
          <P>(2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:</P>
          <P>(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or this part.</P>
          <P>(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency which will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or this part.</P>
          <P>(iii) Commencement by TVA of proceedings to enforce any rights of TVA or obligations of the recipient created by the contract, the Act, or this part.</P>
          <P>(b) Any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be limited to the particular recipient and the particular program or activity (or portion thereof) receiving financial assistance from TVA which is found to be in violation of the Act or this part. No termination shall be based in whole or in part on a finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive financial assistance from TVA.</P>
          <P>(c) No assistance will be terminated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section until:</P>
          <P>(1) TVA has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act or this part and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</P>
          <P>(2) Thirty days have elapsed after TVA has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the termination of assistance to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. A report shall be filed in each case in which TVA has determined that assistance will be terminated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
          <P>(d) TVA may defer granting new financial assistance to a recipient when termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are initiated.</P>
          <P>(1) New financial assistance includes all assistance administrated by or through TVA for which an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, is required during the deferral period.

          <SUBJECT>What is the procedure for hearings and issuance of TVA decisions required by this part?</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">Opportunity for hearing.</E> Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1309.15(a)(1), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected recipient. This notice shall advise the recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the recipient may request of TVA that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place <PRTPAGE P="250"/>so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. A recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient to request a hearing under this subsection or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under the Act and § 1309.15(a)(1) and a consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Time and place of hearing.</E> Hearings shall be held at the time and place fixed by TVA unless it determines that the convenience of the recipient requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing officer who shall be designated by TVA's General Manager, and who shall not be a TVA employee.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Right to counsel.</E> In all proceedings under this section, the recipient and TVA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Procedures, evidence, and record.</E> (1) The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof by TVA's Board of Directors shall be conducted in conformity with this part and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters, as prescribed by the hearing officer. Both TVA and the recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the hearing officer at the outset of or during the hearing.</P>
          <P>(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or received for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Consolidated or joint hearings.</E> In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, of other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under the Act, the TVA Board may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of the rules of procedure applicable to such hearings by such other departments or agencies. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
          <P>(f) <E T="03">Decisions.</E> (1) After the hearing, or after the hearing is waived under paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing officer shall make an initial decision. The recipient may file exceptions to the decision with the TVA Board within 10 days of receipt of the decision. If exceptions are not filed within the specified time, the hearing officer's initial decision becomes the final TVA decision.</P>
          <P>(2) Based on the hearing record, investigation, and any written submission to the hearing officer or the TVA Board, the Board shall render its decision accepting the initial decision, or rejecting it, in whole or part.</P>

          <P>(3) The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and <PRTPAGE P="251"/>this part, including provisions designed to assure that no financial assistance to which this regulations applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies TVA that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(g) <E T="03">Posttermination proceedings.</E> (1) A recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive financial assistance from TVA if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.</P>
          <P>(2) Any recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request TVA to restore fully its eligibility to receive financial assistance from TVA. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If TVA determines that those requirements have been satisfied, it shall restore such eligibility.</P>
          <P>(3) If TVA denies any such request, the recipient may submit a written request for a hearing, specifying why it believes TVA to have been in error. The recipient shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by TVA. The recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f)(3) of this section shall remain in effect.</P>

          <P>(a) <E T="03">Range of charges.</E> Except as otherwise provided herein, the responsible land manager shall assess a charge which he/she determines in his/her sole judgment to be approximately equal to the administrative costs incurred by TVA for each action including both the direct cost to TVA and applicable overheads. In determining the amount of such charge, the responsible land manager may establish a standard charge for each category of action rather than determining the actual administrative costs for each individual action. The standard charge shall be an amount approximately equal to TVA's actual average administrative costs for the category of action. Charges shall be not less than the minimum or greater than the maximum amount specified herein, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
          <P>(1) Land transfers—$500-$10,000.</P>

          <P>(9) Legal review; and</P>
          <P>(10) Administrative overheads associated with the transaction.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Assessment of charge when actual administrative costs significantly exceed established range.</E> When the responsible land manager determines that the actual administrative costs are expected to significantly exceed the range of costs established in paragraph (a) of this section, such manager shall not proceed with the TVA action until agreement is reached on payment of a charge calculated to cover TVA's actual administrative costs.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Quota deer hunt and turkey hunt application fees.</E> A fee for each person in the amount prescribed by the responsible land manager must accompany the complete application form for a quota deer hunt and turkey hunt permit.

No refunds will be made to unsuccessful applicants, except that fees received after the application due date will be refunded.</P>
          <P>(e) <E T="03">Additional charges.</E> In addition to the charges assessed under these regulations, TVA may impose a charge in connection with environmental reviews or other environmental investigations it conducts under its policies or procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>

          <SUBJECT>Purpose.</SUBJECT>

          <P>(a) The regulations in this part implement provisions of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm) by establishing the uniform definitions, standards, and procedures to be followed by all Federal land managers in providing protection for archaeological resources, located on public lands and Indian lands of the United States. These regulations enable Federal land managers to protect archaeological resources, taking into consideration provisions of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (92 Stat. 469; 42 U.S.C. 1996), through permits authorizing excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, through civil penalties for unauthorized excavation and/or removal, through provisions for the preservation of archaeological resource collections and data, and through provisions for ensuring confidentiality of information about archaeological resources when disclosure would threaten the archaeological resources. The regulations in this part also enable TVA's law enforcement <PRTPAGE P="257"/>agents to issue petty offense citations for violations of any provision of 16 U.S.C. 470ee or 16 U.S.C. 433.</P>
          <P>(b) The regulations in this part do not impose any new restrictions on activities permitted under other laws, authorities, and regulations relating to mining, mineral leasing, reclamation, and other multiple uses of the public lands.</P>

          <P>(a) The regulations in this part are promulgated pursuant to section 10(a) of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470ii), which requires that the Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture and Defense and the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority jointly develop uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Act.</P>
          <P>(b) In addition to the regulations in this part, section 10(b) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 470ii) provides that each Federal land manager shall promulgate such rules and regulations, consistent with the uniform rules and regulations in this part, as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Act.</P>
          <P>(c) Provisions pertaining to the issuance of petty offense citations are based on the duties and powers assigned to TVA's law enforcement agents under 16 U.S.C. 831-831ee.</P>

          <P>(a) Any person proposing to excavate and/or remove archaeological resources from public lands or Indian lands, and to carry out activities associated with such excavation and/or removal, shall apply to the Federal land manager for a permit for the proposed work, and shall not begin the proposed work until a permit has been issued. The Federal land manager may issue a permit to any qualified person, subject to appropriate terms and conditions, provided that the person applying for a permit meets conditions in § 1312.8(a) of this part.</P>

          <P>(1) No permit shall be required under this part for any person conducting activities on the public lands under other permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use, when those activities are exclusively for purposes other than the excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources, even though those activities might incidentally result in the disturbance of archaeological resources. General earth-moving excavation conducted under a permit or other authorization shall not be construed to mean excavation and/or removal as used in this part. This exception does not, however, affect the Federal land manager's responsibility to comply with other authorities which protect archaeological resources prior to approving permits, leases, licenses, or entitlements for use; any excavation and/or removal of archaeological resources required for compliance with those authorities shall be conducted in accordance with the permit requirements of this part.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Notification to Indian tribes of possible harm to, or destruction of, sites on public lands having religious or cultural importance.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) If the issuance of a permit under this part may result in harm to, or destruction of, any Indian tribal religious or cultural site on public lands, as determined by the Federal land manager, at least 30 days before issuing such a permit the Federal land manager shall notify any Indian tribe which may consider the site as having religious or cultural importance. Such notice shall not be deemed a disclosure to the public for purposes of section 9 of the Act.</P>
          <P>(1) Notice by the Federal land manager to any Indian tribe shall be sent to the chief executive officer or other designated official of the tribe. Indian tribes are encouraged to designate a tribal official to be the focal point for any notification and discussion between the tribe and the Federal land manager.</P>
          <P>(2) The Federal land manager may provide notice to any other Native American group that is known by the Federal land manager to consider sites potentially affected as being of religious or cultural importance.</P>
          <P>(3) Upon request during the 30-day period, the Federal land manager may meet with official representatives of any Indian tribe or group to discuss their interests, including ways to avoid or mitigate potential harm or destruction such as excluding sites from the permit area. Any mitigation measures which are adopted shall be incorporated into the terms and conditions of the permit under § 1312.9.</P>
          <P>(4) When the Federal land manager determines that a permit applied for under this part must be issued immediately because of an imminent threat of loss or destruction of an archaeological resource, the Federal land manager shall so notify the appropriate tribe.</P>

          <P>(b)(1) In order to identify sites of religious or cultural importance, the Federal land manager shall seek to identify all Indian tribes having aboriginal <PRTPAGE P="262"/>or historic ties to the lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction and seek to determine, from the chief executive officer or other designated official of any such tribe, the location and nature of specific sites of religious or cultural importance so that such information may be on file for land management purposes. Information on sites eligible for or included in the National Register of Historic Places may be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to section 304 of the Act of October 15, 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470w-3).</P>
          <P>(2) If the Federal land manager becomes aware of a Native American group that is not an Indian tribe as defined in this part but has aboriginal or historic ties to public lands under the Federal land manager's jurisdiction, the Federal land manager may seek to communicate with official representatives of that group to obtain information on sites they may consider to be of religious or cultural importance.</P>
          <P>(3) The Federal land manager may enter into agreement with any Indian tribe or other Native American group for determining locations for which such tribe or group wishes to receive notice under this section.</P>
          <P>(4) The Federal land manager should also seek to determine, in consultation with official representatives of Indian tribes or other Native American groups, what circumstances should be the subject of special notification to the tribe or group after a permit has been issued. Circumstances calling for notification might include the discovery of human remains. When circumstances for special notification have been determined by the Federal land manager, the Federal land manager will include a requirement in the terms and conditions of permits, under § 1312.9(c), for permittees to notify the Federal land manger immediately upon the occurrence of such circumstances. Following the permittee's notification, the Federal land manager will notify and consult with the tribe or group as appropriate. In cases involving Native American human remains and other “cultural items”, as defined by NAGPRA, the Federal land manager is referred to NAGPRA and its implementing regulations.</P>

        <SECTION>

          <SUBJECT>Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—</P>
          <P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or</P>
          <P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1313.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>
          <P>(b) <E T="03">Methods</E>—(1) <E T="03">General.</E> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of the services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling <PRTPAGE P="274"/>stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.</P>
          <P>(2) <E T="03">Historic preservation programs.</E> In meeting the requirements of § 1313.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1313.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—</P>
          <P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;</P>
          <P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or</P>
          <P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.</P>
          <P>(c) <E T="03">Time period for compliance.</E> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.</P>
          <P>(d) <E T="03">Transition plan.</E> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—</P>
          <P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;</P>
          <P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;</P>
          <P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and</P>
          <P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.</P>

          <P>(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.</P>
          <P>(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.</P>
          <P>(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.</P>

          <P>(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for <PRTPAGE P="275"/>personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.</P>
          <P>(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.</P>
          <P>(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.</P>
          <P>(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.</P>
          <P>(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1313.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.</P>

          <P>(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), or section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 792), is not readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.</P>

          <P>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following rights and obligations are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part 1314, the Securities Documentation (but not including any choice of law provisions in such documentation), and Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:</P>
          <P>(1) The rights and obligations of TVA and Reserve Banks with respect to:</P>
          <P>(i) A Book-entry TVA Power Security or Security Entitlement; and</P>

          <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1314.5(c) is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Security Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Reserve Bank pursuant to § 1314.5(c), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
          <P>(c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8, then the law specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.</P>
          <P>(d) To the extent not otherwise inconsistent with this part 1314, and notwithstanding any provision in the Securities Documentation setting forth a choice of law, the provisions set forth in 31 CFR 357.11 regarding law governing other interests apply and should be read as though modified to effectuate the application of 31 CFR 357.11 to Book-entry TVA Power Securities.</P>

          <SUBJECT>Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.</SUBJECT>
          <P>(a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry TVA Power Security has been credited to a Participant's Security Account.</P>

          <P>(b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Reserve Bank, is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United <PRTPAGE P="279"/>States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Reserve Bank, such Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Reserve Bank is a party governing the security interest.</P>
          <P>(c) TVA and Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Reserve Bank or in a Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Reserve Bank or a Person may be created and perfected by a Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a security interest in favor of the United States, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.</P>
          <P>(d) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 1314.4(b) or (d). The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection, and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.</P>

          <P>(a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 1314.5(c), for the purposes of this part 1314, TVA and Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose securities account an interest in a Book-entry TVA Power Security has been credited as the Person exclusively entitled to issue a transfer message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof, and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither TVA nor the Reserve Banks are liable to a Person asserting or having an adverse claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry TVA Power Security in a Participant's Security Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry TVA Power Security by a Reserve Bank pursuant to a transfer message that the Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.</P>
          <P>(b) The obligation of TVA to make payments with respect to Book-entry TVA Power Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:</P>
          <P>(1) Interest or other payments on Book-entry TVA Power Securities are either credited by a Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.</P>

          <P>(2) Book-entry TVA Power Securities are redeemed in accordance with their terms by a Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Security Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest, where applicable, to a Funds Account at such bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest as directed by <PRTPAGE P="280"/>the Participant. No action by the Participant ordinarily is required in connection with the redemption of a Book-entry TVA Power Security.</P>

The regulations in this part do not purport to establish whether a Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.</P>

            <P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 1315.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</P>

            <P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of <PRTPAGE P="285"/>his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</P>

            <P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.</P>
            <P>(e) First offenders under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $12,000, absent aggravating circumstances.

The Secretary of Labor has determined that “discrimination” means discharge or any other adverse actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment; the term “protected activities” includes, among other things, employees raising nuclear safety or quality controls complaints either internally to their employer or to the NRC. Contractor shall aggressively pursue any employee allegation of discrimination and shall fully investigate such allegations. Contractor shall notify the TVA Concerns Resolution Staff Site Representative of such allegation or complaint in writing, together with a copy of any complaint. Contractor shall provide TVA any investigative reports that it may prepare and shall also provide to TVA a full written description of any management action taken in response to any such allegation or complaint.

              <P>(b) Contractor shall ensure that no agreement affecting compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including, but not limited to, any agreement to settle a complaint filed by an employee or former employee of the Contractor with the Department of Labor pursuant to Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an employee or former employee from participating in any protected activity as described in the “Employee Protection” regulations of NRC, 10 CFR 50.7, including, but not limited to, providing information to NRC on potential violations of the NRC's regulations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.</P>

Should this system of protection be repealed or changed, TVA would undertake to maintain in effect during the period of operation of the plant, to the extent available on reasonable terms, liability protection which would not result in a material impairment of the protection afforded to Contractor and its suppliers under existing system.</P>

However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport.

A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation <PRTPAGE P="313"/>to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.</P>

            <P>It is the policy of TVA that:</P>
            <P>(a) TVA incorporates environmental considerations into its decision-making processes to the fullest extent possible. These procedures ensure that actions are viewed in a manner to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and the environment.</P>
            <P>(b) Commencing at the earliest possible point and continuing through implementation, appropriate and careful consideration of the environmental aspects of proposed actions is built into the decision-making process in order that adverse environmental effects may be avoided or minimized, consistent with the requirements of NEPA.</P>
            <P>(c) Environmental reviews under NEPA will assist decision makers in making better, more knowledgeable decisions that consider those reasonable alternatives to the proposed action that fulfill the purpose and need for the action, concisely present the environmental impacts and other information regarding the proposed action and its alternatives, are consistent with the environmental importance of the action, concentrate on truly significant environmental issues, and are practicable.</P>

            <P>The following definitions apply throughout this part. All other applicable terms should be given the same meaning as set forth in CEQ's currently effective regulations (40 CFR part 1508) unless such a reading would make the terms inconsistent with the context in which they appear.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Controversial</E> refers to scientifically supported commentary that casts substantial doubt on the agency's methodology or data, but does not mean commentary expressing mere opposition.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Floodplain</E> refers to the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining flowing inland waters and reservoirs. Floodplain generally refers to the base floodplain, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> that area subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.</P>

              <E T="03">Important farmland</E> includes prime farmland, unique farmland, and farmland of statewide importance as defined in 7 CFR part 657.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values</E> refer to such attributes as the capability of floodplains and wetlands to provide natural moderation of floodwaters, water quality maintenance, fish and wildlife habitat, plant habitat, open space, natural beauty, scientific and educational study areas, and recreation.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Official responsible for NEPA compliance</E> refers to the TVA official who manages the NEPA compliance staff and is responsible for overall review of TVA NEPA compliance.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Practicable,</E> as used in subpart G of this part, refers to the capability of an action being performed within existing constraints. The test of what is practicable depends on the situation and includes an evaluation of all pertinent factors, such as environmental impact, economic costs, statutory authority, legality, technological achievability, and engineering constraints.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Wetland</E> refers to an area inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances does or <PRTPAGE P="315"/>would support, a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction.

            <P>(a) Each office, group, or department (“entity”) within TVA is responsible for integrating environmental considerations into its planning and decision-making processes at the earliest possible time, to appropriately consider potential environmental effects, reduce the risk of delays, and minimize potential conflicts.</P>
            <P>(b) Environmental analyses should be included in or circulated with and reviewed at the same time as other planning documents. This responsibility is to be carried out in accordance with the environmental review procedures contained herein.</P>
            <P>(c) TVA's Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors are the agency's primary decision makers for programs and actions that are likely to be the most consequential from an environmental, financial, and policy standpoint. Other TVA officials and managers are responsible for and make decisions about other TVA actions.</P>

            <SUBJECT>NEPA determination.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) NEPA applies to proposed actions with potential impacts on the human environment that would result in a non-trivial change to the environmental status quo.</P>
            <P>(b) At the earliest possible time, the TVA entity proposing an action shall consult with the staff responsible for NEPA compliance and TVA legal counsel, as appropriate, to determine whether the action requires an environmental review under NEPA and, if so, the level of environmental review.</P>
            <P>(c) The level of review will be in one of the following categories: Categorical Exclusions, Environmental Assessments, and Environmental Impact Statements.</P>
            <P>(d) The NEPA compliance staff shall determine whether the action is already covered under an existing NEPA review, including a programmatic or generic review. Before such an action proceeds, the NEPA compliance staff shall evaluate and adequately document whether the new action is essentially similar to the previously analyzed action, the alternatives previously analyzed are adequate for the new action, there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns that would substantially change the analysis in the existing NEPA review, and there are effects that would result from the new action that were not addressed in the previous analysis</P>
            <P>(e) NEPA and its implementing regulations (both CEQ's and TVA's) provide an established, well-recognized process for appropriately analyzing environmental issues and involving the public.</P>
            <P>(f) TVA may choose to conduct an environmental review when NEPA does not apply.</P>

            <P>(d) The actions listed in appendix A of this part are classes of actions that TVA has determined do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (categorical exclusions), subject to review for extraordinary circumstances.<PRTPAGE P="316"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) The use of a categorical exclusion for an action does not relieve TVA from compliance with other statutes or consultations, including, for example, the Endangered Species Act or the National Historic Preservation Act.</P>

            <P>(a) An action that would normally qualify as a categorical exclusion must not be so classified if an extraordinary circumstance is present and cannot be mitigated, including through the application of other environmental regulatory processes. In order to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist, TVA shall consider whether:</P>
            <P>(1) The action has the potential to significantly impact environmental resources, including the following resources:</P>
            <P>(i) Species listed or proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act, or the proposed or designated Critical Habitat for these species,</P>
            <P>(ii) Wetlands or floodplains,</P>
            <P>(iii) Cultural or historical resources,</P>
            <P>(iv) Areas having special designation or recognition such as wild and scenic rivers, parklands, or wilderness areas, and</P>
            <P>(v) Important farmland; and</P>
            <P>(2) The significance of the environmental impacts associated with the proposed action is or may be highly controversial.</P>
            <P>(b) The mere presence of one or more of the resources under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not by itself preclude use of a categorical exclusion. Rather, the determination that extraordinary circumstances are present depends upon the finding of a causal relationship between a proposed action and the potential effect on these resource conditions, and, if such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect of a proposed action on these resource conditions.</P>

            <P>(5) Any major action whose environmental impacts are expected to be highly controversial.</P>
            <P>(b) If TVA determines that an EIS will not be prepared for an action falling within one of these categories, the basis for the decision must be discussed in the environmental assessment or in a document that is made available to the public.</P>
            <P>(c) An EIS shall describe the proposed action and reasonable alternatives, including no action; analyze the potential environmental impacts associated with the proposed action, alternatives, and identify any mitigation measures; and include a list of the major preparers of the EIS.</P>
            <P>(d) The scope and detail of the EIS shall be reasonably related to the scope and the probable environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternative actions (see 40 CFR 1502.10 through 1502.18).</P>
            <P>(e) The no-action alternative in an EIS (or an EA) should represent the environmental status quo and should be formulated to provide the environmental baseline from which the proposed action and other alternatives can be assessed even when TVA is legally required to take action. For proposed changes to existing programs or plans, continuation of the existing program or plan and associated environmental impacts should be considered the no-action alternative.</P>

This notice will briefly describe the proposed action, possible alternatives, and potentially affected environmental resources. In addition, the notice will identify issues that TVA has tentatively determined to be insignificant and which will not be discussed in detail in the EIS. The scoping process will be described and, if a scoping meeting will be held, the notice should state where and when the meeting is to occur if that has been determined. The notice will identify the person in TVA who can supply additional information about the action and describe how to submit comments.</P>

            <P>(e) There will be a minimum public comment period of 30 days from the date of publication of the notice of intent in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> to allow other interested agencies and the public an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed scope of the EIS.</P>

            <P>(a) Based on information obtained and decisions made during the scoping process, the NEPA compliance staff, in cooperation with the initiating TVA entity and other interested TVA entities, will prepare the preliminary DEIS using an appropriate format (see 40 CFR 1502.10).<PRTPAGE P="323"/>
            </P>
            <P>(b) During preparation of the DEIS, the NEPA compliance staff will involve any cooperating agencies to obtain their input. If a cooperating agency's analysis of an environmental issue or impact differs from TVA's, those differences should be resolved before the DEIS is released for public comment or the cooperating agency's position should be set forth and addressed in the DEIS.</P>

            <P>(c) After approval of the DEIS by the official responsible for NEPA compliance, the senior manager of the initiating TVA entity, and TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make the DEIS available to the public; other interested Federal, State, and local agencies; and other entities and individuals who have expressed an interest in the type of action or commented on the scope of the EIS. The NEPA compliance staff will then file the DEIS with EPA for publication of its notice of availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>
            <P>(d) TVA will make the DEIS available on its public website and provide it by other means upon request.</P>

            <P>(e) A minimum of 45 days from the date of publication of the notice of availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> must be provided for public comment. TVA may extend the public comment period in its discretion.</P>

            <P>(b) If changes to the DEIS in response to comments are minor and confined to factual corrections or explanations of why the comments do not warrant additional TVA response, TVA may issue errata sheets instead of rewriting the DEIS. In such cases, only the comments, the responses (including explanations why the comments do not warrant changes to the DEIS), and the changes need be circulated. The entire document with a new cover sheet shall be filed as the FEIS (40 CFR 1506.9). If other more extensive changes are required, the NEPA compliance staff, in cooperation with other interested TVA entities, will prepare an FEIS utilizing an appropriate format (see 40 CFR 1502.10).</P>
            <P>(c) The FEIS should address all substantive comments on the DEIS that TVA receives before the close of the public comment period by responding specifically to the comments and/or by revising the text of the DEIS. Comments that are substantively similar should be summarized and addressed together.</P>

            <P>(d) After approval of the FEIS by the official responsible for NEPA compliance, the senior manager of the initiating TVA entity, and TVA legal counsel, the NEPA compliance staff will make the FEIS available to the public; other interested Federal, State, and local agencies; and other entities and individuals who have expressed an interest in the type of action or commented on the DEIS. The NEPA compliance staff will then file the FEIS with EPA for publication of its notice of availability in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.</P>

            <P>(a) TVA may adopt another agency's EIS, or a portion thereof, provided that the NEPA compliance staff determines that the EIS or portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate EIS.</P>
            <P>(b) If the NEPA compliance staff determines that the actions covered by the other agency's EIS and TVA's proposed action are substantially the same, TVA may adopt the other agency's EIS as TVA's FEIS (§ 1318.404). In making this determination, the NEPA compliance staff, in consultation with other interested TVA entities, will consider whether the scope and analyses in the other agency's EIS adequately address the TVA action. TVA will also review to ensure the scientific accuracy of the analysis and conclusions drawn. TVA must make this determination and the adopted EIS available on its public website.</P>
            <P>(c) If the NEPA compliance staff determines that the actions covered by the other agency's EIS and TVA's proposed action are not substantially the same, TVA will supplement the other agency's EIS and treat it as TVA's DEIS, including circulating it for comment (§ 1318.403).</P>

            <P>(d) If TVA cooperated in the preparation of an EIS that TVA determines adequately addresses its proposed action, TVA may make a decision about its proposed action no sooner than 30 days after notice of availability of the FEIS was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A record of that decision should be prepared consistent with § 1318.405.</P>

            <P>(e) If TVA did not cooperate in the preparation of an EIS that TVA determines adequately addresses its proposed action and that it proposes to adopt, NEPA compliance staff will transmit notice of its adoption to EPA for publication of a notice of availability and circulate the FEIS for public comment as to its assessment of impacts as they relate to TVA's proposed action. TVA may make a decision about its proposed action no sooner than 30 days after notice of availability of the FEIS is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> A record of decision will be prepared consistent with § 1318.405.</P>
            <P>(f) TVA will provide notice of its adoption to other interested Federal, State, and local agencies, other entities, and individuals.</P>

That staff must determine, in consultation with TVA legal counsel, whether NEPA is triggered and the scope of the review of TVA's proposed action.</P>
            <P>(b) TVA compliance staff will provide the private entity information on its responsibilities for assisting TVA in conducting the necessary NEPA review. At TVA's discretion, this can include providing TVA detailed information about the scope and nature of the proposed action, environmental analyses and studies, and copies of associated environmental permit applications submitted to other Federal, State, or local agencies.</P>

            <P>(b) Further floodplain or wetland evaluation is unnecessary if the TVA staff determines that the proposed action:</P>
            <P>(1) Is outside the floodplain or wetland,</P>

Upon concurrence by the NEPA compliance staff in consultation with TVA legal counsel and TVA staff with expertise in floodplain or wetland impact evaluations, this determination shall be final. If a determination of no practicable alternative is made, all practicable measures to minimize impacts of the proposed action on the floodplain or wetland must be implemented. If at any time prior to commencement of the action it is determined that there is a practicable alternative that will avoid affecting floodplains or wetlands, the proposed action must not proceed.</P>
