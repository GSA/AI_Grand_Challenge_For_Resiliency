      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <P>(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that, in order to assure that anthelmintic drugs, including animal feeds bearing or containing such drugs, which do not carry the prescription statement are labeled to provide adequate directions for their effective use, labeling of these anthelmintic drugs shall bear, in addition to other required information, a statement that a veterinarian should be consulted for <PRTPAGE P="6"/>assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.</P>
              <P>(b) The label and any labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish directions for use, shall bear conspicuously the following statement: “Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.”</P>
              <P>(c) For drugs covered by approved new animal drug applications, the labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into effect without prior approval, as provided for in § 514.8(c)(3) of this chapter. For drugs listed in the index, the labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into effect without prior granting of a request for a modification, as provided for in § 516.161(b)(1) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(d) Labeling revisions required for compliance with this section shall be placed into effect by February 25, 1975, following which, any such drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce and not in compliance with this section will be subject to regulatory proceedings.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Timed-release dosage form drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Drugs are being offered in dosage forms that are designed to release the active ingredients over a prolonged period of time. There is a possibility of unsafe overdosage or ineffective dosage if such products are improperly made and the active ingredients are released at one time, over too short or too long a period of time, or not released at all. Drugs marketed in this form, which are referred to by such terms as timed-release, controlled-release, prolonged-release, sustained-release, or delayed-release drugs, are regarded as new animal drugs within the meaning of section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(b) Timed-release dosage form animal drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce are deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the act and subject to regulatory action, unless such animal drug is the subject of an approved new animal drug application, or listed in the index, as required by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) The fact that the labeling of this kind of drug may claim delayed, prolonged, controlled, or sustained-release of all or only some of the active ingredients does not affect the new animal drug status of such articles. A new animal drug application or index listing is required in any such case.</P>
              <P>(d) New animal drug applications for timed-release dosage form animal drugs must contain, among other things, data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness by establishing that the article is manufactured using procedures and controls to ensure release of the total dosage at a safe and effective rate. Data submitted in the new animal drug application must demonstrate that the formulation of the drug and the procedures used in its manufacture will ensure release of the active ingredient(s) of the drug at a safe and effective rate and that these release characteristics will be maintained until the expiration date of the drug. When the drug is intended for use in food-producing animals, data submitted must also demonstrate that, with respect to possible residues of the drug, food derived from treated animals is safe for consumption.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in cats or dogs.</P>
              <P>(1)(i) It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe enough to cause death of treated animals.</P>

              <P>(ii) The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has also <PRTPAGE P="7"/>been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic anemia is unclear.</P>
              <P>(2) The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral administration, methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and also slowly and erratically excreted in the urine. Studies in the dog indicate it is excreted in the urine essentially as leukomethylene blue stabilized in some manner. Methylene blue itself is stepwise demethylated in alkaline solutions (alkaline urine being a frequent consequence of urinary infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and Azure C. The antiseptic efficacy of all of these excretion products is unsubstantiated.</P>
              <P>(3) In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs. Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are “not new drugs” or “no longer new drugs” are hereby revoked.</P>
              <P>(b) Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application (NADA) are deemed to be adulterated under the provisions of section 501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act and subject to regulatory action as of April 10, 1978.</P>
              <P>(c) Sponsors of animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application (NADA) may submit an application in conformity with § 514.1 of this chapter. Such applications will be processed in accordance with section 512 of the act. Submission of an NADA will not constitute grounds for continued marketing of this drug substance until such application is approved.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their <PRTPAGE P="8"/>use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn cause the contamination of food intended for human consumption (meat, milk, and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that heat exchange fluids for certain pasteurization equipment used in processing animal feed contain PCB's. Although heat exchange fluids in such equipment are considered to be in <E T="03">closed systems,</E> leakage has occurred that resulted in direct contamination of animal feed with PCB's and subsequently resulted in the transfer of PCB's to human food produced by animals consuming the contaminated feed. The use of PCB-containing coatings on the inner walls of silos has resulted in the contamination of silage which has in turn caused PCB residues in the milk of dairy cows consuming the contaminated silage. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food as a result of these and other incidents represent a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.</P>
              <P>(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude accidental PCB contamination of animal feed:</P>
              <P>(1) Coatings or paints for use on the contact surfaces of feed storage areas may not contain PCB's or any other harmful or deleterious substances likely to contaminate feed.</P>
              <P>(2) New equipment or machinery for handling or processing feed in or around an establishment producing animal feed shall not contain PCB's.</P>
              <P>(3) On or before Sept. 4, 1973, the management of establishments producing animal feed shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment or machinery for handling and processing feed sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's, or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices, be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.</P>
              <P>(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any PCB-containing lubricants for equipment or machinery used for handling or processing animal feed.</P>
              <P>(iii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing establishment any other PCB-containing materials, whenever there is a reasonable expectation that such materials could cause animal feed to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.</P>

              <P>(iv) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement should be used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (<E T="03">a</E>) its toxicity; (<E T="03">b</E>) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; (<E T="03">c</E>) possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; (<E T="03">d</E>) and its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.</P>

              <P>(c) For the purpose of this section, the provisions do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.<PRTPAGE P="9"/>
              </P>
              <P>(d) For the purpose of this section, the term <E T="03">animal feed</E> includes all articles used for food or drink for animals other than man.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hexachlorophene in animal drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that there are no adequate data to establish that animal drugs containing hexachlorophene are safe and effective for any animal use other than in topical products for use on non-food-producing animals as part of a product preservative system at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent; that there is no information on the potential risk to humans from exposure to hexachlorophene by persons who apply animal products containing the drug at levels higher than 0.1 percent; and that there is likewise no information on human exposure to animals on which these animal drugs have been used and no information on possible residues of hexachlorophene in edible products of food-producing animals treated with new animal drugs that contain any quantity of hexachlorophene.</P>
              <P>(b) Animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for other than preservative use on non-food-producing animals at levels not exceeding 0.1 percent are considered new animal drugs and shall be the subject of new animal drug applications (NADA's).</P>
              <P>(c) Any person currently marketing animal drugs that contain hexachlorophene other than as part of a product preservative system for products used on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent shall submit a new animal drug application, supplement an existing application, or reformulate the product by September 29, 1977. Each application or supplemental application shall include adequate data to establish that the animal drug is safe and effective. If the animal drug is currently subject to an approved new animal drug application, each reformulation shall require an approved supplemental application. The interim marketing of these animal drugs may continue until the application has been approved, until it has been determined that the application is not approvable under the provisions of § 514.111 of this chapter, or until an existing approved application has been withdrawn.</P>
              <P>(d) After September 29, 1977, animal drugs that contain hexachlorophene other than for preservative use on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent that are introduced into interstate commerce shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)) unless such animal drug is the subject of a new animal drug application submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Action to withdraw approval of new animal drug applications will be initiated if supplemental new animal drug applications have not been submitted in accordance with this section.</P>
              <P>(e) New animal drug applications submitted for animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for use in or on food-producing animals shall include adequate data to assure that edible products from treated animals are safe for human consumption under the labeled conditions of use.</P>

              <P>(a) The use of terms such as <E T="03">tonic, tone, toner,</E> and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The terms <E T="03">tonic, tone, toner,</E> and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product.</P>
              <P>(b) The unqualified use of the term <E T="03">conditioner</E> and similar terms in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the act. The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The term <E T="03">conditioner</E> and similar terms may be used in labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the intended use(s) of the product. A product labeled as a “conditioner” or with a similar term can be either a food or drug depending upon the manner in which the term is qualified in the labeling to reflect the product's intended use.</P>
              <P>(c) An article so qualified as to be represented as a drug must be the subject of an approved new animal drug application unless the use of the article under the conditions set forth in its labeling is generally recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Epinephrine injection 1:1,000 in 10-milliliter containers for emergency treatment of anaphylactoid shock in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Anaphylactoid reactions in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine occur occasionally from the injection of antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines. Adequate directions for use of these antibiotics, bacterins, and vaccines can generally be written for use by the laity and thus are available to livestock producers. Epinephrine injection is effective for the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions in animals and would be of value in saving lives of animals if it were readily available at the time of administration of the causative agents. In connection with this problem the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicine, and other experts, and has concluded that adequate directions for over-the-counter sale of epinephrine injection 1:1,000 can be prepared.</P>
              <P>(b) In view of the above, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is in the public interest to make epinephrine injection 1:1,000 available for sale without a prescription provided that it is packaged in vials not exceeding 10 milliliters and its label bears, in addition to other required information, the following statements in a prominent and conspicuous manner: “For emergency use only in treating anaphylactoid shock. Usual Dosage: Cattle, horses, sheep, and swine—1 cubic centimeter per 100 pounds of body weight. Inject subcutaneously”.</P>
              <P>(c) The labeling must also bear a description of the symptoms of anaphylactoid shock including glassy eyes, increased salivation, grinding of the teeth, rapid breathing, muscular tremors, staggering gait, and collapse with death following. These symptoms may appear shortly after injection of a bacterin, vaccine, or antibiotic.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope of this subpart.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that sponsored compounds intended for use in food-producing animals be shown to be safe and that food produced from animals exposed to these compounds be shown to be safe for consumption by people. The statute prohibits the use in food-producing animals of any compound found to induce cancer when ingested by people or animals unless it can be determined by methods of examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary (a function delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs) that no residue of that compound will be found in the food produced from those animals <PRTPAGE P="12"/>under conditions of use reasonably certain to be followed in practice. This subpart identifies the steps a sponsor of a compound shall follow to secure the approval of the compound. FDA guidance documents contain the procedures and protocols FDA recommends for the implementation of this subpart. These guidance documents are available from the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Requests for these guidance documents should be identified with Docket No. 1983D-0288.</P>
              <P>(b) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment that a sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on the sponsored compound, FDA will also determine whether and to what extent the sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on metabolites of the sponsored compound. The bioassays that a sponsor conducts must be designed to assess carcinogenicity and to determine the quantitative aspects of any carcinogenic response.</P>
              <P>(c) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment or at a later time during the approval process that the data show that the sponsored compound and its metabolites should not be subject to this subpart, FDA will continue to consider the compound for approval under the general safety provisions of the act for risks other than cancer.</P>
              <P>(d) This subpart does not apply to essential nutrients.</P>

              <P>(a) On the basis of the results of the chronic bioassays and other information, FDA will determine whether any of the substances tested are carcinogenic.</P>
              <P>(b) If FDA concludes that the results of the bioassays do not establish carcinogenicity, then FDA will not subject the sponsored compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart.</P>
              <P>(c) For each sponsored compound that FDA decides should be regulated as a carcinogen, FDA will either analyze the data from the bioassays using a statistical extrapolation procedure as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or evaluate an alternate procedure proposed by the sponsor as provided in § 500.90. In either case, paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section apply.</P>

              <P>(1) For each substance tested in separate bioassays, FDA will calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 million. FDA will designate the lowest value obtained as S<E T="52">o</E>. Because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, FDA will make corrections for food intake. FDA will designate as S<E T="52">m</E> the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 in 1 million.</P>

              <P>(2) From the appropriate residue chemistry data FDA will calculate the R<E T="52">m</E> as described in § 500.86(c). The sponsor must provide a regulatory method in accordance with § 500.88(b). FDA will calculate the LOD of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under § 500.88. The LOD must be less than or equal to R<E T="52">m</E>.</P>
              <P>(3) FDA will conclude that the provisions of this subpart are satisfied when no residue of the compound is detectable (that is, the marker residue is below the LOD) using the approved regulatory method under the conditions of use of the sponsored compound, including any required preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Principal display panel of package form animal food.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The term <E T="03">principal display panel</E> as it applies to food in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term <E T="03">area of the principal display panel</E> means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:</P>
              <P>(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side;</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference;</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container: <E T="03">Provided, <PRTPAGE P="16"/>however,</E> That where such container presents an obvious <E T="03">principal display panel</E> such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Information panel of package for animal food.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">information panel</E> as it applies to packaged food means that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel with the following exceptions:</P>
              <P>(1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part of the label may be used.</P>
              <P>(2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right of any principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(b) All information required to appear on the label of any package of food pursuant to §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8 and 501.17 shall appear either on the principal display panel or on the information panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less than <FR>1/16</FR> inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications of §§ 501.15 and 501.105(h) (1) and (2).</P>

              <P>(1) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(i) The package is designed such that it has a surface area that can bear an information panel and/or an alternate principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 10 square inches.</P>
              <P>(iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than <FR>3/64</FR> inch in height.</P>

              <P>(2) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>

              <P>(i) The package is designed such that it has a single <E T="03">obvious principal display panel</E> as this term is defined in § 501.1 and has no other available surface area for an information panel or alternate principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal display panel of the package as this term is defined in § 501.1 is less than 12 square inches and bears all labeling appearing on the package.</P>
              <P>(iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the single, obvious principal display panel in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than <FR>1/32</FR> inch in height.</P>

              <P>(3) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of this paragraph: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>

              <P>(i) The package is designed such that it has a total surface area available to <PRTPAGE P="17"/>bear labeling of less than 12 square inches.</P>
              <P>(ii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in accordance with regulations in this part.</P>
              <P>(iii) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is not less than <FR>1/32</FR> inch in height.</P>
              <P>(d) All information required to appear on the principal display panel or on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, any vignettes, design, and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between these two panels except that the information required pursuant to any given section or part shall all appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the information panel.</P>
              <P>(e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without other intervening material.</P>
              <P>(f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate all of the information required by §§ 501.4, 501.5, 501.8, and 501.17, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to this paragraph shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Identity labeling of animal food in package form.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity.</P>
              <P>(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:</P>
              <P>(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,</P>
              <P>(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof,</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such food.</P>
              <P>(c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be included in the statement. This specification does not affect the required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.</P>
              <P>(d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.</P>

              <P>(e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word <E T="03">imitation</E> and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.</P>

              <P>(1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.<PRTPAGE P="18"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles.</P>
              <P>(ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the provisions of § 502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading.</P>
              <P>(3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of the act, in a common or usual name regulation and may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading, and established pursuant to part 502 of this chapter), and which complies with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not be deemed to be an imitation.</P>
              <P>(4) Nutritional inferiority includes:</P>
              <P>(i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present in a measurable amount.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate regulation governing the particular food.</P>
              <P>(f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to part 502 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, state, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including invoice).</P>

              <P>(e) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a food at a place other than his principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of <PRTPAGE P="20"/>business in lieu of the actual place where such food was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Labeling of animal food with number of servings.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The label of any package of a food which bears a representation as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example, cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to cookery and describes a constant quantity. Such statement may not be misleading in any particular. A statement of the number of units in a package is not in itself a statement of the number of servings.</P>

              <P>(b) If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10 by the Department of Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term <E T="03">serving</E> with respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such quantitative definition.

              <P>(3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the container or package available for such extension, so as to provide sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information;</P>
              <P>(4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;</P>
              <P>(5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space to give materially greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, or information, or to any design or device; or</P>
              <P>(6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic matter.</P>
              <P>(b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403(e) or (i) of the act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;</P>
              <P>(2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any word, statement, or other information that is required by section 403(f) of the act; or</P>
              <P>(3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign language.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in the case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a territory where the predominant language is one other <PRTPAGE P="21"/>than English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Animal foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings, and chemical preservatives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The term <E T="03">artificial flavor</E> or <E T="03">artificial flavoring</E> means any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in §§ 172.515(b) and 582.60 of this chapter except where these are derived from natural sources.</P>
              <P>(2) The term <E T="03">spice</E> means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, such as the following:

              <FP>Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, shall be declared as <E T="03">spice and coloring</E> unless declared by their common or usual name.</FP>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">natural flavor</E> or <E T="03">natural flavoring</E> means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) The term <E T="03">artificial color</E> or <E T="03">artificial coloring</E> means any <E T="03">color additive</E> as defined in § 70.3(f) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(5) The term <E T="03">chemical preservative</E> means any chemical that, when added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or herbicidal properties.</P>
              <P>(b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package form.</P>
              <P>(c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative shall be placed on the food, or on its container or wrapper, or on any two or all of these, as may be necessary to render such statement likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use of such food.</P>

              <P>(d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, cannot be placed on such units with <PRTPAGE P="23"/>such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.</P>
              <P>(e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(k) of the act.</P>
              <P>(f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical prior to harvest.</P>
              <P>(g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be labeled as provided in the standard:</P>
              <P>(1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared by its common or usual name.</P>
              <P>(2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may state “All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.” Any flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.</P>

              <P>(3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <E T="03">strawberry flavor, banana flavor,</E> or <E T="03">natural strawberry flavor.</E> In cases where the flavor contains both a natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <E T="03">natural and artificial strawberry flavor.</E> In cases where the flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., <E T="03">artificial strawberry flavor.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:</P>

              <P>(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as <E T="03">spice, natural flavor,</E> or <E T="03">artificial flavor,</E> or any combination thereof, as the case may be.</P>
              <P>(2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of § 501.100(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.</P>

              <P>(4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name <E T="03">salt.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name <E T="03">monosodium glutamate.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as an ingredient in a food may be declared as <E T="03">artificial flavor</E> or <E T="03">artificial smoke flavor.</E> No representation may be made, either directly or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked flavor.</P>

              <P>(i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary recognizable flavor(s), by word, <E T="03">vignette,</E> e.g., depiction of a fruit, or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food other than through <PRTPAGE P="24"/>the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the following way:</P>
              <P>(1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food, except that:</P>

              <P>(i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a characterizing food ingredient, and the food contains natural flavor derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food contains no such ingredient, the name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the word <E T="03">natural</E> and shall be immediately followed by the word <E T="03">flavored</E> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor.</P>

              <P>(ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which the flavor is derived or as <E T="03">artificially flavored.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately followed by the words <E T="03">with other natural flavor</E> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the characterizing flavor.</P>

              <P>(2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s) <E T="03">artificial</E> or <E T="03">artificially flavored,</E> in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor.</P>
              <P>(3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except:</P>
              <P>(i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such food.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor.</P>

              <P>(4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A flavor used shall be required to make such a written certification only where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need make no separate certification. <PRTPAGE P="25"/>All such certifications shall be retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the flavor is supplied and for a minimum of 3 years thereafter, and shall be subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized officer, or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying party to the penalties for making any false report to the government under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under section 303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.</P>
              <P>(iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records ready for verification as soon as practicable; provided that, whenever the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during such period.</P>
              <P>(iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be verified.</P>

              <P>(v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>

              <P>(j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, except when exempt pursuant to § 501.100, bear a label declaration stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g., <E T="03">preservative, to retard spoilage, a mold inhibitor, to help protect flavor</E> or <E T="03">to promote color retention.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(k) The label of an animal food to which any coloring has been added shall declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients in the manner specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) A color additive or the lake of a color additive subject to certification under section 721(c) of the act shall be declared by the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter, except that it is not necessary to include the “FD&amp;C” prefix or the term “No.” in the declaration, but the term <PRTPAGE P="26"/>“Lake” shall be included in the declaration of the lake of the certified color additive (e.g., Blue 1 Lake).

              <SUBJECT>Animal food; exemptions from labeling.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food is fabricated from two or more ingredients).</P>
              <P>(1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the items that make up different packages packed from such assortment normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which may be present.</P>
              <P>(2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either (i) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (ii) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the act.</P>
              <P>(3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are:</P>
              <P>(i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a functional or technical effect.</P>
              <P>(ii) Processing aids, which are as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is packaged in its finished form.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in the food.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.</P>
              <P>(iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.</P>
              <P>(b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met.</P>

              <P>(1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor).<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.</P>
              <P>(c) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the act if:</P>
              <P>(1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or</P>
              <P>(2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that such food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them.</P>
              <P>(e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions.</P>
              <P>(1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed.</P>
              <P>(2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire:</P>
              <P>(i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration of such a marker <PRTPAGE P="28"/>is granted, therefore, provided that the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and</P>
              <P>(2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.</P>

              <P>The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition pursuant to part 10 of this chapter may issue a proposal to amend § 501.4 to specify the manner in which an ingredient(s) shall be declared, i.e., by specific or class name, or § 501.100 to exempt an ingredient(s) from the requirements for label declaration.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 501.105</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.</P>
              <P>(2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 °F (4 °C).</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C).</P>
              <P>(3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions thereof.</P>
              <P>(c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such information.</P>
              <P>(d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions.</P>

              <P>(e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it <PRTPAGE P="29"/>shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.</P>

              <P>(f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (such as <E T="03">jumbo quart</E> and <E T="03">full gallon</E>) that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part.</P>
              <P>(g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith; provided that in the case of foods packed in containers designed to deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.</P>
              <P>(h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that:</P>
              <P>(1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide).</P>
              <P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards.</P>
              <P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards.</P>
              <P>(i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:</P>
              <P>(1) Not less than <FR>1/16</FR> inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.</P>
              <P>(2) Not less than <FR>1/8</FR> inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches.</P>
              <P>(3) Not less than <FR>3/16</FR> inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches.</P>

              <P>(4) Not less than <FR>1/4</FR> inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than <FR>1/2</FR> inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches.
              </P>
              <FP>Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (i) (1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by <FR>1/16</FR> of an inch.</FP>
              <P>(j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:</P>

              <P>(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, <PRTPAGE P="30"/>or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) (3) and (4) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph (m)(5) of this section).</P>

              <P>(3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term <E T="03">net weight</E> shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms <E T="03">net</E> or <E T="03">net contents</E> in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, <E T="03">Net wt. 6 oz.</E> or <E T="03">6 oz. net wt.</E> and <E T="03">6 fl. oz.</E> or <E T="03">net contents 6 fl. oz.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).</P>

              <P>(m) <E T="03">Examples:</E> (1) A declaration of 1<FR>1/2</FR> pounds weight shall be expressed as <E T="03">Net Wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.), Net Wt. 24 oz. (1<FR>1/2</FR> lb.),</E> or <E T="03">Net Wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lb.).</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) A declaration of <FR>3/4</FR> pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as <E T="03">Net Wt. 12 oz.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as <E T="03">Net 32 fl. oz. (1 qt.).</E>
              </P>

              <P>(4) A declaration of 1<FR>3/4</FR> quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as <E T="03">Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1<FR>1/2</FR> pints)</E> or as <E T="03">Net 56 fluid oz. (1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz.),</E> but not in terms of quart and ounce such as <E T="03">Net 56 fluid oz. (1 quart 24 ounces).</E>

              <P>(o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; provided, that such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, <E T="03">jumbo quart</E> and <E T="03">full gallon.</E> Dual or combination declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located on the principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels.</P>

              <P>(q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents <PRTPAGE P="31"/>of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.</P>
              <P>(r) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: <E T="03">6-16 oz. bottles—(96 fl. oz.)</E> or <E T="03">3-16 oz. cans—(net wt. 48 oz).</E> For the purposes of this section, <E T="03">multiunit retail package</E> means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units nor prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter (except the requirement that food falling below the applicable standard of fill of container shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 564.14(b) of this chapter), the mislabeled food product, including any food product that fails to bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 564.14(b) of this chapter, may be sold by the manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, State or local governments: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include acknowledgement of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, e.g., “Actual net weight may be as low as __% below labeled quantity” and that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.</P>
              <P>(2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping container with the statement(s):</P>
              <P>(i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight of volume—“Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or volume where appropriate) may be as low as __% below labeled quantity. This Product Not for Retail Distribution,” the blank to be filled in with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping container, and</P>

            <SUBJECT>General principles.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) The common or usual name of a food, which may be a coined term, shall accurately identify or describe, in as simple and direct terms as possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties or ingredients. The name shall be uniform among all identical or similar products and may not be confusingly similar to the name of any other food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name. Each class or subclass of food shall be given its own common or usual name that states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from different foods.</P>
            <P>(b) The common or usual name of a food shall include the percentage(s) of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when the proportion of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present in an amount greater than is actually the case. The following requirements shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.</P>
            <P>(1) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared on the basis of its quantity in the finished product (i.e., weight/weight in the case of solids, or volume/volume in the case of liquids).</P>

            <P>(2) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared by the words “containing (or <PRTPAGE P="33"/>contains) __ percent (or %) __” or “__ percent (or %) __” with the first blank filled in with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the actual percentage of the ingredient or component named and the second blank filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or component. The word “containing” (or “contains”), when used, shall appear on a line immediately below the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section. For each characterizing ingredient or component, the words “__ percent (or %) __”shall appear following or directly below the word “containing” (or “contains”), or directly below the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section when the word “containing” (or “contains”) is not used, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less than the larger of the following alternatives:</P>
            <P>(i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages having a principal display panel with an area of 5 square inches or less and not less than one-eighth inch in height if the area of the principal display panel is greater than 5 square inches; or</P>
            <P>(ii) Not less than one-half the height of the largest type appearing in the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
            <P>(c) The common or usual name of a food shall include a statement of the presence or absence of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) and/or the need for the user to add any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when the presence or absence of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present when it is not, and consumers may otherwise be misled about the presence or absence of the ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food. The following requirements shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.</P>
            <P>(1) The presence or absence of a characterizing ingredient or component shall be declared by the words “containing (or contains) ____” or “containing (or contains) _____” or “no _____” or “does not contain _____”, with the blank being filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or component.</P>
            <P>(2) The need for the user of a food to add any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) shall be declared by an appropriate informative statement.</P>
            <P>(3) The statement(s) required under paragraph (c) (1) and/or (2) of this section shall appear following or directly below the part of the common or usual name of the food required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less than the larger of the alternatives established under paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.</P>
            <P>(d) A common or usual name of a food may be established by common usage or by establishment of a regulation in this part, in a standard of identity, or in other regulations in this chapter.</P>

A petition requesting such a regulation, which would amend the applicable regulation, shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(i) Section 402(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been manufactured under such conditions that it is unfit for food; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in that the food has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health; and</P>
              <P>(2) In violation of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264).</P>

              <P>(b) The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under this subpart be completed within 1 calendar day, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) The order withdrawing an exemption under §§ 507.62 and 507.65, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for a hearing under this subpart must be addressed to the FDA Division Director (or, in the case of a foreign facility, the Director of the Division of Compliance in the Center for Veterinary Medicine) as provided in the order withdrawing an exemption.</P>

              <P>(4) Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer must prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. The presiding officer must include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and must include a proposed decision, with a statement of reasons. The hearing participant may review and comment on the presiding officer's report within 2 calendar days of issuance of the report. The presiding officer will then issue the final decision.</P>

              <P>(5) Section 16.80(a)(4) of this chapter does not apply to a regulatory hearing <PRTPAGE P="59"/>under this subpart.

              <P>(7) If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of an order withdrawing an exemption, the hearing must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under a regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that § 16.95(b) does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the administrative record of the hearing specified in §§ 16.80(a)(1) through (3), and (a)(5), of this chapter, and 507.73(c)(5) constitutes the exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision. For purposes of judicial review under § 10.45 of this chapter, the record of the administrative proceeding consists of the record of the hearing and the presiding officer's final decision.</P>

              <P>(b)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when a hazard in a raw material or other ingredient will be controlled by the supplier and is one for which there is a reasonable probability that exposure to the hazard will result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals:</P>
              <P>(i) The appropriate supplier verification activity is an onsite audit of the supplier; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The audit must be conducted before using the raw material or other ingredient from the supplier and at least annually thereafter.</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply if there is a written determination that other verification activities and/or less frequent onsite auditing of the supplier provide adequate assurance that the hazards are controlled.</P>
              <P>(c) If a supplier is a qualified facility as defined by § 507.3, the receiving facility does not need to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if the receiving facility:</P>

              <P>(ii) A statement that the facility is in compliance with State, local, county, tribal, or other applicable non-Federal food safety laws, including relevant laws and regulations of foreign countries.</P>
              <P>(d) If a supplier is a farm that grows produce and is not a covered farm under part 112 of this chapter in accordance with § 112.4(a), or in accordance with §§ 112.4(b) and 112.5, the receiving facility does not need to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for produce that the receiving facility receives from the farm as a raw material or other ingredient if the receiving facility:</P>

              <P>(a) An onsite audit of a supplier must be performed by a qualified auditor.</P>

              <P>(b) If the raw material or other ingredient at the supplier is subject to one or more FDA food safety regulations, an onsite audit must consider such regulations and include a review of the supplier's written plan (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan or other food safety plan), if any, and its implementation, for the hazard being controlled (or, when applicable, an onsite audit may consider relevant laws and regulations of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or has determined to be equivalent to that of the United States).</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The following may be substituted for an onsite audit, provided that the inspection was conducted within 1 year of the date that the onsite audit would have been required to be conducted:</P>
              <P>(i) The written results of an appropriate inspection of the supplier for compliance with applicable FDA food safety regulations by FDA, by representatives of other Federal Agencies (such as the United States Department of Agriculture), or by representatives of State, local, tribal, or territorial agencies; or</P>
              <P>(ii) For a foreign supplier, the written results of an inspection by FDA or the food safety authority of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or has determined to be equivalent to that of the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) For inspections conducted by the food safety authority of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent, the animal food that is the subject of the onsite audit must be within the scope of the official recognition or equivalence determination, and the foreign supplier must be in, and under the regulatory oversight of, such country.</P>
              <P>(d) If the onsite audit is solely conducted to meet the requirements of this subpart by an audit agent of a certification body that is accredited in accordance with regulations in part 1, subpart M of this chapter, the audit is not subject to the requirements in those regulations.</P>

              <P>(a) Use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a pesticide chemical, that is also a food additive will be controlled by a regulation issued under section 409 of the act when possible. When such a use cannot be approved under the criteria of section 409 of the act, or when the added poisonous or deleterious substance is not a food additive, a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level may be established pursuant to the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Residues resulting from the use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical will ordinarily be controlled by a tolerance established in a regulation issued under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When such a regulation has not been issued, an action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical may be established by the Food and Drug Administration. The Food and Drug Administration will request EPA to recommend such an action level pursuant to the criteria established in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A tolerance for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The substance cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.</P>
              <P>(2) The tolerance established is sufficient for the protection of the public health, taking into account the extent of which the presence of the substance cannot be avoided and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or related poisonous or deleterious substances.</P>
              <P>(3) No technological or other changes are foreseeable in the near future that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance established. Examples of changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance include anticipated improvements in good manufacturing practice that would change the extent to which use of the substance is unavoidable and anticipated studies expected to provide significant new toxicological or use data.</P>
              <P>(c) A regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when each of the following criteria is met:</P>
              <P>(1) The substance cannot be avoided by current good manufacturing practices.</P>
              <P>(2) There is no tolerance established for the substance in the particular food under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act.</P>
              <P>(3) There is insufficient information by which a tolerance may be established for the substance under section 406 of the act or technological changes appear reasonably possible that may affect the appropriateness of a tolerance. The regulatory limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.</P>

              <P>(d) An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are met, except that technological or other changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance are foreseeable in the near future. An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established at a level at which the Food and Drug Administration may regard the food as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, <PRTPAGE P="70"/>without regard to the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section or in section 406 of the act. An action level will be withdrawn when a tolerance or regulatory limit for the same substance and use has been established.</P>
              <P>(e) Tolerances will be established under authority appropriate for action levels (sections 306, 402(a), and 701(a) of the act, together with section 408 or 409 of the act, if appropriate) as well as under authority appropriate for tolerances (sections 406 and 701 of the act). In the event the effectiveness of a tolerance is stayed pursuant to section 701(e)(2) of the act by the filing of an objection, the order establishing the tolerance shall be deemed to be an order establishing an action level until final action is taken upon such objection.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, and plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn caused the contamination of food products intended for human consumption (meat, milk and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that a significant percentage of paper food-packaging material contains PCB's which can migrate to the packaged food. The origin of PCB's in such material is not fully understood. Reclaimed fibers containing carbonless copy paper (contains 3 to 5 percent PCB's) have been identified as a primary source of PCB's in paper products. Some virgin paper products have also been found to contain PCB's, the source of which is generally attributed to direct contamination from industrial accidents from the use of PCB-containing equipment and machinery in food-packaging manufacturing establishments. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food-packaging materials as a result of industrial accidents, which can cause the PCB contamination of food, represents a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of <PRTPAGE P="71"/>PCB's in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.</P>
              <P>(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude the accidental PCB contamination of food-packaging materials:</P>
              <P>(1) New equipment or machinery for manufacturing food-packaging materials shall not contain or use PCB's.</P>
              <P>(2) On or before September 4, 1973, the management of establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment for manufacturing food-packaging materials sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.</P>
              <P>(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the establishment any other PCB-containing equipment, machinery and materials wherever there is a reasonable expectation that such articles could cause food-packaging materials to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.</P>

              <P>(iii) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement is used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (<E T="03">a</E>) its toxicity; (<E T="03">b</E>) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; (<E T="03">c</E>) possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; and (<E T="03">d</E>) its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of this section do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Temporary tolerances for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are toxic, industrial chemicals. Because of their widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications, PCB's have become a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. As a result, certain foods and animal feeds, principally those of animal and marine origin, contain PCB's as unavoidable, environmental contaminants. PCB's are transmitted to the food portion (meat, milk, and eggs) of food producing animals ingesting PCB contaminated animal feed. In addition, a significant percentage of paper food-packaging materials contain PCB's which may migrate to the packaged food. The source of PCB's in paper food-packaging materials is primarily of certain types of carbonless copy paper (containing 3 to 5 percent PCB's) in waste paper stocks used for manufacturing recycled paper. Therefore, temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's as unavoidable environmental or industrial contaminants are established for a sufficient period of time following the effective date of this paragraph to permit the elimination of such contaminants at the earliest practicable time. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term <E T="03">polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's)</E> is applicable to mixtures of chlorinated biphenyl compounds, irrespective of which mixture of PCB's is present as the residue. The temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 0.2 part per million in finished animal feed for food-producing animals (except the following finished animal feeds: feed concentrates, feed supplements, and feed premixes).</P>

              <P>(2) 2 parts per million in animal feed components of animal origin, including fishmeal and other by-products of marine origin and in finished animal feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes intended for food-producing animals.<PRTPAGE P="72"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) 10 parts per million in paper food-packaging material intended for or used with finished animal feed and any components intended for animal feeds. The tolerance shall not apply to paper food-packaging material separated from the food therein by a functional barrier which is impermeable to migration of PCB's.</P>
              <P>(b) A compilation entitled “Analytical Methodology for Polychlorinated Biphenyls, February 1973” for determining compliance with the tolerances established in this section is available from the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.</P>

              <P>(a) Part 526 of this chapter provides for new animal drugs intended for intramammary use in animals and includes conditions of use intended to prevent the contamination of milk from the use of such drugs.</P>
              <P>(b) Preparations containing antibiotics and other potent drugs labeled with directions for use in milk-producing animals will be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the act unless their labeling bears appropriate warnings and directions for use to avoid adulteration of milk under section 402(a)(2)(c)(ii) of the act.</P>
              <P>(c) It is the position of the Food and Drug Administration that the labeling for such preparations should bear a clear warning that either:</P>
              <P>(1) The article should not be administered to animals producing milk, since to do so would result in contamination of the milk; or</P>
              <P>(2) The label should bear the following statement: “Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and for __ hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food”, the blank being filled in with the figure that the manufacturer has determined by appropriate investigation is needed to insure that the milk will not carry violative residues resulting from use of the preparation. If the use of the preparation as recommended does not result in contamination of the milk, neither of the above warning statements is required.</P>

              <P>Whenever the labeling of an antibiotic drug included in the regulations in this chapter suggests or recommends its use in milk-producing animals, the label of such drugs shall bear either the statement “Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this use will result in contamination of the milk” or the statement “Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and for __hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food”, the blank being filled in with the figure that the Commissioner has authorized the manufacturer of the drug to use. The Commissioner shall determine what such figures shall be from information submitted by the manufacturer and which the Commissioner considers is adequate to prove that period of time after the latest treatment that the milk from treated animals will contain no violative residues from use of the preparation. If the Commissioner determines from the information submitted that the use of the antibiotic drug as recommended does not result in its appearance in the milk, the Commissioner may exempt <PRTPAGE P="75"/>the drug from bearing either of the above warning statements.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Antibiotics used in food-producing animals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration in the interest of fulfilling its responsibilities with regard to protection of the public health has requested an evaluation of the public health aspects of the use of antibiotics in veterinary medical and nonmedical uses. There is particular concern with regard to the potential hazards associated with the extensive use of antibiotics administered to food-producing animals. Accordingly, an ad hoc committee on the Veterinary Medical and Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics was established by the Food and Drug Administration to study and advise the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on the uses of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to their safety and effectiveness.</P>

              <P>(b) Based upon an evaluation of the conclusions of said Committee and other relevant material, § 510.112 was published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> of August 23, 1966 (31 FR 11141), asking sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals to submit data to establish whether such antibiotic and its metabolites are present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals. The data on the residues of antibiotics in milk from intramammary infusion preparations were requested within 60 days and the data on all other products were requested within 180 days following the date of publication of § 510.112 in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(c) An evaluation of the data now available shows that use of many antibiotic preparations cause residues in edible products of treated animals for varying and, in some cases, for long periods of time following the last administration. Because of the accumulation of new information with regard to the development of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to transfer this resistance, and the development of sensitivity to antibiotics in humans, unauthorized and unsafe residues of antibiotics cannot be permitted in food obtained from treated animals.</P>
              <P>(d) Based on evaluation of information available, including the conclusions of the aforementioned ad hoc Committee, the Commissioner concludes that antibiotic preparations intended for use in food-producing animals, other than topical and ophthalmic preparations, are not generally recognized among qualified experts as having been shown to be safe for their intended use(s) within the meaning of section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(e) Therefore, all exemptions from the provisions of section 409 of the act for use of antibiotics in food-producing animals based on sanctions or approvals granted prior to enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929; 72 Stat. 1784) will be revoked and the uses which are concluded to be safe will be covered by food additive regulations. On those products for which there are inadequate residue data, actions will be initiated to withdraw approval of new-drug applications under the provisions of section 505 of the act. Antibiotic preparations, other than those for topical and ophthalmic application in food-producing animals, which are not covered by food additive regulations will be subject to regulatory action within 180 days after publication of the forthcoming revocation order.</P>
              <P>(f) Because of the variation in the period of time that antibiotic residues may remain in edible products from treated animals, all injectable, intramammary infusion, intrauterine, and oral preparations, including medicated premixes intended for use in food-producing animals, are deemed to be new drugs as well as food additives.</P>

              <P>(a) An ad hoc committee, Committee on the Veterinary Medical and Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics, was <PRTPAGE P="76"/>formed by the Food and Drug Administration to study, and advise the Commissioner on, the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety and effectiveness of such substances. A copy of the report may be obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Room 15-05, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</P>
              <P>(b) On the basis of the report of the Committee and other information, sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals shall submit data for determining whether or not such antibiotics and their metabolites are present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals; however, in the case of a drug for which such data have already been submitted and for which a regulation has been promulgated under section 409 of the act, only such data as has been accumulated since the issuance of the regulation need be submitted.</P>

              <P>(c) The required data shall be submitted within 180 days of the date of publication of this section in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>; except that in the case of data on intramammary infusion preparations the data shall be submitted within 60 days of such publication. Data demonstrating the absence in milk of residues of intramammary infusion preparations when used as directed in their labeling are needed within the 60-day period because of the importance of milk in the human diet.</P>
              <P>(d) Regulatory proceedings including revocation of prior sanctions, or actions to suspend or amend new drug or antibiotic approvals granted prior to passage of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (72 Stat. 1784), may be initiated with regard to the continued marketing of any antibiotic preparation on which the required information is not submitted within the period of time prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Questions relating to the acceptability of proposed research protocols and assay methods for determining the amount of antibiotic residues in food should be directed to the Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.</P>

              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of side effects associated with the oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use of corticosteroid animal drugs. The use of these drugs administered orally or by injection has resulted in premature parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy. Premature parturition may be followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids used in dogs, rabbits, and rodents during pregnancy have produced cleft palate in offspring. Use in dogs has resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca. Drugs subject to this section are required to carry the veterinary prescription legend and are subject to the labeling requirements of § 201.105 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(b) In view of these potentially serious side effects, the Food and Drug Administration has concluded that the labeling on or within packaged corticosteroid-containing preparations intended for animal use shall bear conspicuously the following warning statement:

            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Caution.</E> Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only in laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in humans.</P>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>(2) The person distributing or causing the distribution of new animal drugs for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research purposes under this exemption shall use due diligence to assure that the consignee is regularly engaged in conducting such tests and that the shipment of the new animal drug will actually be used for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research.</P>
            <P>(3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the name and post office address of the expert or expert organization to whom the new animal drug is shipped and the date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, he shall make such records available for inspection and copying.</P>
            <P>(4) The exemption allowed in this paragraph shall not apply to any new animal drug intended for in vitro use in the regular course of diagnosing or treating disease, including antibacterial sensitivity discs impregnated with any new animal drug or drugs, which discs are intended for use in determining susceptibility of microorganisms to the new animal drug or drugs.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">New animal drugs for clinical investigation in animals.</E> A shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or an animal feed containing a new animal drug intended for clinical investigational use in animals shall be exempt from section 512(a) and (m) of the act if all the following conditions are met:</P>
            <P>(1) The label shall bear the statements:
            </P>
            <EXTRACT>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Caution.</E> Contains a new animal drug for use only in investigational animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans. Edible products of investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</P>
            </EXTRACT>
            
            <P>In the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the caution statements required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the statements may be included on the carton label and other labeling on or within the package from which the new animal drug is to be dispensed.</P>
            <P>(2) The person or firm distributing or causing the distribution of the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug shall use due diligence to assure that the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug will actually be used for tests in animals and is not used in humans.</P>

            <P>(3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the name <PRTPAGE P="83"/>and post office address of the investigator to whom the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug is shipped and the date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, such records shall be made available for inspection and copying.</P>
            <P>(4) Prior to shipment of the new animal drug for clinical tests in animals, the sponsor of the investigation shall submit in triplicate to FDA a “Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug” including a signed statement containing the following information:</P>
            <P>(i) The identity of the new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(ii) All labeling and other pertinent information to be supplied to the investigators. When such pertinent information includes nonclinical laboratory studies, the information shall include, with respect to each nonclinical study, either a statement that the study was conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.</P>
            <P>(iii) The name and address of each clinical investigator.</P>
            <P>(iv) The approximate number of animals to be treated (or if not available, the amount of new animal drug to be shipped).</P>
            <P>(v) If the new animal drug is given to food-producing animals, the statement shall contain the following additional information:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) A commitment that the edible products from such animals shall not be used for food without prior authorization in accordance with the provisions prescribed in this section.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Approximate dates of the beginning and end of the experiment or series of experiments.</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) The maximum daily dose(s) to be administered to a given species, the size of animal, maximum duration of administration, method(s) of administration, and proposed withdrawal time, if any.</P>
            <P>(vi) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct of any clinical study to a contract research organization, a statement containing the name and address of the contract research organization, identification of the clinical study, and a listing of the obligations transferred. If all obligations governing the conduct of the study have been transferred, a general statement of this transfer—in lieu of a listing of the specific obligations transferred—may be submitted.</P>

            <P>(5) Authorization for use of edible products derived from a treated food-producing animal may be granted under the provisions of this section and when the following specified conditions are met, except that in the case of an animal administered any unlicensed experimental veterinary biological product regulated under the viruses, serums, toxins statute (21 U.S.C., chapter V, sec. 151 <E T="03">et seq.</E> ) the product shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when U.S. Department of Agriculture approval has been obtained as provided in 9 CFR 103.2. Conditional authorization may be granted in advance of identification of the name(s) and address(es) of the clinical investigator(s) as required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Information required for authorization shall include, in addition to all other requirements of this section, the following:</P>

            <P>(i) Data to show that consumption of food derived from animals treated at the maximum levels with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(<E T="03">c</E>) of this section, will not be inconsistent with the public health; or</P>

            <P>(ii) Data to show that food derived from animals treated at the maximum levels and with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(<E T="03">c</E>) of this section, does not contain drug residues or metabolites.</P>
            <P>(iii) The name and location of the packing plant where the animals will be processed, except that this requirement may be waived, on request, by the terms of the authorization.</P>

            <FP>Authorizations granted under this paragraph do not exempt investigational animals and their products from <PRTPAGE P="84"/>compliance with other applicable inspection requirements. Any person who contests a refusal to grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.</FP>
            <P>(6) On written request of FDA, the sponsor shall submit any additional information reported to or otherwise received by him with respect to the investigation deemed necessary to facilitate a determination whether there are grounds in the interest of public health for terminating the exemption.</P>
            <P>(7) The sponsor shall assure himself that the new animal drug is shipped only to investigators who:</P>
            <P>(i) Are qualified by scientific training and/experience to evaluate the safety and/or effectiveness of the new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(ii) Shall maintain complete records of the investigations, including complete records of the receipt and disposition of each shipment or delivery of the new animal drug under investigation. Copies of all records of the investigation shall be retained by the investigator for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal drug application.</P>
            <P>(iii) Shall furnish adequate and timely reports of the investigation to the sponsor.</P>
            <P>(8) The sponsor:</P>
            <P>(i) Shall retain all reports received from investigators for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal drug application and make such reports available to a duly authorized employee of the Department for inspection at all reasonable times.</P>
            <P>(ii) Shall provide for current monitoring of the investigation by a person qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate information obtained from the investigation, and shall promptly investigate and report to FDA and to all investigators any findings associated with use of the new animal drug that may suggest significant hazards pertinent to the safety of the new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(iii) Shall not unduly prolong distribution of the new animal drug for investigational use.</P>
            <P>(iv) Shall not, nor shall any person acting for or on behalf of the sponsor, represent that the new animal drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under investigation. This requirement is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information.</P>
            <P>(v) Shall not commercially distribute nor test-market the new animal drug until a new animal drug application is approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act.</P>
            <P>(9) If the shipment or other delivery of the new animal drug is imported or offered for importation into the United States for clinical investigational use in animals, it shall also meet the following conditions:</P>
            <P>(i) The importer of all such shipments or deliveries is an agent of the foreign exporter residing in the United States or the ultimate consignee, which person has, prior to such shipments and deliveries, informed FDA of his intention to import the new animal drug as sponsor in compliance with the conditions prescribed in this subdivision; or</P>
            <P>(ii) The new animal drug is shipped directly to a scientific institution with adequate facilities and qualified personnel to conduct laboratory or clinical investigations and is intended solely for use in such institutions and which institution has submitted a statement as sponsor of the investigation.</P>
            <P>(10) The sponsor shall submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.33 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Disqualification of a clinical investigator.</E> (1) If FDA has information indicating that an investigator (including a sponsor-investigator) has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of these exempting regulations or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter complained of and offer the investigator an opportunity to explain the matter in writing, or, at the option of the investigator, in an informal conference. If an explanation is offered and accepted by the Center for Veterinary <PRTPAGE P="85"/>Medicine, the Center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. If an explanation is offered but not accepted by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, the investigator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and eligible to conduct:</P>
            <P>(i) Any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit for a new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(2) After evaluating all available information, including any explanation presented by the investigator, if the Commissioner determines that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of the exempting regulations in this subchapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Commissioner will notify the investigator and the sponsor of any investigation in which the investigator has been named as a participant that the investigator is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. The notification to the investigator and sponsor will provide a statement of the basis for such determination. The notification also will explain that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test articles under this part will be ineligible to conduct:</P>
            <P>(i) Any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, including drugs, biologics, devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supplements, that bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant formulas, food and color additives, and tobacco products; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a research or marketing permit for a new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(3) Each application or submission to FDA under the provisions of this chapter containing data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be ineligible to receive FDA-regulated test articles is subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an investigation or essential to the approval of a marketing application, or essential to the continued marketing of an FDA-regulated product.</P>
            <P>(4) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the Commissioner will notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter. If a danger to the public health exists, however, the Commissioner shall terminate the exemption immediately and notify the sponsor of the termination. In such case, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA under part 16 on the question of whether the exemption should be reinstated. The determination that an investigation may not be considered in support of a research or marketing application or a notification or petition submission does not, however, relieve the sponsor of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit to FDA the results of the investigation.</P>
            <P>(5) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the continued approval of the product for which the data were submitted cannot be justified, the Commissioner will proceed to withdraw approval of the product in accordance with the applicable provisions of the relevant statutes.</P>

            <P>(6) An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible under paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be reinstated as eligible when the Commissioner determines that the investigator has presented adequate assurances that the investigator will employ all test articles, and will conduct any clinical investigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA and any nonclinical laboratory study intended to support an application for a <PRTPAGE P="86"/>research or marketing permit for a new animal drug, solely in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Termination of exemption.</E> If the Commissioner finds that:</P>
            <P>(1) The sponsor of the investigation has failed to comply with any of the conditions for the exemption established under this section, or</P>
            <P>(2) The continuance of the investigation is unsafe or otherwise contrary to the public interest or the drug is being or has been used for purposes other than bona fide scientific investigation, he shall first notify the sponsor and invite his immediate correction. If the conditions of the exemption are not immediately met, the sponsor shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before FDA pursuant of part 16 of this chapter on whether the exemption should be terminated. If the exemption is terminated the sponsor shall recall or have destroyed the unused supplies of the new animal drug.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Statements and requests.</E> “Notice(s) of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug” and requests for authorization to use investigational animals and their products for food should be addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Contract research organizations.</E> (1) For purposes of this part and part 514, <E T="03">contract research organization</E> means a person that assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of materials to be submitted to FDA.</P>
            <P>(2) A sponsor may transfer responsibility for any or all of the obligations set forth in this part to a contract research organization. Any such transfer shall be in writing and, if not all obligations are transferred, shall describe each of the obligations being assumed by the contract research organization. If all obligations are transferred, a general statement that all obligations have been transferred is acceptable. Any obligation not covered by the written description shall be deemed not to have been transferred.</P>

            <P>(3) A contract research organization that assumes any obligation of a sponsor shall comply with the specific regulations in this chapter applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same regulatory action as a sponsor for failure to comply with any obligation assumed under these regulations. Thus, all references to <E T="03">sponsor</E> in this part apply to a contract research organization to the extent that it assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor species.</E> All provisions of part 511 apply to new animal drugs for investigational use in support of indexing, as described in section 572 of the act, subject to the provisions of § 516.125 of this chapter.</P>

            <P>As used in this part:</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Contract research organization</E> means a person that assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of materials to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Investigator</E> means an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the drug is administered or dispensed to a subject). In the event an investigation is conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of the team. “Subinvestigator” includes any other individual member of that team.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Sponsor</E> means a person who takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation. The sponsor may be an individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organization, or other <PRTPAGE P="87"/>organization. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-investigator, and the employees are investigators.</P>
            <P>
              <E T="03">Sponsor-Investigator</E> means an individual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose immediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed. The term does not include any person other than an individual. The requirements applicable to a sponsor-investigator under this part include both those applicable to an investigator and a sponsor.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Substantial evidence.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definition of substantial evidence.</E> Substantial evidence means evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies, such as a study in a target species, study in laboratory animals, field study, bioequivalence study, or an in vitro study, on the basis of which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such adequate and well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound scientific judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will have its intended effect.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Characteristics of substantial evidence</E>—(1) <E T="03">Qualifications of experts.</E> Any study that is intended to be part of substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug shall be conducted by experts qualified by scientific training and experience.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Intended uses and conditions of use.</E> Substantial evidence of effectiveness of <PRTPAGE P="96"/>a new animal drug shall demonstrate that the new animal drug is effective for each intended use and associated conditions of use for and under which approval is sought.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Dose range labeling.</E> Sponsors should, to the extent possible, provide for a dose range because it increases the utility of the new animal drug by providing the user flexibility in the selection of a safe and effective dose. In general, substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal drug intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease must consist of at least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new animal drug will be effective for the intended use at the lowest dose of the dose range suggested in the proposed labeling for that intended use. Substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal drug intended to affect the structure or function of the body of an animal generally must consist of at least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new animal drug will be effective for the intended use at all doses within the range suggested in the proposed labeling for the intended use.</P>
              <P>(ii) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Studies</E>—(i) <E T="03">Number.</E> Substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug for each intended use and associated conditions of use shall consist of a sufficient number of current adequate and well-controlled studies of sufficient quality and persuasiveness to permit qualified experts:</P>
              <P>(A) To determine that the parameters selected for measurement and the measured responses reliably reflect the effectiveness of the new animal drug;</P>
              <P>(B) To determine that the results obtained are likely to be repeatable, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target animal population; and</P>
              <P>(C) To conclude that the new animal drug is effective for the intended use at the dose or dose range and associated conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Types.</E> Adequate and well-controlled studies that are intended to provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal drug may include, but are not limited to, published studies, foreign studies, studies using models, and studies conducted by or on behalf of the sponsor. Studies using models shall be validated to establish an adequate relationship of parameters measured and effects observed in the model with one or more significant effects of treatment.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Substantial evidence for combination new animal drugs</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The following definitions of terms apply to this section:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Combination new animal drug</E> means a new animal drug that contains more than one active ingredient or animal drug that is applied or administered simultaneously in a single dosage form or simultaneously in or on animal feed or drinking water.</P>

But, antibacterial does not include ionophores or arsenicals intended for use in combination in animal feed or drinking water.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Appropriate concurrent use</E> exists when there is credible evidence that the conditions for which the combination new animal drug is intended can occur simultaneously.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Combination new animal drugs that contain only active ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately approved.</E> (i) For dosage form combination new animal drugs, except for those that contain a nontopical antibacterial, that contain only active ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately approved for the particular uses and conditions of use for which they are intended in combination, a sponsor shall demonstrate:<PRTPAGE P="97"/>
              </P>
              <P>(A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;</P>
              <P>(B) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least one use that is different from all the other active ingredients or animal drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use for the intended target animal population; and</P>
              <P>(C) That the active ingredients or animal drugs are physically compatible and do not have disparate dosing regimens if FDA, based on scientific information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or animal drugs are physically incompatible or have disparate dosing regimens.</P>
              <P>(ii) For combination new animal drugs intended for use in animal feed or drinking water that contain only active ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately approved for the particular uses and conditions of use for which they are intended in combination, the sponsor shall demonstrate:</P>
              <P>(A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;</P>
              <P>(B) For such combination new animal drugs that contain more than one antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, by substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that each antibacterial makes a contribution to labeled effectiveness;</P>
              <P>(C) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least one use that is different from all other active ingredients or animal drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use for the intended target animal population; and</P>
              <P>(D) That the active ingredients or animal drugs intended for use in drinking water are physically compatible if FDA, based on scientific information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or animal drugs are physically incompatible.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other combination new animal drugs.</E> For all other combination new animal drugs, the sponsor shall demonstrate by substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that the combination new animal drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling and that each active ingredient or animal drug contributes to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Presubmission conferences.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General principle underlying the conduct of a presubmission conference.</E> The general principle underlying the conduct of any presubmission conference is that there should be candid, full, and open communication.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Requesting a presubmission conference.</E> A potential applicant is entitled to one or more conferences prior to the submission of an NADA, supplemental NADA, or an ANADA to reach an agreement establishing part or all of a submission or investigational requirement. A potential applicant's request for a presubmission conference must be submitted to FDA in a signed letter. The letter must include a proposed agenda that clearly outlines the scope, purpose, and objectives of the presubmission conference and must list the names and positions of the representatives who are expected to attend the presubmission conference on behalf of the applicant.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Timing.</E> A potential applicant may request one or more presubmission conferences at any time prior to the filing of a NADA, supplemental NADA, or an ANADA. A request for a presubmission conference must be received by FDA at least 30 calendar days in advance of the requested conference date. FDA will schedule the presubmission conference at a time agreeable to both FDA and the potential applicant.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Advance information.</E> The potential applicant must provide to FDA, at least 30 calendar days before a scheduled presubmission conference, a detailed agenda, a copy of any materials to be presented at the conference, a list <PRTPAGE P="98"/>of proposed indications and, if available, a copy of the proposed labeling for the product under consideration, and copies of materials evaluated or referenced relative to issues listed in the agenda for the conference. If the materials are not provided or are not sufficient to provide the basis for meaningful discussion, FDA may elect to postpone part or all of the meeting until sufficient materials are provided to FDA.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Conduct of a presubmission conference.</E> The potential applicant and FDA may each bring consultants to the presubmission conference. The presubmission conference(s) will be directed primarily at establishing agreement between FDA and the potential applicant regarding a submission or investigational requirement. The submission or investigational requirement may include, among other things, the number, types, and general design of studies that are necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a new animal drug for the intended uses and conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling for the new animal drug.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Documentation of a presubmission conference</E>—(1) <E T="03">Memorandum of conference</E>—(i) <E T="03">Preparation.</E> FDA will prepare a memorandum for each presubmission conference that will include, among other things, any background pertinent to the request for meeting; a summary of the key points of discussion; agreements; and action items and assignments of responsibility. That portion of the memorandum of conference that documents any agreements reached regarding all or part of a submission or investigational requirement will be included under the heading “Presubmission Conference Agreement.” If the presubmission conference agreement section of the memorandum is silent on an issue, including one that was discussed in the conference or addressed by materials provided for the conference, such silence does not constitute agreement between FDA and the potential applicant on the issue.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Sending a copy to the potential applicant.</E> FDA will send a copy of the memorandum to the potential applicant for review no later than 45 calendar days after the date of the conference</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Requests for changes or clarification.</E> If a potential applicant requests changes to, or clarification of, the substance of the memorandum, the request must be sent to FDA within 30 calendar days from the date a copy of the memorandum is sent to the applicant. If the potential applicant requests changes or clarification, FDA will send the potential applicant a response to their request no later than 45 calendar days after the date of receipt of the request.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Administrative record.</E> A copy of FDA's original memorandum of conference and, as appropriate, a copy of an amended memorandum to correct or clarify the content of the original memorandum will be made part of the administrative file.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Field studies.</E> If FDA requires more than one field study to establish by substantial evidence that the new animal drug is effective for its intended uses under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, FDA will provide written scientific justification for requiring more than one field study. Such justification must be provided no later than 25 calendar days after the date of the conference at which the requirement for more than one field study is established. If FDA does not believe more than one field study is required but the potential applicant voluntarily proposes to conduct more than one field study, FDA will not provide such written justification. If FDA requires one field study to be conducted at multiple locations, FDA will provide justification for requiring multiple locations verbally during the presubmission conference and in writing as part of the memorandum of conference.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Modification of presubmission conference agreements.</E> An agreement made under a presubmission conference requested under section 512(b)(3) of the act and documented in a memorandum of conference is binding on the potential applicant and FDA and may only be modified if:</P>

              <P>(1) FDA and the potential applicant mutually agree to modify, in part or in <PRTPAGE P="99"/>whole, the agreement and such modification is documented and provided to the potential applicant as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; or</P>
              <P>(2) FDA by written order determines that a substantiated scientific requirement essential to the determination of safety or effectiveness of the new animal drug appeared after the conference.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">When the terms of a presubmission conference agreement are not valid</E> (1) A presubmission conference agreement will no longer be valid if:</P>
              <P>(i) The potential applicant makes to FDA, before, during, or after the presubmission conference, any untrue statement of material fact; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The potential applicant fails to follow any material term of the agreement; and</P>
              <P>(2) A presubmission conference may no longer be valid if the potential applicant submits false or misleading data relating to a new animal drug to FDA.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Dispute resolution.</E> FDA is committed to resolving differences between a potential applicant and FDA reviewing divisions with respect to requirements for the investigation of new animal drugs and for NADAs, supplemental NADAs, and ANADAs as quickly and amicably as possible through a cooperative exchange of information and views. When administrative or procedural disputes arise, a potential applicant should first attempt to resolve the matter within the appropriate review division beginning with the individual(s) most directly assigned to the review of the application or investigational exemption. If the dispute cannot be resolved after such attempts, the dispute shall be evaluated and administered in accordance with applicable regulations (21 CFR 10.75). Dispute resolution procedures may be further explained by guidance available from the Center for Veterinary Medicine.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Annual reports for antimicrobial animal drug sales and distribution.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The applicant for each new animal drug product approved under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or conditionally approved under section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and containing an antimicrobial active ingredient, must submit an annual report to FDA on the amount of each such antimicrobial active ingredient in the drug that is sold or distributed in the reporting year for use in food-producing animal species, including information on any distributor-labeled product.</P>
              <P>(b) This report must identify the approved or conditionally approved application and must include the following information for each new animal drug product described in paragraph (a) of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) A listing of each antimicrobial active ingredient contained in the product;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of each product sold or distributed by unit, including the container size, strength, and dosage form of such product units;</P>
              <P>(3) For each such product, a listing of the target animal species, indications, and production classes that are specified on the approved label;</P>

              <P>(4) For each such product, the number of units sold or distributed in the United States (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> domestic sales) for each month of the reporting year; and</P>

              <P>(5) For each such product, the number of units sold or distributed outside the United States (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> quantities exported) for each month of the reporting year.</P>
              <P>(c) Each report must also provide a species-specific estimate of the percentage of each product described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section that was sold or distributed domestically in the reporting year for use in any of the following animal species categories, but only for such species that appear on the approved label: Cattle, swine, chickens, turkeys. The total of the species-specific percentages reported for each product must account for 100 percent of its sales and distribution; therefore, a fifth category of “other species/unknown” must also be reported.</P>
              <P>(d) Each report must:</P>
              <P>(1) Be submitted not later than March 31 each year;</P>
              <P>(2) Cover the period of the preceding calendar year; and</P>
              <P>(3) Be submitted using Form FDA 3744, “Antimicrobial Animal Drug Distribution Report.”</P>
              <P>(e) Sales and distribution data and information reported under this section will be considered to fall within the exemption for confidential commercial information established in § 20.61 of this chapter and will not be publicly disclosed, except that summary reports of such information aggregated in such a way that does not reveal information that is not available for public disclosure under this provision will be prepared by FDA and made available to the public as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</P>
              <P>(f) FDA will publish an annual summary report of the data and information it receives under this section for each calendar year by December 31 of the following year. Such annual reports must include a summary of sales and distribution data and information by antimicrobial drug class and may include additional summary data and information as determined by FDA. In order to protect confidential commercial information, each individual datum appearing in the summary report must:</P>

              <P>(1) Reflect combined product sales and distribution data and information obtained from three or more distinct sponsors of approved products that <PRTPAGE P="114"/>were actively sold or distributed that reporting year, and</P>
              <P>(2) Be reported in a manner consistent with protecting both national security and confidential commercial information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Evaluation and comment on applications.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After the filed application has been evaluated, the applicant will be furnished written comment on any apparent deficiencies in the application.</P>
              <P>(b) When the description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such new animal drug appears adequate on its face, but it is not feasible to reach a conclusion as to the safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug solely from consideration of this description, the applicant may be notified that an establishment inspection is required to verify their adequacy.</P>
              <P>(c) A request for samples of a new animal drug or any edible tissues and byproducts of animals treated with such a drug, shall specify the quantity deemed adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to determine their adequacy for regulatory purposes. The request should be made as early in the 180-day period as possible to assure timely completion. The date used for computing the 180-day limit for the purposes of section 512(c) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day for each day after the mailing date of the request until all of the requested samples are received. If the samples are not received within 90 days after the request, the application will be considered withdrawn without prejudice.</P>
              <P>(d) The information contained in an application may be insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe or effective in use if it fails to include (among other things) a statement showing whether such drug is to be limited to prescription sale and exempt under section 502(f) of the act from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for lay use. If such drug is to be exempt, the information may also be insufficient if:</P>
              <P>(1) The specimen labeling proposed fails to bear adequate information for professional use including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions under which practitioners licensed by law to administer such drug can use the drug for the purposes for which it is intended, including all purposes for which it is to be advertised, or represented, in accordance with § 201.105 of this chapter, and information concerning hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions relevant with respect to any uses for which such drug is to be prescribed.</P>
              <P>(2) The application fails to show that the labeling and advertising of such drug will offer the drug for use only under those conditions for which it is offered in the labeling that is part of the application.</P>
              <P>(3) The application fails to show that all labeling that furnishes or purports to furnish information for professional use of such drug will contain, in the same language and emphasis, the information for use including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions, which is contained in the labeling that is part of the application in accordance with § 201.105 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) The information contained in an application will be considered insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe and effective for use when there is a refusal or failure upon written notice to furnish inspectors authorized by the Food and Drug Administration an adequate opportunity to inspect the facilities, controls, and records pertinent to the application.</P>
              <P>(f) On the basis of preliminary consideration of an application or supplemental application containing typewritten or other draft labeling in lieu of final printed labeling, an applicant may be informed that such application is approvable when satisfactory final printed labeling identical in content to such draft copy is submitted.</P>

              <P>(g) When an application has been found incomplete on the basis of a need for the kind of information described <PRTPAGE P="115"/>in § 514.6, such application shall be considered withdrawn without prejudice to future filing on the date of issuance of the letter citing the inadequacies contained in the application, unless within 30 days the sponsor chooses to avail himself of the opportunity for hearing as prescribed by § 514.111.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Adequate and well-controlled studies.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Purpose.</E> The primary purpose of conducting adequate and well-controlled studies of a new animal drug is to distinguish the effect of the new animal drug from other influences, such as spontaneous change in the course of the disease, normal animal production performance, or biased observation. One or more adequate and well-controlled studies are required to establish, by substantial evidence, that a new animal drug is effective. The characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this section have been developed over a period of years and are generally recognized as the essentials of an adequate and well-controlled study. Well controlled, as used in the phrase adequate and well controlled, emphasizes <PRTPAGE P="120"/>an important aspect of adequacy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers these characteristics in determining whether a study is adequate and well controlled for purposes of section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360b). Adequate and well-controlled studies, in addition to providing a basis for determining whether a new animal drug is effective, may also be relied upon to support target animal safety. The report of an adequate and well-controlled study should provide sufficient details of study design, conduct, and analysis to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Characteristics.</E> An adequate and well-controlled study has the following characteristics:</P>
              <P>(1) The protocol for the study (protocol) and the report of the study results (study report) must include a clear statement of the study objective(s).</P>
              <P>(2) The study is conducted in accordance with an appropriate standard of conduct that addresses, among other issues, study conduct, study personnel, study facilities, and study documentation. The protocol contains a statement acknowledging the applicability of, and intention to follow, a standard of conduct acceptable to FDA. The study report contains a statement describing adherence to the standard.</P>
              <P>(3) The study is conducted with a new animal drug that is produced in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the critical characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, and physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with other studies conducted with the new animal drug. The physical form of a new animal drug includes the formulation and physical characterization (including delivery systems thereof, if any) of the new animal drug as presented to the animal. The protocol and study report must include an identification number which can be correlated with the specific formulation and production process used to manufacture the new animal drug used in the study.</P>
              <P>(4) The study uses a design that permits a valid comparison with one or more controls to provide a quantitative evaluation of drug effects. The protocol and the study report must describe the precise nature of the study design, e.g., duration of treatment periods, whether treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and the determination of sample size. Within the broad range of studies conducted to support a determination of the effectiveness of a new animal drug, certain of the controls listed below would be appropriate and preferred depending on the study conducted:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Placebo concurrent control.</E> The new animal drug is compared with an inactive preparation designed to resemble the new animal drug as far as possible.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Untreated concurrent control.</E> The new animal drug is compared with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to observer bias, are available.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Active treatment concurrent control.</E> The new animal drug is compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of the animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control drug can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous placebo-controlled studies of the active control.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Historical control.</E> The results of treatment with the new animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condition, or with a <PRTPAGE P="121"/>regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic) whose effectiveness is established, in comparable animals. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the new animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity.</P>
              <P>(5) The study uses a method of selecting animals that provides adequate assurances that the animals are suitable for the purposes of the study. For example, the animals can reasonably be expected to have animal production characteristics typical of the class(es) of animals for which the new animal drug is intended, there is adequate assurance that the animals have the disease or condition being studied, or, in the case of prophylactic agents, evidence of susceptibility and exposure to the condition against which prophylaxis is desired has been provided. The protocol and the study report describe the method of selecting animals for the study.</P>
              <P>(6) The study uses a method to assign a treatment or a control to each experimental unit of animals that is random and minimizes bias. Experimental units of animals are groups of animals that are comparable with respect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, class of animal, severity of disease, duration of disease, dietary regimen, level of animal production, and use of drugs or therapy other than the new animal drug. The protocol and the study report describe the method of assignment of animals to an experimental unit to account for pertinent variables and method of assignment of a treatment or a control to the experimental units. When the effect of such variables is accounted for by an appropriate design, and when, within the same animal, effects due to the test drug can be obtained free of the effects of such variables, the same animal may be used for both the test drug and the control using the controls set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(7) The study uses methods to minimize bias on the part of observers and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences on the results and interpretation of the study data. The protocol and study report explain the methods of observation and recording of the animal response variables and document the methods, such as “blinding” or “masking,” used in the study for excluding or minimizing bias in the observations.</P>
              <P>(8) The study uses methods to assess animal response that are well defined and reliable. The protocol and study report describe the methods for conducting the study, including any appropriate analytical and statistical methods, used to collect and analyze the data resulting from the conduct of the study, describe the criteria used to assess response, and, when appropriate, justify the selection of the methods to assess animal response.</P>
              <P>(9) There is an analysis and evaluation of the results of the study in accord with the protocol adequate to assess the effects of the new animal drug. The study report evaluates the methods used to conduct, and presents and evaluates the results of, the study as to their adequacy to assess the effects of the new animal drug. This evaluation of the results of the study assesses, among other items, the comparability of treatment and control groups with respect to pertinent variables and the effects of any interim analyses performed.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Field studies.</E> (1) Field conditions as used in this section refers to conditions which closely approximate the conditions under which the new animal drug, if approved, is intended to be applied or administered.</P>

              <P>(2) Studies of a new animal drug conducted under field conditions shall, consistent with generally recognized scientific principles and procedures, use an appropriate control that permits comparison, employ procedures to minimize bias, and have the characteristics generally described in paragraph (b) of this section. However, because field studies are conducted under field conditions, it is recognized that the <PRTPAGE P="122"/>level of control over some study conditions need not or should not be the same as the level of control in laboratory studies. While not all conditions relating to a field study need to be or should be controlled, observations of the conditions under which the new animal drug is tested shall be recorded in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the study. Adequate and well-controlled field studies shall balance the need to control study conditions with the need to observe the true effect of the new animal drug under closely approximated actual use conditions.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Waiver.</E> The Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the Director) may, on the Director's own initiative or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a specific study. A petition for a waiver is required to set forth clearly and concisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the criteria are not reasonably applicable to the particular study, what alternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and what results have been obtained. The petition is also required to state why the studies so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial evidence of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the criteria for which waiver is requested.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Uncontrolled studies.</E> Uncontrolled studies or partially controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval of claims of effectiveness or target animal safety. Such studies, carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of adequate and well-controlled studies regarding effectiveness and may yield valuable data regarding safety of the new animal drug. Such studies will be considered on their merits in light of the characteristics listed here. Isolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will not be considered.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Notice of opportunity for hearing; notice of participation and requests for hearing; grant or denial of hearing.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal by the Commissioner to refuse to approve an application or to withdraw the approval of an application will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> together with an explanation of the grounds for the proposed action. The notice will describe how to request a hearing. An applicant has 30 days after publication of the notice to request a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) If the applicant fails to request a hearing within the 30-day timeframe, the Commissioner, without further notice, will publish a final order denying or withdrawing approval of the application.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicant desires to request a hearing:</P>

              <P>(1) Within 30 days after publication of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the applicant must submit to the Division of Dockets Management written objections and a request for a hearing in accordance with §§ 12.20 and 12.22. <PRTPAGE P="123"/>This request for a hearing must include each specific objection to the proposal on which a hearing is requested, together with a detailed description and analysis of the factual information (including all relevant clinical and other investigational data) the applicant will present in support of that objection. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions or contentions, but must set forth specific reliable evidence showing there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing.</P>
              <P>(2) If the Commissioner determines upon review of the data and information submitted in the objections and request for a hearing that a hearing is not justified because no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve the application or the withdrawal of approval of the application (for example, the applicant has not identified any adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations to support the claims of effectiveness), the Commissioner will enter an order denying the hearing and stating the final findings and conclusions.</P>
              <P>(3) If the Commissioner determines upon review of the data and information submitted in the objections and request for a hearing that a hearing is justified, the Commissioner will publish a notice setting forth the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The regulation or order that is the subject of the hearing;</P>
              <P>(ii) A statement specifying any part of the regulation or order that has been stayed by operation of law or in the Commissioner's discretion;</P>
              <P>(iii) The parties to the hearing;</P>
              <P>(iv) The specific issues of fact for resolution at the hearing;</P>
              <P>(v) The presiding officer, or a statement that the presiding officer will be designated in a later notice; and</P>
              <P>(vi) The date, time, and place of the prehearing conference, or a statement that the date, time, and place will be announced in a later notice. However, in the case of a denial of approval, the hearing must not occur more than 90 days after expiration of the 30-day time period in which to request a hearing, unless the presiding officer and the applicant otherwise agree; and in the case of withdrawal of approval, the hearing will occur as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so specifies in the request for a hearing.</P>

              <P>(c) The Commissioner may notify in writing the person holding an application approved under section 512(m)(2) of the act and afford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to revoke approval of such application if the Commissioner finds:</P>
              <P>(1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with a regulation or order under sections 512(m)(5)(A) or 504(a)(3)(A) of the act, or the applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or verification of, such records as required by sections 512(m)(5)(B) or 504(a)(3)(B) of the act; or</P>
              <P>(2) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the new animal drug therein, and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or</P>
              <P>(3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the labeling of any animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or</P>
              <P>(4) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the facility has manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed bearing or containing a new animal drug adulterated under section 501(a)(6) of the act, and the facility did not discontinue the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of such animal feed within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner specifying the matter complained of.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Contents of notice of opportunity for a hearing.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) to refuse to approve a medicated feed mill license application or to revoke the approval of a medicated feed mill license will specify the grounds upon which the Commissioner proposes to issue this order. On request of the applicant, the Commissioner will explain the reasons for the action. The notice of opportunity for a hearing will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance of the notice within which the Commissioner is required to file a written appearance electing whether:</P>
              <P>(1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or</P>
              <P>(2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.</P>
              <P>(b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to the notice of opportunity for hearing, this failure will be construed as an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.</P>
              <P>(c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing, the applicant is required to file a written appearance requesting the hearing within 30 days after the publication of the notice, giving the reason why the application should not be refused or the medicated feed mill license should not be revoked, together with a well-organized and full-factual analysis of the information the applicant is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the Commissioner's proposal. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. When it clearly appears from the information in the application and from the reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve the application or the revocation of approval of the application, the Commissioner will enter an order on this information, stating his/her findings and conclusions. If a hearing is requested and is justified by the applicant's response to the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the issues will be defined, an Administrative Law Judge will be named, and the Judge shall issue a written notice of the time and place at which the hearing will commence. In the case of denial of approval, such time shall be not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days unless the Administrative Law Judge and the applicant otherwise agree; and, in the case of withdrawal of approval, such time shall be as soon as practicable.</P>
              <P>(d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so specifies in the appearance.</P>

              <P>(a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to those terms when used in this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The following definitions of terms apply to all subparts of part 516:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Active moiety</E> means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the molecule, responsible for the pharmacological action of the drug substance.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Functionally superior</E> means that a drug has been shown to provide a significant therapeutic or physiologic advantage over that provided by a conditionally-approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug, in one or more of the following ways:</P>
              <P>(i) The drug has been shown to be more effective, as assessed by effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, than a conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug. Generally, this would represent the same kind of evidence needed to support a comparative effectiveness claim for two different drugs; in most cases, direct comparative clinical trials will be necessary; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The drug has been shown to be safer than a conditionally-approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug, in a substantial portion of the target population, for example, by the elimination of an ingredient or contaminant that is associated with relatively frequent adverse effects. In some cases, direct comparative clinical trials will be necessary.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Infrequently</E>, as used in the minor use definition, means a disease or condition that is uncommon or that occurs only sporadically on an annualized basis.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Limited geographical areas</E>, as used in the minor use definition, means regions of the United States distinguished by physical, chemical, or biological factors that limit the distribution of a disease or condition.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Major species</E> means cattle, horses, swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Minor species</E> means animals, other than humans, that are not major species.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Minor use</E> means the intended use of a drug in a major species for an indication that occurs infrequently and in only a small number of animals or in limited geographical areas and in only a small number of animals annually.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">MUMS drug</E> means a new animal drug, as defined in section 201 of the act, intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Same dosage form</E> means the same as one of the dosage form categories specified in the following parts of this chapter:</P>
              <P>(i) Part 520: Oral dosage form new animal drugs (excluding use in animal feeds as specified in part 558 of this chapter).</P>
              <P>(ii) Part 522: Implantation or injectable dosage form new animal drugs.</P>
              <P>(iii) Part 524: Ophthalmic and topical dosage form new animal drugs.</P>
              <P>(iv) Part 526: Intramammary dosage forms.</P>
              <P>(v) Part 529: Certain other dosage form new animal drugs.</P>

              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Same drug</E> means a MUMS drug for which designation, indexing, or conditional approval is sought that meets the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) If it is a MUMS drug composed of small molecules and contains the same active moiety as a prior designated, conditionally-approved, or approved MUMS drug, even if the particular ester or salt (including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds) or other noncovalent derivative such as a complex, chelate or clathrate is not the same, it is considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug.</P>
              <P>(ii) If it is a MUMS drug composed of large molecules (macromolecules) and contains the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same structural features) as a prior designated, conditionally approved, or approved MUMS drug, it is considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug. This criterion will be applied as follows to different kinds of macromolecules:</P>
              <P>(A) Two protein drugs would be considered the same if the only differences in structure between them were due to post-translational events or infidelity of translation or transcription or were minor differences in amino acid sequence; other potentially important differences, such as different glycosylation patterns or different tertiary structures, would not cause the drugs to be considered different unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.</P>
              <P>(B) Two polysaccharide drugs would be considered the same if they had identical saccharide repeating units, even if the number of units were to vary and even if there were postpolymerization modifications, unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.</P>
              <P>(C) Two polynucleotide drugs consisting of two or more distinct nucleotides would be considered the same if they had an identical sequence of purine and pyrimidine bases (or their derivatives) bound to an identical sugar backbone (ribose, deoxyribose, or modifications of these sugars), unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.</P>
              <P>(D) Closely related, complex partly definable drugs with similar pharmacologic intent would be considered the same unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Same intended use</E> means an intended use of a MUMS drug, for which designation, indexing, or conditional approval is sought, that is determined to be the same as (or not different from) a previously designated, conditionally approved, or approved intended use of a MUMS drug. Same intended use is established by comparing two intended uses and not by simply comparing the specific language by means of which the intent is established in labeling in accordance with the following criteria:</P>
              <P>(i) Two intended uses are considered the same if one of the intended uses falls completely within the scope of the other.</P>
              <P>(ii) For intended uses associated with diseases or conditions with multiple causative organisms, two intended uses are not considered the same when they involve different causative organisms or different subsets of causative organisms of that disease or condition when the causative organisms involved can reliably be shown to be clinically significant causes of the disease or condition.</P>
              <P>(iii) Two intended uses of a drug are not considered the same if they involve different intended species or different definable subpopulations (including “production classes”) of a species.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Small number of animals</E> means equal to or less than 50,000 horses; 70,000 dogs; 120,000 cats; 310,000 cattle; 1,450,000 pigs; 14,000,000 turkeys; and 72,000,000 chickens.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sponsor</E> means the person requesting designation for a MUMS drug who must be the real party in interest of the development and the intended or actual production and sales of such drug (in this context, the sponsor may <PRTPAGE P="131"/>be an individual, partnership, organization, or association). Sponsor also means the person responsible for an investigation of a new animal drug (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, partnership, corporation, or Government agency or may be a manufacturer, scientific institution, or an investigator regularly and lawfully engaged in the investigation of new animal drugs). Sponsor also means the person submitting or receiving approval for a new animal drug application (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, partnership, organization, or association).

              <P>(a) A sponsor that submits a request for designation of a new animal drug intended for a minor use or minor species must submit each request in the form and containing the information required in paragraph (b) of this section. While a request for designation may involve multiple intended uses, each request for designation must constitute a separate submission. A sponsor may request MUMS-drug designation of a previously unapproved drug, or a new intended use or dosage form for an already conditionally approved or approved drug. Only one sponsor may receive MUMS-drug designation of <PRTPAGE P="132"/>the same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended use.</P>
              <P>(b) A sponsor must submit two copies of a completed, dated, and signed request for designation that contains the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) A request for designation of a new animal drug for a minor use or use in a minor species, which must be specific.</P>
              <P>(2) The name and address of the sponsor; the name of the sponsor's primary contact person and/or permanent-resident U.S. agent including title, address, and telephone number; the established name (and proprietary name, if any) of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug; and the name and address of the source of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug.</P>
              <P>(3) A description of the proposed intended use for which the drug is being or will be investigated.</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the drug and dosage form.</P>
              <P>(5) A discussion of the scientific rationale for the intended use of the drug; specific reference, including date(s) of submission, to all data from nonclinical laboratory studies, clinical investigations, copies of pertinent unpublished and published papers, and other relevant data that are available to the sponsor, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive.</P>
              <P>(6) A specific description of the product development plan for the drug, its dosage form, and its intended use.</P>
              <P>(7) If the drug is intended for a minor use in a major species, documentation in accordance with § 516.21, with appended authoritative references, to demonstrate that such use is a minor use.</P>
              <P>(8) A statement that the sponsor submitting the request is the real party in interest of the development and the intended or actual production and sales of the product.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Documentation of minor use status.</SUBJECT>
              <P>So that FDA can determine whether a drug qualifies for MUMS-drug designation as a minor use in a major species under section 573 of the act, the sponsor shall include in its request to FDA for MUMS-drug designation under § 516.20 documentation demonstrating that the use is limited to a small number of animals (annualized). This documentation must include the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) The estimated total number of animals to which the drug could potentially be administered on an annual basis for the treatment, control, or prevention of the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed, including animals administered the drug as part of herd or flock treatment, together with a list of the sources (including dates of information provided and literature citations) for the estimate.</P>
              <P>(b) The estimated total number of animals referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be further reduced to only a subset of the estimated total number of animals if administration of the drug is only medically justified for this subset. To establish this, requestors must demonstrate that administration of the drug to animals subject to the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed other than the subset is not medically justified. The sponsor must also include a list of the sources (including dates of information provided and literature citations) for the justification that administration of the drug to animals other than the targeted subset is medically inappropriate.</P>

              <P>(a) FDA will refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if any of the following reasons apply:</P>
              <P>(1) The drug is not intended for use in a minor species or FDA determines that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the drug is intended for a minor use in a major species.</P>
              <P>(2) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use as one that already has a MUMS-drug designation but has not yet been conditionally approved or approved.</P>
              <P>(3) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use as one that is already conditionally approved or approved. A drug that FDA has found to be functionally superior is not considered the same drug as an already conditionally approved or approved drug even if it is otherwise the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use.</P>
              <P>(4) The sponsor has failed to provide:</P>
              <P>(i) A credible scientific rationale in support of the intended use,</P>
              <P>(ii) Sufficient information about the product development plan for the drug, its dosage form, and its intended use to establish that adherence to the plan can lead to successful drug development in a timely manner, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any other information required under § 516.20.</P>
              <P>(b) FDA may refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if the request for designation contains an untrue statement of material fact or omits material information.</P>

              <P>(a) At any time prior to conditional approval or approval of an application for a MUMS-designated drug, the sponsor may apply for an amendment to the designated intended use if the proposed change is due to new and unexpected findings in research on the drug, information arising from FDA recommendations, or other unforeseen developments.</P>
              <P>(b) FDA will grant the amendment if it finds:</P>
              <P>(1) That the initial designation request was made in good faith;</P>
              <P>(2) That the amendment is intended to make the MUMS-drug designated intended use conform to the results of new and unexpected findings in research on the drug, information arising from FDA recommendations, or other unforeseen developments; and</P>
              <P>(3) In the case of a minor use, that as of the date of the submission of the amendment request, the amendment would not result in the intended use of the drug no longer being considered a minor use.</P>

              <P>(a) A sponsor may transfer sponsorship of a MUMS-designated drug to another person. A change of sponsorship will also transfer the designation status of the drug which will remain in effect for the new sponsor subject to the same conditions applicable to the former sponsor provided that at the time of a potential transfer, the new <PRTPAGE P="134"/>and former sponsors submit the following information in writing and obtain permission from FDA:</P>
              <P>(1) The former sponsor shall submit a letter to FDA that documents the transfer of sponsorship of the MUMS-designated drug. This letter shall specify the date of the transfer. The former sponsor shall also certify in writing to FDA that a complete copy of the request for MUMS-drug designation, including any amendments to the request, and correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation, has been provided to the new sponsor.</P>
              <P>(2) The new sponsor shall submit a letter or other document containing the following information:</P>

              <P>(ii) The date that the change in sponsorship is intended to be effective;</P>
              <P>(iii) A statement that the new sponsor has a complete copy of the request for MUMS-drug designation, including any amendments to the request and any correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation;</P>

              <P>(v) The name and address of a new primary contact person or permanent resident U.S. agent; and</P>
              <P>(vi) Evidence that the new sponsor is capable of actively pursuing approval with due diligence.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Termination of MUMS-drug designation.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug must notify FDA of any decision to discontinue active pursuit of conditional approval or approval of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate the designation upon such notification.</P>
              <P>(b) A conditionally-approved or approved MUMS-designated drug sponsor must notify FDA at least 1 year before it intends to discontinue the manufacture of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate designation upon such notification.</P>
              <P>(c) MUMS designation shall terminate upon the expiration of any applicable period of exclusive marketing rights under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(d) FDA may terminate designation if it independently determines that the sponsor is not actively pursuing conditional approval or approval with due diligence. At a minimum, due diligence must be demonstrated by:</P>
              <P>(1) Submission of annual progress reports in a timely manner in accordance with § 516.30 that demonstrate that the sponsor is progressing in accordance with the drug development plan submitted to the agency under § 516.20 and</P>
              <P>(2) Compliance with all applicable requirements of part 511 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) Designation of a conditionally approved or approved MUMS-designated drug and the associated exclusive marketing rights may be terminated if the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs for which it is designated.</P>
              <P>(f) FDA may also terminate MUMS-drug designation for any drug if the agency finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact; or</P>

              <P>(2) The request for designation omitted material information required by this subpart; or<PRTPAGE P="135"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) FDA subsequently finds that the drug in fact had not been eligible for MUMS-drug designation at the time of submission of the request;</P>
              <P>(4) The same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended use becomes conditionally approved or approved for another sponsor; or</P>
              <P>(5) FDA withdraws the conditional approval or approval of the application for the new animal drug.</P>
              <P>(g) For a conditionally approved or approved drug, termination of MUMS-drug designation also terminates the sponsor's exclusive marketing rights for the drug but does not withdraw the conditional approval or approval of the drug's application.</P>
              <P>(h) Where a drug has been MUMS-designated for a minor use in a major species, its designation will not be terminated on the grounds that the number of animals to which the drug could potentially be administered on an annual basis for the treatment, control, or prevention of the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed, including animals administered the drug as part of herd or flock treatment, subsequently increases.</P>
              <P>(i) When a MUMS-drug designation is terminated, FDA will notify the sponsor in writing and will give public notice of the termination of the MUMS-drug designation.</P>

              <P>Within 14 months after the date on which a MUMS drug is granted designation and annually thereafter until approval, the sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug shall submit a brief progress report on the drug to the investigational new animal drug file addressed to the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development that includes the following information:</P>
              <P>(a) A short account of the progress of drug development including a description of studies initiated, ongoing, and completed, and a short summary of the status or results of such studies;</P>
              <P>(b) A description of the investigational plan for the coming year, as well as any anticipated difficulties in development, testing, and marketing; and</P>
              <P>(c) A brief discussion of any changes that may affect the MUMS-designated drug status of the product. For example, situations in which testing data demonstrate that the proposed intended use is inappropriate due to unexpected issues of safety or effectiveness.</P>

              <P>(a) FDA will send the sponsor (or the permanent-resident U.S. agent, if applicable) timely written notice recognizing exclusive marketing rights when an application for a MUMS-designated drug has been conditionally approved <PRTPAGE P="136"/>or approved. The written notice will inform the sponsor of the requirements for maintaining MUMS-designated drug exclusive marketing rights for the full 7-year term. This notice will generally be contained in the letter conditionally approving or approving the application.</P>

              <P>(b) When an application is conditionally approved or approved for a MUMS-designated drug that qualifies for exclusive marketing rights, FDA will publish this information in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> at the time of the conditional approval or approval. This notice will generally be contained in the notice of conditional approval or approval of the application.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Insufficient quantities of MUMS-designated drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Under section 573 of the act, whenever FDA has reason to believe that sufficient quantities of a conditionally-approved or approved, MUMS-designated drug to meet the needs for which the drug was designated cannot be assured by the sponsor, FDA will so notify the sponsor of this possible insufficiency and will offer the sponsor the following options, one of which must be exercised by a time that FDA specifies:</P>
              <P>(1) Provide FDA information and data regarding how the sponsor can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated drug within a reasonable time to meet the needs for which the drug was designated; or</P>
              <P>(2) Provide FDA in writing the sponsor's consent for the conditional approval or approval of other applications for the same drug before the expiration of the 7-year period of exclusive marketing rights.</P>
              <P>(b) If, within the time that FDA specifies, the sponsor fails to consent to the conditional approval or approval of other applications and if FDA finds that the sponsor has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated drug to meet the needs for which the drug was designated, FDA will issue a written order terminating designation of the MUMS drug and the associated exclusive marketing rights. This order will state FDA's findings and conclusions and will constitute final agency action. An order terminating designation and associated exclusive marketing rights may issue whether or not there are other sponsors that can assure the availability of alternative sources of supply. Such an order will not withdraw the conditional approval or approval of an application. Once terminated under this section, neither designation, nor exclusive marketing rights may be reinstated.</P>

              <P>(iii) Each submission of a request for a modification described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section should contain only one type of modification unless one modification is actually necessitated by another, such as a modification of dose necessitated by a modification of the concentration of an active ingredient. Submissions relating to addition of an intended use for an existing species or addition of a species should be submitted separately, but each such submission may include multiple additional intended uses and/or multiple additional species.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Minor changes.</E> All modifications other than those described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section including, but not limited to, formulation, labeling, and manufacturing methods and controls (at the same level of detail that these were described in the request for determination of eligibility for indexing) must be submitted as part of the annual indexed drug experience report or as otherwise required by § 516.165.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Removal from the index.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) After due notice to the holder of the index listing and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123, FDA shall remove a new animal drug from the index if FDA finds that:</P>
              <P>(1) The same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use has been approved or conditionally approved;</P>
              <P>(2) The expert panel failed to meet the requirements in § 516.141;</P>
              <P>(3) On the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together with the evidence available to FDA when the new animal drug was listed in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account the harm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved new animal drug for the minor species in question;</P>
              <P>(4) Any of the conditions in § 516.133(a)(2), (5), or (6) are present;</P>
              <P>(5) The manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with current good manufacturing practices;</P>
              <P>(6) The labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug is not in accordance with the index listing;</P>
              <P>(7) The conditions and limitations of use associated with the index listing have not been followed; or</P>
              <P>(8) Any information used to support the request for addition to the index contains any untrue statement of material fact.</P>
              <P>(b) The agency may partially remove an indexing listing if, in the opinion of the agency, such partial removal would satisfactorily resolve a safety or effectiveness issue otherwise warranting removal of the listing under section 572(f)(1)(B) of the act.</P>

              <P>(c) FDA may immediately suspend a new animal drug from the index if FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the use of the drug <PRTPAGE P="151"/>would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals. The agency will subsequently provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference as described in § 516.123.</P>
              <P>(d) A decision of FDA to remove a new animal drug from the index following an informal conference, if any, shall constitute final agency action subject to judicial review.</P>

              <P>(f) The following data and information in an index file are not available for public disclosure unless they have been previously disclosed to the public as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter, or they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they no <PRTPAGE P="152"/>longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in § 20.61 of this chapter:</P>
              <P>(1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and information, except that any compilation of such data and information aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or information which is not available for public disclosure under this provision is available for public disclosure.</P>

              <P>(g) Subject to the disclosure provisions of this section, the agency shall regard the contents of an index file as confidential information unless specifically notified in writing by the holder of the right to disclose, to reference, or otherwise utilize such information on behalf of another named person.</P>
              <P>(h) For purposes of this regulation, safety and effectiveness data include all studies and tests of an animal drug on animals and all studies and tests on the animal drug for identity, stability, purity, potency, and bioavailability.</P>
              <P>(i) Safety and effectiveness data and information that have not been previously disclosed to the public are available for public disclosure at the time any of the following events occurs unless extraordinary circumstances are shown:</P>

Only one application per season should be made for grub control and this will also provide initial control of lice. A second application for lice control may be made if animals become reinfested, but no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment. Proper timing of treatment is important for grub control; cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases.</P>

Cattle should not be slaughtered within 35 days following a single treatment. If a second application is made for lice control, cattle should not be slaughtered within 45 days of the second treatment. The drug must not be used within 28 days of freshening of dairy cattle. If freshening should occur within 28 days after treatment, do not use milk as human food for the balance of the 28-day interval. Do not treat lactating dairy cattle; calves less than 3 months old; or sick, convalescent, or stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, or dehorning or after exposure to contagious infectious diseases.</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Beef cattle and dairy cattle not of breeding age</E>—(i) <E T="03">Amount.</E> It is administered as a single, topical application placed on the backline of animals as follows: For animals weighing 150 to 300 pounds, apply 4 milliliters (mL); for animals weighing 301 to 600 pounds, apply 8 mL; for animals weighing 601 to 900 pounds, apply 12 mL; for animals weighing 901 to 1,200 pounds, apply 16 mL; and for animal weighing over 1,200 pounds, apply 20 mL. For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible after heel-fly activity ceases. A second application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for those which become reinfested. A second application should be made no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Indications for use.</E> For control of cattle grubs and as an aid in controlling lice on beef cattle and on dairy cattle not of breeding age.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitations.</E> Do not use on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Host-parasite reactions such as bloat, salivation, staggering and paralysis may sometimes occur when cattle are treated while the common cattle grub (<E T="03">Hypoderma lineatum</E>) is in the gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (<E T="03">H. bovis</E>) is in the area of the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of grub development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock specialist, or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment. If it is impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came and/or exact stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle receive only a maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the treatment period. This lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may occur in cattle on full feed when the common grub is killed while in the gullet. Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3 months old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, dehorning, or after exposure to contagious or infectious diseases. Do not slaughter within 45 days of treatment.</P>

Super phosphate is added to control the pH of the solution and ensure vat stability. Super phosphate is usually available at most fertilizer dealers as 0-45-0 or 0-46-0. Stir the dip thoroughly, preferably with a compressed air device; however, any form of thorough mixing is adequate. Re-stir vat contents prior to <PRTPAGE P="374"/>each use. During the dipping operation, each time the dip's volume is reduced by <FR>1/8</FR> to <FR>1/4</FR> of its initial volume, replenish with water and add the drug at a rate of 1 gallon for each 50 or 200 gallons water added—depending on dilution rate 1:60 or 1:240. Also add super phosphate as necessary to maintain pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Stir well and resume dipping. Repeat replenishment process as necessary. For evaportion, add additional water accordingly. For added water due to rainfall, merely replenish dip with the product according to directions. If overflow occurs, either analyze for drug concentration and adjust accordingly or dispose of vat contents and recharge. Check pH after each addition of water or super phosphate to assure proper pH controls.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Dip maintenance.</E> (<E T="03">1</E>) With use of dip vat tester, dipping may continue as long as the drug concentration is maintained between 0.15 and 0.25 percent, and the dip is not too foul for satisfactory use as indicated by foul odor or excessive darkening (i.e., color changes from beige to very dark brown).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Without use of dip vat tester, vat should be emptied, cleaned, and recharged each time one of the following occurs: When the dip has been charged for 120 days; when the dip becomes too foul for satisfactory use, within the 120-day limit; if the number of animals dipped equals twice the number of gallons of the initial dip volume, within the 120-day limit.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Spray method.</E> To prepare the spray, mix drug with water according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. Apply to the point of “runoff,” about 1 gallon of diluted spray per adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Pour-on method.</E> Dilute the drug with water according to table by slowly adding water to the product while stirring. Apply 1 ounce of the diluted mixture per 100 pounds of body weight (to a maximum of 8 ounces per head) down the center line of the back.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Timing of applications for cattle grub control.</E> For optimum cattle grub control, it is important to treat as soon as possible after the heel fly season, before the grub larvae reach the gullet or spinal canal, as the rapid kill of large numbers of larvae in these tissues may cause toxic side effects, such as bloat, salivation, staggering, and paralysis.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Treatment regimens.</E> (i) Control of scabies mites requires two treatments, 10 to 14 days apart.</P>
              <P>(ii) Control of Lone Star Ticks and hornflies requires two treatments, 7 days apart.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Warnings.</E> The drug is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Do not use this drug on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Do not apply within 21 days of slaughter. For use on beef cattle only. Do not treat sick, convalescent, or stressed cattle, or calves less than 3 months old except in Federal or State eradication programs where immediate treatment of all animals in an infested herd is mandatory. Be sure free access to drinking water is available to cattle prior to dipping. Do not dip excessively thirsty animals. Do not dip animals when overheated. Repeat treatment as necessary but not more often than every 7 to 10 days. Treatment for lice, ticks, hornflies, and scabies mites may be made any time of the year except when cattle grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Treatment for lice, ticks, and scabies mites may be made any time 7 to 10 days following treatment for grubs. Do not treat grubs when the grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe spray mist. Wear rubber gloves, goggles, and protective clothing. In case of skin contact, wash immediately with soap and water; for eyes, flush with water. Wash all contaminated clothing with soap and hot water before re-use.</P>

              <P>The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Extralabel use</E> means actual use or intended use of a drug in an animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed in the labeling, use at <PRTPAGE P="392"/>dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time based on these different uses.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">FDA</E> means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(c) The phrase <E T="03">a reasonable probability that a drug's use may present a risk to the public health</E> means that FDA has reason to believe that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse event.</P>
              <P>(d) The phrase <E T="03">use of a drug may present a risk to the public health</E> means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug may cause an adverse event.</P>
              <P>(e) The phrase <E T="03">use of a drug presents a risk to the public health</E> means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug has caused or likely will cause an adverse event.</P>
              <P>(f) A <E T="03">residue</E> means any compound present in edible tissues that results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.</P>
              <P>(g) A <E T="03">safe level</E> is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from which the food is derived.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Veterinarian</E> means a person licensed by a State or Territory to practice veterinary medicine.</P>
              <P>(i) A <E T="03">valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship</E> is one in which:</P>
              <P>(1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need for medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of the veterinarian;</P>
              <P>(2) There is sufficient knowledge of the animal(s) by the veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of the medical condition of the animal(s); and</P>
              <P>(3) The practicing veterinarian is readily available for followup in case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. Such a relationship can exist only when the veterinarian has recently seen and is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by virtue of examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate and timely visits to the premises where the animal(s) are kept.</P>

              <P>(a) As a condition of extralabel use permitted under this part, to permit FDA to ascertain any extralabel use or intended extralabel use of drugs that the agency has determined may present a risk to the public health, veterinarians shall maintain the following records of extralabel uses. Such records shall be legible, documented in an accurate and timely manner, and be readily accessible to permit prompt retrieval of information. Such records shall be adequate to substantiate the identification of the animals and shall be maintained either as individual records or, in food animal practices, on a group, herd, flock, or per-client basis. Records shall be adequate to provide the following information:</P>
              <P>(1) The established name of the drug and its active ingredient, or if formulated from more than one ingredient, the established name of each ingredient;</P>
              <P>(2) The condition treated;</P>
              <P>(3) The species of the treated animal(s);</P>
              <P>(4) The dosage administered;</P>
              <P>(5) The duration of treatment;</P>
              <P>(6) The numbers of animals treated; and</P>

              <P>(7) The specified withdrawal, withholding, or discard time(s), if applicable, for meat, milk, eggs, or any food which might be derived from any food animals treated.<PRTPAGE P="393"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) A veterinarian shall keep all required records for 2 years or as otherwise required by Federal or State law, whichever is greater.</P>
              <P>(c) Any person who is in charge, control, or custody of such records shall, upon request of a person designated by FDA, permit such person designated by FDA to, at all reasonable times, have access to, permit copying, and verify such records.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in food-producing animals.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an approved new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the agency finds, after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:</P>
              <P>(1) An acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA or that such method cannot be established; or</P>
              <P>(2) The extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health.</P>

              <P>(b) After making a determination that the analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed and submitted, or that such method cannot be established, or that an <PRTPAGE P="396"/>extralabel use in animals of a particular human drug or animal drug presents a risk to the public health, FDA will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> with a 90-day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition for an extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order shall state that an acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA; that such method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health; and shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and the reasons for the prohibition;</P>
              <P>(2) Request public comments; and</P>
              <P>(3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.</P>

              <P>(c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> prior to that date, that revokes the order of prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.</P>
              <P>(d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph (b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such action.</P>
              <P>(e) If FDA publishes a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> modifying an order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the original order of prohibition.</P>
              <P>(f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals will be codified in § 530.41.</P>

              <P>(g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an appropriate notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> remove a drug from the list of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or may modify a prohibition.</P>
              <P>(h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals without establishing a safe level.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Scope.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires an applicant seeking approval or conditional approval of a new animal drug to submit a proposed tolerance as part of its new animal drug application when such a tolerance is needed to assure that the proposed use of the new animal drug will be safe (see sections 512(b)(1)(H) and 571(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). FDA assigns tolerances for animal drugs used in food-producing animals as part of the application approval process. Tolerances for approved and conditionally approved new animal drugs are codified in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) Compounds that have been found to be carcinogenic are regulated under subpart E of part 500 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>
                <E T="03">Acceptable daily intake (ADI)</E> means the daily intake which, during up to an entire life of a human, appears to be without adverse effects or harm to the health of the consumer. The ADI most often will be set on the basis of the drug's toxicological, microbiological, or pharmacological properties. It is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams of the chemical per kilogram of body weight per day.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Acute reference dose (ARfD)</E> means an estimate of the amount of residues expressed on a body weight basis that can be ingested in a period of 24 hours or less without adverse effects or harm to the health of the human consumer.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Edible tissues</E> means muscle, liver, kidney, fat, skin with fat in natural proportions, whole eggs, whole milk, and honey.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Marker residue</E> means the residue whose concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of total residue in an edible tissue.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">mg/kg</E> means milligrams per kilogram.</P>
              <P>

              <P>(a) The tolerances listed in subpart B of this part pertain only to the species and production classes of the animal for which the drug use has been approved or conditionally approved. Approved and conditionally approved conditions of use in parts 516, 520, 522, 524, 526, 529, and 558 of this chapter, including the species and production classes of animals, are referenced in each tolerance section in subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) All tolerances refer to the concentrations of a marker residue, or other residue indicated for monitoring, permitted in uncooked tissues.</P>
              <P>(c) After a tolerance is listed, the finding that the concentration of the marker residue in the target tissue from a tested animal is at or below the tolerance indicates that all edible tissues (excluding milk and eggs unless otherwise indicated) from that tested animal are safe for human consumption. If a listed tolerance is not expressly linked to a target tissue, then the tolerance is specific only for the named edible tissue and inferences cannot be made about the safety of the other edible tissues from the tested animal.</P>

              <P>(d) FDA requires that a drug sponsor submit a practicable method as part of their new animal drug application. FDA uses the practicable method to determine the quantity of the drug residues that can safely remain in edible tissues (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the tolerance), the withdrawal period, and any other use restrictions necessary to ensure that the proposed use of the drug will be safe.</P>

            <SECTION>
              <SECTNO>§ 558.3</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Definitions and general considerations applicable to this part.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Regulations in this part provide for approved uses of drugs and combinations of drugs in animal feeds. Approved combinations of such drugs are specifically identified or incorporated by cross-reference. Unless specifically provided for by the regulations, a combination of two or more drugs is not approved.</P>
              <P>(b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:</P>
              <P>(1) New animal drugs approved for use in animal feed are placed in two categories as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Category I—These drugs require no withdrawal period at the lowest use level in each major species for which they are approved or are approved for use only in minor species.</P>
              <P>(ii) Category II—These drugs require a withdrawal period at the lowest use level for at least one major species for which they are approved, or are regulated on a “no-residue” basis or with a zero tolerance because of carcinogenic concern regardless of whether a withdrawal period is required in any species.</P>
              <P>(2) A “Type A medicated article” is intended solely for use in the manufacture of another Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C medicated feed. It consists of a new animal drug(s), with or without carrier (e.g., calcium carbonate, rice hull, corn, gluten) with or without inactive ingredients. The manufacture of a Type A medicated article requires an application approved under § 514.105 of this chapter or an index listing granted under § 516.151 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(3) A “Type B medicated feed” is intended solely for the manufacture of other medicated feeds (Type B or Type C). It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins and/or minerals and/or other nutritional ingredients in an amount not less than 25 percent of the weight. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or another Type B medicated feed. The maximum concentration of animal drug(s) in a Type B medicated feed is 200 times the highest continuous use level for Category I drugs and 100 times the highest continuous use level for Category II drugs. The term “highest continuous use level” means the highest dosage at which the drug is approved for continuous use (14 days or more), or, if the drug is not approved for continuous use, it means the highest level used for disease prevention or control. If the drug is approved for multiple species at different use levels, the highest approved level of use would govern under this definition. The manufacture of a Type B medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill license application approved under § 515.20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) A “Type C medicated feed” is intended as the complete feed for the animal or may be fed “top dressed” (added on top of usual ration) on or offered “free-choice” (e.g., supplement) in conjunction with other animal feed. It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional ingredients. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or a Type B medicated feed. A Type C medicated feed may be further diluted to produce another Type C medicated feed. The manufacture of a Type C medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill license application approved under § 515.20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(5) A Type B or Type C medicated feed manufactured from a drug component (bulk or “drum-run” (dried crude fermentation product)) requires an application approved under § 514.105 of this chapter or an index listing granted under § 516.151 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(6) A “veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug” is a drug intended for use in or on animal feed which is limited by an approved application filed pursuant to section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a conditionally approved application filed pursuant to section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or an index listing under section 572 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to use under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian. Use of <PRTPAGE P="414"/>animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug must be authorized by a lawful veterinary feed directive.</P>
              <P>(7) A “veterinary feed directive” is a written (nonverbal) statement issued by a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice that orders the use of a VFD drug or combination VFD drug in or on an animal feed. This written statement authorizes the client (the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) to obtain and use animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug or combination VFD drug to treat the client's animals only in accordance with the conditions for use approved, conditionally approved, or indexed by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(8) A “medicated feed” means a Type B medicated feed as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section or a Type C medicated feed as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9) For the purposes of this part, a “distributor” means any person who distributes a medicated feed containing a VFD drug to another person. Such other person may be another distributor or the client-recipient of a VFD.</P>
              <P>(10) An “animal production facility” is a location where animals are raised for any purpose, but does not include the specific location where medicated feed is made.</P>
              <P>(11) An “acknowledgment letter” is a written (nonverbal) communication provided to a distributor (consignor) from another distributor (consignee). An acknowledgment letter must be provided either in hardcopy or through electronic media and must affirm:</P>
              <P>(i) That the distributor will not ship such VFD feed to an animal production facility that does not have a VFD,</P>
              <P>(ii) That the distributor will not ship such VFD feed to another distributor without receiving a similar written acknowledgment letter, and</P>
              <P>(iii) That the distributor has complied with the distributor notification requirements of § 558.6(c)(5).</P>
              <P>(12) A “combination veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug” is a combination new animal drug (as defined in § 514.4(c)(1)(i) of this chapter) intended for use in or on animal feed which is limited by an approved application filed under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a conditionally approved application filed under section 571 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or an index listing under section 572 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to use under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian, and at least one of the new animal drugs in the combination is a VFD drug. Use of animal feed bearing or containing a combination VFD drug must be authorized by a lawful VFD.</P>
              <P>(13) “Major species” means cattle, horses, swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats.</P>
              <P>(14) “Minor species” means animals, other than humans, that are not major species.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Veterinary feed directive drugs.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements related to veterinary feed directive (VFD) drugs.</E> (1) Animal feed bearing or containing a VFD drug or a combination VFD drug (a VFD feed or combination VFD feed) may be fed to animals only by or upon a lawful VFD issued by a licensed veterinarian.</P>
              <P>(2) A VFD feed or combination VFD feed must not be fed to animals after the expiration date on the VFD.</P>
              <P>(3) Use and labeling of a VFD drug or a combination VFD drug in feed is limited to the approved, conditionally approved, or indexed conditions of use. Use of feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug in a manner other than as directed on the labeling (extralabel use) is not permitted.</P>

              <P>(4) All involved parties (the veterinarian, the distributor, and the client) must retain a copy of the VFD for 2 <PRTPAGE P="418"/>years. The veterinarian must retain the original VFD in its original form (electronic or hardcopy). The distributor and client copies may be kept as an electronic copy or hardcopy.</P>
              <P>(5) All involved parties must make the VFD and any other records specified in this section available for inspection and copying by FDA upon request.</P>
              <P>(6) All labeling and advertising for VFD drugs, combination VFD drugs, and feeds containing VFD drugs or combination VFD drugs must prominently and conspicuously display the following cautionary statement: “Caution: Federal law restricts medicated feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.”</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Responsibilities of the veterinarian issuing the VFD.</E> (1) In order for a VFD to be lawful, the veterinarian issuing the VFD must:</P>
              <P>(i) Be licensed to practice veterinary medicine; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Be operating in the course of the veterinarian's professional practice and in compliance with all applicable veterinary licensing and practice requirements, including issuing the VFD in the context of a veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) as defined by the State. If applicable VCPR requirements as defined by such State do not include the key elements of a valid VCPR as defined in § 530.3(i) of this chapter, the veterinarian must issue the VFD in the context of a valid VCPR as defined in § 530.3(i) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) The veterinarian must only issue a VFD that is in compliance with the conditions for use approved, conditionally approved, or indexed for the VFD drug or combination VFD drug.</P>
              <P>(3) The veterinarian must ensure that the following information is fully and accurately included on the VFD:</P>
              <P>(i) The veterinarian's name, address, and telephone number;</P>
              <P>(ii) The client's name, business or home address, and telephone number;</P>
              <P>(iii) The premises at which the animals specified in the VFD are located;</P>
              <P>(iv) The date of VFD issuance;</P>
              <P>(v) The expiration date of the VFD. This date must not extend beyond the expiration date specified in the approval, conditional approval, or index listing, if such date is specified. In cases where the expiration date is not specified in the approval, conditional approval, or index listing, the expiration date of the VFD must not exceed 6 months after the date of issuance;</P>
              <P>(vi) The name of the VFD drug(s);</P>
              <P>(vii) The species and production class of animals to be fed the VFD feed;</P>
              <P>(viii) The approximate number of animals to be fed the VFD feed by the expiration date of the VFD. The approximate number of animals is the potential number of animals of the species and production class identified on the VFD that will be fed the VFD feed or combination VFD feed at the specified premises by the expiration date of the VFD;</P>

              <P>(ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.</P>
              <P>(2) A physically stable lasalocid liquid feed will not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section provided it has a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and contains a suspending agent(s) sufficient to maintain a viscosity of not less than 300 centipoises per second for 3 months.</P>
              <P>(3) If a manufacturer is unable to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the manufacturer may secure approval of a positionally stable liquid feed by:</P>
              <P>(i) Either filing a new animal drug application for the product or establishing a master file containing data to support the stability of its product;</P>

              <P>(iii) Requesting the sponsor of an approved new animal drug application to file a supplement to provide for use of its lasalocid Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the data demonstrate the stability of the liquid feed described in the master file, the supplemental new animal drug application will be approved. The approval will provide a basis for the individual liquid feed manufacturer to manufacture under a medicated feed license the liquid mediated feed described in the master file.

              <P>(i) For liquid Type B feed (cattle and sheep): Mix thoroughly with grain and/or roughage prior to feeding. Feeding undiluted, mixing errors, or inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) may result in an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of lasalocid for use in unapproved species has not been established.</P>
              <P>(ii) For Type A articles or Type B feeds (cattle and sheep): Feeding undiluted or mixing errors may result in an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal.

              <P>(d) <E T="03">Conditions of use.</E> (1) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle, use 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid Type C feed (1.65 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate protection.</P>
              <P>(2) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) bloat in cattle grazing of prebloom legumes, use 10.00 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid Type C feed (2.2 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.15 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate protection. If consumption exceeds 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily, cattle should be changed to a Type C feed containing 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound.</P>
              <P>(3) Poloxalene liquid Type A article must be thoroughly blended and evenly distributed into a liquid Type C feed and offered to cattle in a covered liquid Type C feed feeder with lick wheels. The formula for the liquid Type C feed, on a weight/weight basis, is as follows: Ammonium polyphosphate 2.66 percent, phosphoric acid (75 percent) 3.37 percent, sulfuric acid 1.00 percent, water 10.00 percent, and molasses sufficient to make 100.00 percent, vitamins A and D and/or trace minerals may be added. One free-turning lick wheel per 25 head of cattle must be provided.</P>
              <P>(4) The medicated liquid Type C feed must be introduced at least 2 to 5 days before legume consumption to accustom the cattle to the medicated liquid Type C feed and to lick wheel feedings. If the medicated liquid wheel Type C feed feeding is interrupted, this 2- to 5-day introductory feeding should be repeated.</P>

A decrease in dry matter intake may be noticed in some animals receiving lubabegron. Lubabegron has not been approved for use in breeding animals because safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated in these animals. Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing lubabegron and monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats. Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing.

L. 85-929, Sept. 6, 1958), these opinions were given pursuant to section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which reads in part: “A food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health”.</P>
              <P>(b) Since enactment of the Food Additives Amendment, the Food and Drug Administration has advised such inquirers that an article:</P>
              <P>(1) Is a food additive within the meaning of section 201(s) of the act; or</P>
              <P>(2) Is generally recognized as safe (GRAS); or</P>
              <P>(3) Has prior sanction or approval under that amendment; or</P>
              <P>(4) Is not a food additive under the conditions of intended use.</P>
              <P>(c) In the interest of the public health, such articles which have been considered in the past by the Food and Drug Administration to be safe under the provisions of section 402(a)(1), or to be generally recognized as safe for their intended use, or to have prior sanction or approval, or not to be food additives under the conditions of intended use, must be reexamined in the light of current scientific information and current principles for evaluating the safety of food additives if their use is to be continued.</P>
              <P>(d) Because of the time span involved, copies of many of the letters in which the Food and Drug Administration has expressed an informal opinion concerning the status of such articles may no longer be in the file of the Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of information concerning the names and uses made of all the articles referred to in such letters, their safety of use cannot be reexamined. For this reason all food additive status opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of this section given by the Food and Drug Administration are hereby revoked.</P>
              <P>(e) The prior opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of this section will be replaced by qualified and current opinions if the recipient of each such letter forwards a copy of each to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of Surveillance and Compliance (HFV-200), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, along with a copy of his letter of inquiry, on or before July 23, 1970.</P>
              <P>(f) This section does not apply to food additive status opinion letters pertaining to articles that were considered by the Food and Drug Administration to be food additives nor to articles included in regulations in this Subchapter E if the articles are used in accordance with the requirements of such regulations.</P>

              <P>When pesticide chemical residues occur in processed foods due to the use of raw agricultural commodities that bore or contained a pesticide chemical in conformity with an exemption granted or a tolerance prescribed under section 408 of the act, the processed food will not be regarded as adulterated so long as good manufacturing practice has been followed in removing any residue from the raw agricultural commodity in the processing (such as by peeling or washing) and so long as the concentration of the residue in the processed food when ready to eat is not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity. But when the concentration of residue in the processed food when ready to eat is higher than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, the processed food is adulterated unless the higher concentration is permitted by a tolerance obtained under section 409 of the act. For example, if fruit bearing a residue of 7 parts per million of DDT permitted on the raw agricultural commodity is dried and a residue in excess of 7 parts per million of DDT results on the dried fruit, the dehydrated fruit is adulterated unless the higher tolerance for DDT is authorized by the regulations in this part. Food that is itself ready to eat, and which contains a higher residue than allowed for the raw agricultural commodity, may not be legalized by blending or mixing with other foods to reduce the residue in the mixed food below the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.</P>

              <P>(a) In reaching a decision on any petition filed under section 409 of the act, the Commissioner will give full consideration to the specific biological properties of the compound and the adequacy of the methods employed to demonstrate safety for the proposed use, and the Commissioner will be guided by the principles and procedures for establishing the safety of food additives stated in current publications of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A petition will not be denied, however, by reason of the petitioner's having followed procedures other than those outlined in the publications of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council if, from available evidence, the Commissioner finds that the procedures used give results as reliable as, or more reliable than, those reasonably to be expected from the use of the outlined procedures. In reaching a decision, the Commissioner will give due weight to the anticipated levels and patterns of consumption of the additive specified or reasonably inferable. For the purposes of this section, the principles for evaluating safety of additives set forth in the above-mentioned publications will apply to any substance that may properly be classified as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act.</P>
              <P>(b) Upon written request describing the proposed use of an additive and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner will advise a person who wishes to establish the safety of a food additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield data adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the additive.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) General recognition of safety may be based only on the views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. The basis of such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food. General recognition of safety requires common knowledge throughout the scientific community knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful to either the target animal or to humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals under the conditions of its intended use (see § 570.3(i)).<PRTPAGE P="538"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures shall require the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures shall address safety for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals and shall be based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data, information, or methods, which ordinarily are published, as well as the application of scientific principles, and may be corroborated by the application of unpublished scientific data, information, or methods.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall address safety for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals and may be achieved without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a food additive. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall be based solely on food use of the substance in the same animal species prior to January 1, 1958, and shall ordinarily be based upon generally available data and information. An ingredient not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific procedures.</P>
              <P>(2) A substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, may be generally recognized as safe through experience based on its common use in food when that use occurred exclusively or primarily outside of the United States if the information about the experience establishes that the substance is safe under the conditions of its intended use within the meaning of section 201(u) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see also § 570.3(i)) for both the target animal and for humans consuming human food derived from food-producing animals. Common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, that occurred outside of the United States shall be documented by published or other information and shall be corroborated by information from a second, independent source that confirms the history and circumstances of use of the substance. The information used to document and to corroborate the history and circumstances of use of the substance must be generally available; that is, it must be widely available in the country in which the history of use has occurred and readily available to interested qualified experts in the United States. A person who concludes that a use of a substance is GRAS through experience based on its common use in food outside of the United States should notify FDA of that view in accordance with subpart E of this part.</P>
              <P>(d) The food ingredients listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter or affirmed as GRAS in part 584 of this chapter do not include all substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use in food. Because of the large number of substances the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in their becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food, it is impracticable to list all such substances that are GRAS. A food ingredient of natural biological origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the United States prior to January 1, 1958, without known detrimental effects, which is subject only to conventional processing as practiced prior to January 1, 1958, and for which no known safety hazard exists, will ordinarily be regarded as GRAS without specific inclusion in part 582 or part 584 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) A food ingredient that is not GRAS or subject to a prior sanction requires a food additive regulation promulgated under section 409 of the act before it may be directly or indirectly added to food.</P>
              <P>(f) A food ingredient that is listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter shall be regarded as GRAS only if, in addition to all the requirements in the applicable regulation, it also meets all of the following requirements:</P>

              <P>(1) It complies with any applicable specifications, or in the absence of such specifications, shall be of a purity suitable for its intended use.<PRTPAGE P="539"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) It performs an appropriate function in the food or food-contact article in which it is used.</P>
              <P>(3) It is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that food or, if used as a component of a food-contact article, at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that article.</P>
              <P>(g) New information may at any time require reconsideration of the GRAS status of a food ingredient. Any change in status shall be accomplished pursuant to § 570.38.</P>
              <P>(h) If a substance is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to § 570.35 and listed in a regulation with no limitation other than good manufacturing practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use are not significantly different from those reported in the regulation as the basis on which the GRAS status of the substance was affirmed. If the conditions of use are significantly different, such use of the substance may not be GRAS. In such case a manufacturer may not rely on the regulation as authorizing the use but must independently establish that the use is GRAS or must use the substance in accordance with a food additive regulation.</P>
              <P>(i) If an ingredient is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to § 570.35 and listed in a regulation with specific limitation(s), it may be used in food only within such limitation(s) (including the category of food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of use). Any use of such an ingredient not in full compliance with each such established limitation shall require a food additive regulation.</P>
              <P>(j) Pursuant to § 570.35, a food ingredient may be affirmed as GRAS and listed in a regulation for a specific use(s) without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient. In addition to the use(s) specified in the regulation, other uses of such an ingredient may also be GRAS. Any affirmation of GRAS status for a specific use(s), without a general evaluation of use of the ingredient, is subject to reconsideration upon such evaluation.</P>

              <P>(d) If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is aware of any prior sanction for use of the substance, he will concurrently propose a separate regulation covering such use of the ingredient under this subchapter E. If the Commissioner is unaware of any such applicable prior sanction, the proposed regulation will so state and will require any person who intends to assert or rely on such sanction to submit proof of its existence. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in adulteration of the food in violation of section 402 of the act, and the failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a waiver of the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time. The notice will also constitute a proposal to establish a regulation under this subchapter E., incorporating the same provisions, in the event that such a regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the proposal.</P>

                <P>Attached hereto, in triplicate, and constituting a part of this petition, are the following:</P>
                <P>A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the food additive, including chemical identity and composition of the food additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and specifications prescribing the minimum content of the desired component(s) and identifying and limiting the reaction byproducts and other impurities. Where such information is not available, a statement as to the reasons why it is not should be submitted.</P>
                <P>When the chemical identity and composition of the food additive is not known, the petition shall contain information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation regarding the method of manufacture and the analytical controls used during the various stages of manufacturing, processing, or packing of the food additive which are relied upon to establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls within reasonable limits that do not affect the characteristics of the substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified.</P>
                <P>If the food additive is a mixture of chemicals, the petition shall supply a list of all substances used in the synthesis, extraction, or other method of preparation, regardless of whether they undergo chemical change in the process. Each substance should be identified by its common English name and complete chemical name, using structural formulas when necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is used as a component, the proprietary name should be followed by a complete quantitative statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives for any listed substance may be specified.</P>
                <P>If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, processing, and packing operations for a food additive, the petition shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations and designate the part.</P>
                <P>The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate that it is needed to ensure the identity, strength, quality, or purity of the additive, the expiration date that will be employed.</P>
                <P>B. The amount of the food additive proposed for use and the purposes for which it is proposed, together with all directions, recommendations, and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as specimens of the labeling proposed for the food additive and any labeling that will be required by applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act on the finished food by reason of the use of the food additive. If the additive results or may reasonably be expected to result from the use of packaging material, the petitioner shall show how this may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.</P>
                <P>(Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for consideration of the petition, provided a statement is made that final printed labeling identical in content to the draft copy will be submitted as soon as available and prior to the marketing of the food additive.</P>
                <P>If the food additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may support a higher tolerance.)</P>
                <P>C. Data establishing that the food additive will have the intended physical or other technical effect or that it may reasonably be expected to become a component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of food and the amount necessary to accomplish this. These data should include information in sufficient detail to permit evaluation with control data.</P>

                <P>D. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of the food additive in the raw, processed, and/or finished food and of any substance formed in or on such food because of its use. The test proposed shall be one that can be used for food-control purposes and that can be applied with consistent results by any properly equipped and trained laboratory personnel.<PRTPAGE P="547"/>
                </P>
                <P>E. Full reports of investigations made with respect to the safety of the food additive.</P>
                <P>(A petition may be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not the food additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit without explanation any reports of investigations that would bias an evaluation of the safety of the food additive.)</P>
                <P>F. Proposed tolerances for the food additive, if tolerances are required in order to ensure its safety. A petitioner may include a proposed regulation.</P>
                <P>G. If submitting petition to modify an existing regulation issued pursuant to section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, full information on each proposed change that is to be made in the original regulation must be submitted. The petition may omit statements made in the original petition concerning which no change is proposed. A supplemental petition must be submitted for any change beyond the variations provided for in the original petition and the regulation issued on the basis of the original petition.</P>
                <P>H. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(4) For purposes of this regulation, safety and functionality data include all studies and tests of a food additive on animals and humans and all studies and tests on a food additive for identity, stability, purity, potency, performance, and usefulness.</P>
              <P>(i)(1) Within 15 days after receipt, the Commissioner will notify the petitioner of acceptance or nonacceptance of a petition, and if not accepted the reasons therefor. If accepted, the date of the notification letter sent to petitioner becomes the date of filing for the purposes of section 409(b)(5) of the act. If the petitioner desires, he may supplement a deficient petition after being notified regarding deficiencies. If the supplementary material or explanation of the petition is deemed acceptable, petitioner shall be notified. The date of such notification becomes the date of filing. If the petitioner does not wish to supplement or explain the petition and requests in writing that it be filed as submitted, the petition shall be filed and the petitioner so notified. The date of such notification becomes the date of filing.</P>
              <P>(2) The Commissioner will publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> within 30 days from the date of filing of such petition, a notice of the filing, the name of the petitioner, and a brief description of the proposal in general terms. In the case of a food additive which becomes a component of food by migration from packaging material, the notice shall include the name of the migratory substance, and where it is different from that of one of the original components, the name of the parent component, the maximum quantity of the migratory substance that is proposed for use in food, and the physical or other technical effect which the migratory substance or its parent component is intended to have in the packaging material. A copy of the notice will be mailed to the petitioner when the original is forwarded to the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for publication.</P>
              <P>(j) The Commissioner may request a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the production of the food additive, or a sample of the food additive, articles used as components thereof, or of the food in which the additive is proposed to be used, at any time while a petition is under consideration. The Commissioner shall specify in the request for a sample of the food additive, or articles used as components thereof, or of the food in or on which the additive is proposed to be used, a quantity deemed adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to determine quantities of the food additive present in foods for which it is intended to be used or adequate for any study or investigation reasonably required with respect to the safety of the food additive or the physical or technical effect it produces. The date used for computing the 90-day limit for the purposes of section 409(c)(2) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day for each day after the mailing date of the request taken by the petitioner to submit the sample. If the information or sample is requested a reasonable time in advance of the 180 days, but is not submitted within such 180 days after filing of the petition, the petition will be considered withdrawn without prejudice.</P>

              <P>(k) If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, petitions filed with the <PRTPAGE P="549"/>Commissioner under section 409(b) of the act shall include, with respect to each study, either a statement that the study was conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.</P>

              <P>(2) Feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated to account for nutritional loss.</P>
              <P>(3) If an irradiated feed ingredient is less than 5 percent of the final product, the final product can be irradiated without being considered to be reirradiated.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Substances that are generally recognized as safe.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) It is impracticable to list all substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use. However, by way of illustration, the Commissioner regards such common food ingredients as salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, baking powder, and monosodium glutamate as safe for their intended use. The lists in subparts B through H of this part include additional substances that, when used for the purposes indicated, in accordance with good manufacturing or feeding practice, are regarded by the Commissioner as generally recognized as safe for such uses.</P>
              <P>(b) For the purposes of this section, good manufacturing or feeding practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions:</P>
              <P>(1) The quantity of a substance added to animal food does not exceed the amount reasonably required to accomplish its intended physical, nutritional, or other technical effect in food; and</P>
              <P>(2) The quantity of a substance that becomes a component of animal food as a result of its use in the manufacturing, processing, or packaging of food, and which is not intended to accomplish any physical or other technical effect in the food itself, shall be reduced to the extent reasonably possible.</P>
              <P>(3) The substance is of appropriate grade and is prepared and handled as a food ingredient. Upon request the Commissioner will offer an opinion, based on specifications and intended use, as to whether or not a particular grade or lot of the substance is of suitable purity for use in food and would generally be regarded as safe for the purpose intended, by experts qualified to evaluate its safety.</P>
              <P>(c) The inclusion of substances in the list of nutrients does not constitute a finding on the part of the Department that the substance is useful as a supplement to the diet for animals.</P>

              <P>(d) Substances that are generally recognized as safe for their intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Act are listed in subparts B through H of this part. When the status <PRTPAGE P="580"/>of a substance has been reevaluated and affirmed as GRAS or deleted from subparts B through H of this part, an appropriate explanation will be noted, e.g., “affirmed as GRAS,” “food additive regulation,” “interim food additive regulation,” or “prohibited from use in food,” with a reference to the appropriate new regulation. Such notation will apply only to the specific use covered by the review, e.g., direct animal food use and/or indirect animal food use and/or animal feed use and will not affect its status for other uses not specified in the referenced regulation, pending a specific review of such other uses.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(1) <E T="03">Protein derived from mammalian tissues</E> means any protein-containing portion of mammalian animals, excluding: Blood and blood products; gelatin; tallow containing no more than 0.15 percent insoluble impurities and tallow derivatives as specified in § 589.2001; inspected meat products which have been cooked and offered for human food and further heat processed for feed (such as plate waste and used cellulosic food casings); milk products (milk and milk proteins); and any product whose only mammalian protein consists entirely of porcine or equine protein.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Renderer</E> means any firm or individual that processes slaughter byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as defined here) whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Blender</E> means any firm or individual which obtains processed animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein product.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Feed manufacturer</E> includes manufacturers of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals, and includes on-farm in addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and mixing operations.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Nonmammalian protein</E> includes proteins from nonmammalian animals.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Distributor</E> includes persons who distribute or transport feeds or feed ingredients intended for animals.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Ruminant</E> includes any member of the order of animals which has a stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) through which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Food additive status.</E> The Food and Drug Administration has determined that protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The use or intended use in ruminant feed of any material that contains protein derived from mammalian tissues causes the feed to be adulterated and in violation of the act, unless it is the subject of an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food additive under § 570.17 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section.</E> (1) Renderers that manufacture products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues and that are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following measures to ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this section are not used in the feed of ruminants:</P>

              <P>(ii) Maintain records sufficient to track the materials throughout their receipt, processing, and distribution, and make the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they:</P>
              <P>(i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and whose design has been made available to the public;</P>

              <P>(ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration to detect the presence of the agent that causes TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. Renderers whose products test positive for agents that cause TSE's must comply with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this <PRTPAGE P="605"/>section. Records of the test results shall be made available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or</P>
              <P>(iii) Use exclusively a method for controlling the manufacturing process that minimizes the risk of the TSE agent entering the product and whose design has been made available to the public and validated by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to make a mark indicating that the product contains or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissue. If the marking is by the use of an agent that cannot be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must use an agent whose presence can be detected by a method that has been validated by the Food and Drug Administration and whose design has been made available to the public.</P>
              <P>(4) Renderers shall comply with all applicable requirements under § 589.2001.</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Mechanically separated beef</E> means a finely comminuted meat food product, resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of the bone from attached skeletal muscle of cattle carcasses and parts of carcasses.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Renderer</E> means any firm or individual that processes slaughter byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as defined in this paragraph) whose intended use for the products may include animal feed, industrial use, or other uses. The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Tallow</E> means the rendered fat of cattle obtained by pressing or by applying any other extraction process to tissues derived directly from discrete adipose tissue masses or to other carcass parts and tissues.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Tallow derivative</E> means any product obtained through initial hydrolysis, saponification, or trans-esterification of tallow; chemical conversion of material obtained by hydrolysis, saponification, or trans-esterification may be applied to obtain the desired product.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) No animal feed or feed ingredient shall be manufactured from, processed with, or otherwise contain, cattle materials prohibited in animal feed as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Renderers that receive, manufacture, process, blend, or distribute cattle materials prohibited in animal feed as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or products that contain or may contain cattle materials prohibited in animal feed, shall take the following measures to ensure that materials prohibited as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not introduced into animal feed:</P>
              <P>(i) Exclude from use in animal feed the entire carcass of cattle not inspected and passed for human consumption as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section if:</P>
              <P>(A) The brain and spinal cord are not effectively removed from such cattle or the brain and spinal cord from such cattle are not otherwise effectively excluded from animal feed; and</P>
              <P>(B) Such cattle are 30 months of age or older.</P>

              <P>(ii) If renderers remove brain and spinal cord from cattle not inspected and passed for human consumption, or separate such animals based on whether or not they are 30 months of age or older, renderers must maintain adequate written procedures specifying how these processes are carried out.<PRTPAGE P="608"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) Once cattle materials prohibited in animal feed have been separated from other cattle materials, provide for measures to avoid cross-contamination;</P>
              <P>(A) Use separate equipment while handling cattle materials prohibited in animal feed; or</P>
              <P>(B) Use separate containers that adequately prevent contact with animal feed, animal feed ingredients, or equipment surfaces;</P>
              <P>(iv) Label the cattle materials prohibited in animal feed and products that contain or may contain cattle materials prohibited in animal feed in a conspicuous manner as follows: “Do not feed to animals”;</P>

              <P>(vi) Establish and maintain records sufficient to track cattle materials prohibited in animal feed to ensure such material is not introduced into animal feed, and make the records available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(3) Renderers that receive, manufacture, process, blend, or distribute any cattle materials shall take the following measures to ensure that materials prohibited as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not used in animal feed:</P>
              <P>(i) Establish and maintain records sufficient to demonstrate that material rendered for use in animal feed was not manufactured from, processed with, or does not otherwise contain, cattle materials prohibited in animal feed and make copies of all records available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. With respect to cattle materials obtained from establishments which have segregated cattle materials prohibited in animal feed, such records must demonstrate that establishments supplying cattle materials to the renderers have adequate procedures in place to effectively exclude cattle materials prohibited in animal feed; and these records shall be considered sufficient to meet this requirement if they include either:</P>
              <P>(A) Certification or other documentation from the supplier that material supplied to the renderer does not include cattle materials prohibited in animal feed; such certification or documentation is acceptable, provided that it includes a description of the segregation procedures used, documentation that the supplier confirms that its segregation procedures are in place prior to supplying any cattle material to the renderer, and records of the renderer's periodic review of the suppliers' certification or other documentation; or</P>
              <P>(B) Documentation of another method acceptable to FDA, such as third-party certification, for verifying that suppliers have effectively excluded cattle materials prohibited in animal feed.</P>
              <P>(ii) Comply with all applicable requirements under § 589.2000 regarding animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Adulteration and misbranding.</E> (1) Failure of a renderer to comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi), or (c)(3)(i) of this section will render the animal feed or feed ingredients adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</P>
              <P>(2) Animal feed or feed ingredients that are not in compliance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section are adulterated under section 402(a)(2), 402(a)(3), or 402(a)(5) of the act.</P>
              <P>(3) Animal feed or feed ingredients that are not in compliance with the labeling requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are misbranded under section 403(a)(1) or 403(f) of the act.</P>
              <P>(4) Failure of a renderer to comply with the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section will render the animal feed or feed ingredients adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Inspection; records retention.</E> Records required to be made available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration, as required by this section, shall be kept for a minimum of 1 year.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Process for designating countries.</E> A country seeking designation must send a written request to the Director, Office of the Center Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, at the address <PRTPAGE P="609"/>designated in § 5.1100 of this chapter. The request shall include information about that country's BSE case history, risk factors, measures to prevent the introduction and transmission of BSE, and any other information relevant to determining whether the cattle materials from the requesting country do or do not meet the definitions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. FDA shall respond in writing to any such request and may impose conditions in granting any such request. Any grant by FDA of such a request under this paragraph will be subject to future review by FDA and may be revoked if FDA determines that the granted request is no longer appropriate.</P>
