      <HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>
      <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>
      <P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>
      <IPAR>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>
        <STUB>as of January 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>
        <STUB>as of April 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>
        <STUB>as of July 1</STUB>
        <P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>
        <STUB>as of October 1</STUB>
      </IPAR>
      <P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>
        <P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>
        <P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>
        <P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2020), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>
        <P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>

        <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. <PRTPAGE P="vi"/>Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.</P>
      </SIDEHED>
      <SIDEHED>
        <HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>
        <P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>
        <P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E> Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E> The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</P>
        <P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</P>
        <P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>
        <P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>
        <P>
          <E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E> If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Petitions requesting exemption from preemption for State or local requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Scope and purpose.</E> (1) This subpart applies to the submission and consideration of petitions under section 403A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), by a State or a political subdivision of a State, requesting exemption of a State requirement from preemption under section 403A(a) of the act.</P>
              <P>(2) Section 403A(b) of the act provides that where a State requirement has been preempted under section 403A(a) of the act, the State may petition the agency for an exemption. The agency may grant the exemption, under such conditions as it may prescribe by regulation, if the agency finds that the State requirement will not cause any food to be in violation of any applicable requirement under Federal law, will not unduly burden interstate commerce, and is designed to address a particular need for information that is not met by the preemptive Federal requirement.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (1) <E T="03">Act</E> means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 <E T="03">et seq.</E>).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Agency</E> means the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Commissioner</E> means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">State</E> means a State as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the act (which includes a territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) or any political subdivision of a State having authority to issue food standards and food labeling regulations having force of law.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">State requirement</E> means any statute, standard, regulation, or other requirement that is issued by a State.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Prerequisites for petitions for exemption from preemption.</E> The Food and Drug Administration will consider a petition for exemption from preemption on its merits only if the petition demonstrates that:</P>
              <P>(1) The State requirement was enacted or was issued as a final rule by an authorized official of the State and is in effect or would be in effect but for the provisions of section 403A of the act.</P>
              <P>(2) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because of a statutory provision listed in that section or because of a Federal standard or other Federal regulation that is in effect, or that has been published as a final rule with a designated effective date, and that was issued under the authority of a statutory provision listed in that section. For the purposes of this subpart, all petitions seeking exemption from preemption under section 403A(a)(3) through (a)(5) of the act submitted before May 8, 1992, will be considered timely even though the applicable statutory provisions or regulations are not yet in effect.</P>

              <P>(3) The petitioner is an official of a State having authority to act for, or on behalf of, the Government in applying for an exemption of State requirements from preemption.<PRTPAGE P="6"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because it is not identical to the requirement of the preemptive Federal statutory provision or regulation including a standard of identity, quality, and fill. “Not identical to” does not refer to the specific words in the requirement but instead means that the State requirement directly or indirectly imposes obligations or contains provisions concerning the composition or labeling of food, or concerning a food container, that:</P>
              <P>(i) Are not imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Differ from those specifically imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Form of petition.</E> (1) All information included in the petition should meet the general requirements of § 10.20(c) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) An original and one copy of the petition shall be submitted, or the petitioner may submit an original and a computer readable disk containing the petition. Contents of the disk should be in a standard format, such as ASCII format. (Petitioners interested in submitting a disk should contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition for details.)</P>

              <P>(3) Petitions for exemption from preemption for a State requirement shall be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management in the following form:

              <SUBJECT>Misleading containers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>In accordance with section 403(d) of the act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading.</P>
              <P>(a) A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill. Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled to less than its capacity for reasons other than:</P>
              <P>(1) Protection of the contents of the package;</P>
              <P>(2) The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;</P>
              <P>(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;</P>
              <P>(4) The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;</P>
              <P>(5) The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or</P>
              <P>(6) Inability to increase level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).</P>

              <P>(a) For the purposes of this section, the term <E T="03">iodized salt</E> or <E T="03">iodized table salt</E> is designated as the name of salt for human food use to which iodide has been added in the form of cuprous iodide or potassium iodide permitted by §§ 184.1265 and 184.1634 of this chapter. In the labeling of such products, all words in the name shall be equal in prominence and type size. The statement “This salt supplies iodide, a necessary nutrient” shall appear on the label immediately following the name and shall be in letters which are not less in height than those required for the declaration of the net quantity of contents as specified in § 101.7 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Salt or table salt for human food use to which iodide has not been added shall bear the statement, “This salt does not supply iodide, a necessary nutrient.” This statement shall appear immediately following the name of the food and shall be in letters which are not less in height than those required for the declaration of the net quantity of contents as specified in § 101.7 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) Salt, table salt, iodized salt, or iodized table salt to which anticaking agents have been added may bear in addition to the ingredient statement designating the anticaking agent(s), a label statement describing the characteristics imparted by such agent(s) (for example, “free flowing”), providing such statement does not appear with greater prominence or in type size larger than the statements which immediately follow the name of the food as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d) Individual serving-sized packages containing less than <FR>1/2</FR> ounce and packages containing more than 2<FR>1/2</FR> pounds <PRTPAGE P="10"/>of a food described in this section shall be exempt from declaration of the statements which paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section require immediately following the name of the food. Such exemption shall not apply to the outer container or wrapper of a multiunit retail package.</P>

              <P>(e) All salt, table salt, iodized salt, or iodized table salt in packages intended for retail sale shipped in interstate commerce 18 months after the date of publication of this statement of policy in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> shall be labeled as prescribed by this section; and if not so labeled, the Food and Drug Administration will regard them as misbranded within the meaning of sections 403 (a) and (f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

              <P>The term <E T="03">principal display panel</E> as it applies to food in package form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term <E T="03">area of the principal display panel</E> means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal display panel, which area shall be:</P>
              <P>(a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side;</P>
              <P>(b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference;</P>

              <P>(c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the total surface of the container: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That where such container presents an obvious “principal display panel” such as the top of a triangular or circular package of cheese, the area shall consist of the entire top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for retail sale.</P>

              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">information panel</E> as it applies to packaged food means that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel with the following exceptions:</P>

              <P>(1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of <PRTPAGE P="12"/>the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part of the label may be used.</P>
              <P>(2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right of any principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(b) All information required to appear on the label of any package of food under §§ 101.4, 101.5, 101.8, 101.9, 101.13, 101.17, 101.36, subpart D of part 101, and part 105 of this chapter shall appear either on the principal display panel or on the information panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less than one-sixteenth inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications of §§ 101.7(h)(1) and (2) and 101.15.</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Soft drinks packaged in bottles manufactured before October 31, 1975 shall be exempt from the requirements prescribed by this section to the extent that information which is blown, lithographed, or formed onto the surface of the bottle is exempt from the size and placement requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Soft drinks packaged in bottles shall be exempt from the size and placement requirements prescribed by this section if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(A) If the soft drink is packaged in a bottle bearing a paper, plastic foam jacket, or foil label, or is packaged in a nonreusable bottle bearing a label lithographed onto the surface of the bottle or is packaged in metal cans, the product shall not be exempt from any requirement of this section other than the exemptions created by § 1.24(a)(5) (ii) and (v) of this chapter and the label shall bear all required information in the specified minimum type size, except the label will not be required to bear the information required by § 101.5 if this information appears on the bottle closure or on the lid of the can in a type size not less than one-sixteenth inch in height, or if embossed on the lid of the can in a type size not less than one-eighth inch in height.</P>
              <P>(B) If the soft drink is packaged in a bottle which does not bear a paper, plastic foam jacket or foil label, or is packaged in a reusable bottle bearing a label lithographed onto the surface of the bottle:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Neither the bottle nor the closure is required to bear nutrition labeling in compliance with § 101.9, except that any multiunit retail package in which it is contained shall bear nutrition labeling if required by § 101.9; and any vending machine in which it is contained shall bear nutrition labeling if nutrition labeling is not present on the bottle or closure, if required by § 101.9.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) All other information pursuant to this section shall appear on the top of the bottle closure prominently and conspicuously in letters and/or numbers no less than one thirty-second inch in height, except that if the information required by § 101.5 is placed on the side of the closure in accordance with § 1.24(a)(5)(ii) of this chapter, such information shall appear in letters and/or numbers no less than one-sixteenth inch in height.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Upon the petition of any interested person demonstrating that the bottle closure is too small to accommodate this information, the Commissioner may by regulation establish an alternative method of disseminating such information.

              <SUBJECT>Identity labeling of food in packaged form.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the commodity.</P>
              <P>(b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:</P>
              <P>(1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,</P>
              <P>(2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence thereof,</P>

              <P>(3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such food.<PRTPAGE P="14"/>
              </P>
              <P>(c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be included in the statement. This specification does not affect the required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.</P>
              <P>(d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.</P>
              <P>(e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform size and prominence, the word “imitation” and, immediately thereafter, the name of the food imitated.</P>
              <P>(1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.</P>
              <P>(2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it substitutes and which it resembles.</P>
              <P>(ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the provisions of § 102.5 of this chapter and that is not false or misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading.</P>
              <P>(3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of the act, in a common or usual name regulation pursuant to part 102 of this chapter, or in a regulation establishing a nutritional quality guideline pursuant to part 104 of this chapter), and which complies with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not be deemed to be an imitation.</P>
              <P>(4) Nutritional inferiority includes:</P>
              <P>(i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present in a measurable amount, but does not include a reduction in the caloric or fat content provided the food is labeled pursuant to the provisions of § 101.9, and provided the labeling with respect to any reduction in caloric content complies with the provisions applicable to caloric content in part 105 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) For the purpose of this section, a measurable amount of an essential nutrient in a food shall be considered to be 2 percent or more of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) of protein listed under § 101.9(c)(7)(iii) and of potassium listed under § 101.9(c)(9) per reference amount customarily consumed and 2 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) of any vitamin or mineral listed under § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) per reference amount customarily consumed, except that selenium, molybdenum, chromium, and chloride need not be considered.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate regulation governing the particular food.</P>
              <P>(f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to subpart B of part 102 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(g) Dietary supplements shall be identified by the term “dietary supplement” as a part of the statement of <PRTPAGE P="15"/>identity, except that the word “dietary” may be deleted and replaced by the name of the dietary ingredients in the product (e.g., calcium supplement) or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredients that are in the product (e.g., herbal supplement with vitamins).</P>

For products that are blends of fats and/or oils and for foods in which fats and/or oils constitute the predominant ingredient, i.e., in which the combined weight of all fat and/or oil ingredients equals or exceeds the weight of the most predominant ingredient that is not a fat or oil, the listing of the common or usual names of such fats and/or oils in parentheses shall be in descending order of predominance. In all other foods in which a blend of fats and/or oils is used as an ingredient, the listing of the common or usual names in parentheses need not be in descending order of predominance if the manufacturer, because of the use of varying mixtures, is unable to adhere to a constant pattern of fats and/or oils in the product. If the fat or oil is completely hydrogenated, the name shall include the term <E T="03">hydrogenated,</E> or if partially hydrogenated, the name shall include the term <E T="03">partially hydrogenated.</E> If each fat and/or oil in a blend or the blend is completely hydrogenated, the term “hydrogenated” may precede the term(s) describing the blend, e.g., “hydrogenated vegetable oil (soybean, cottonseed, and palm oils)”, rather than preceding the name of each individual fat and/or oil; if the blend of fats and/or oils is partially hydrogenated, the term “partially hydrogenated” may be used in the same manner. Fat and/or oil ingredients not present in the product may be listed if they may sometimes be used in the product. Such ingredients shall be identified by words indicating that they may not be present, such as “or”, “and/or”, “contains one or more of the following:”, e.g., “vegetable oil shortening (contains one or more of the following: cottonseed oil, palm oil, soybean oil)”. No fat or oil ingredient shall be listed unless actually present if the fats and/or oils constitute the predominant ingredient of the product, as defined in this paragraph (b)(14).</P>

If the manufacturer is unable to adhere to a constant pattern of firming agents in the food, the listing of the individual firming agents need not be in descending order of predominance. Firming agents not present in the product may be listed if they are sometimes used in the product. Such ingredients shall be identified by words indicating that they may not be present, such as “or”, “and/or”, “contains one or more of the following:”.</P>
              <P>(20) For purposes of ingredient labeling, the term <E T="03">sugar</E> shall refer to sucrose, which is obtained from sugar cane or sugar beets in accordance with the provisions of § 184.1854 of this chapter.</P>

Fish species not present in the fish protein <PRTPAGE P="18"/>ingredient may be listed if they are sometimes used in the product. Such ingredients must be identified by words indicating that they may not be present, such as “or”, “and/or”, or “contains one or more of the following:” Fish protein ingredients may be declared in the ingredient statement by stating the specific common or usual name of each fish species that may be present in parentheses following the collective name “fish protein”, e.g., “fish protein (contains one or more of the following: Pollock, cod, and/or pacific whiting)”.</P>
              <P>(c) When water is added to reconstitute, completely or partially, an ingredient permitted by paragraph (b) of this section to be declared by a class name, the position of the ingredient class name in the ingredient statement shall be determined by the weight of the unreconstituted ingredient plus the weight of the quantity of water added to reconstitute that ingredient, up to the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to single strength. Any water added in excess of the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to single strength shall be declared as “water” in the ingredient statement.</P>
              <P>(d) When foods characterized on the label as “nondairy” contain a caseinate ingredient, the caseinate ingredient shall be followed by a parenthetical statement identifying its source. For example, if the manufacturer uses the term “nondairy” on a creamer that contains sodium caseinate, it shall include a parenthetical term such as “a milk derivative” after the listing of sodium caseinate in the ingredient list.</P>
              <P>(e) If the percentage of an ingredient is included in the statement of ingredients, it shall be shown in parentheses following the name of the ingredient and expressed in terms of percent by weight.

              <SUBJECT>Food; name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The label of a food in packaged form shall specify conspicuously the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor.</P>
              <P>(b) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a corporation, only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used.</P>
              <P>(c) Where the food is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the connection such person has with such food; such as “Manufactured for ___”, “Distributed by ___”, or any other wording that expresses the facts.</P>
              <P>(d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street address, city, State, and ZIP code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP code shall apply only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the ZIP code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including invoice).</P>
              <P>(e) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a food at a place other than his principal place of business, the label may state the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such food was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such statement would be misleading.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Declaration of net quantity of contents.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms of fluid <PRTPAGE P="20"/>measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such commodity.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce.</P>
              <P>(2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof, and shall:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 °F (4 °C).</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 °F (20 °C).</P>
              <P>(3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions thereof.</P>
              <P>(c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such information.</P>
              <P>(d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does not include such fractions.</P>
              <P>(e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.</P>

              <P>(f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at least a space equal to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count (such as “jumbo quart” and “full gallon”) that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets the other requirements of this part.</P>

              <P>(g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That in the case of foods packed in containers designed to deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for use as shown on the container <PRTPAGE P="21"/>are followed. The propellant is included in the net quantity declaration.</P>
              <P>(h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility shall include the specifications that:</P>
              <P>(1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide).</P>
              <P>(2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards.</P>
              <P>(3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the minimum height standards.</P>
              <P>(i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:</P>
              <P>(1) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.</P>
              <P>(2) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches.</P>
              <P>(3) Not less than three-sixteenths inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches.</P>

              <P>(4) Not less than one-fourth inch in height on packages the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, except not less than <FR>1/2</FR> inch in height if the area is more than 400 square inches.
              </P>
              <FP>Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section shall be increased by one-sixteenth of an inch.</FP>
              <P>(j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:</P>
              <P>(1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs (m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) (3) and (4) of this section).</P>
              <P>(2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph (m)(5) of this section).</P>
              <P>(3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term “net weight” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. Use of the terms “net” or “net contents” in terms of fluid measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for example, “Net wt. 6 oz” or “6 oz Net wt.” and “6 fl oz” or “Net contents 6 fl oz”.</P>

              <P>(k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid measure, it shall be <PRTPAGE P="22"/>expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).</P>
              <P>(l) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(m) Examples:</P>
              <P>(1) A declaration of 1<FR>1/2</FR> pounds weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz (1 lb 8 oz),” “Net Wt. 24 oz (1<FR>1/2</FR> lb),” or “Net Wt. 24 oz (1.5 lb)”.</P>
              <P>(2) A declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz”.</P>
              <P>(3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net 32 fl oz (1 qt)”.</P>
              <P>(4) A declaration of 1<FR>3/4</FR> quarts liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1<FR>1/2</FR> pints)” or as “Net 56 fluid oz (1 qt 1 pt 8 oz)”, but not in terms of quart and ounce such as “Net 56 fluid oz (1 quart 24 ounces)”.</P>
              <P>(5) On a random package, declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois may be expressed as “Net Wt. .75 lb”.</P>
              <P>(6) A declaration of 2<FR>1/2</FR> gallons liquid measure shall be expressed as “Net contents 2<FR>1/2</FR> gallons,” “Net contents 2.5 gallons,” or “Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts” and not as “2 gallons 4 pints”.</P>

              <P>(n) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):

              <P>(o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; <E T="03">Provided,</E> that such supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, “jumbo quart” and “full gallon”. Dual or combination declarations of net quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located on the principal display panel.</P>
              <P>(p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal display panel or on other panels.</P>
              <P>(q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.</P>
              <P>(r) The declaration of net quantity of contents on pickles and pickle products, including relishes but excluding one or two whole pickles in clear plastic bags which may be declared by count, shall be expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions thereof.</P>

              <P>(s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: “6-16 oz bottles—(96 fl oz)” or “3-16 oz cans—(net wt. 48 oz)”. For the purposes of this section, “multiunit retail package” means a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package <PRTPAGE P="23"/>but capable of being individually sold in full compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units or prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this section. The provisions of this section do not apply to that butter or margarine covered by the exemptions in § 1.24(a) (10) and (11) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter (except the requirement that food falling below the applicable standard of fill of container shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter), the mislabeled food product, including any food product that fails to bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, may be sold by the manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, State or local governments (schools, prisons, hospitals, etc.): <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include acknowledgment of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, (e.g., “Actual net weight may be as low as _% below labeled quantity”) and that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.</P>
              <P>(2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping container with the statement(s):</P>
              <P>(i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight or volume, “Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or volume where appropriate) may be as low as _% below labeled quantity. This Product Not for Retail Distribution”, the blank to be filled in with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping container, and</P>
              <P>(ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container standard, “Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as _% below standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution”.</P>
              <P>(3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.</P>

              <P>(1) The prospective purchaser can view:</P>
              <P>(i) The calories, serving size, and servings per container listed in the Nutrition Facts label on the vending machine food without any obstruction. The Nutrition Facts label must be in the format required in § 101.9(c) and (d). The Nutrition Facts label must be in a size that permits the prospective purchaser to be able to easily read the nutrition information contained in the Nutrition Facts label on the article of food in the vending machine. Smaller formats allowed for Nutrition Facts for certain food labeling under FDA regulation at § 101.9 are not considered to be a size that a prospective purchaser is able to easily read; or</P>
              <P>(ii) The calories, serving size, and servings per container listed in a reproduction of the Nutrition Facts label on the vending machine food, provided that the reproduction is a reproduction of an actual Nutrition Facts label that complies with § 101.9 for a vending machine food, is presented in a size that permits the prospective purchaser to be able to easily read the nutrition information, and the calories, serving size, and servings per container are displayed by the vending machine before the prospective purchaser makes his or her purchase; or</P>
              <P>(2) The prospective purchaser can otherwise view visible nutrition information, including, at a minimum, the total number of calories for the article of food as sold at the point of purchase. This visible nutrition information must appear on the food label itself. The visible nutrition information must be clear and conspicuous and able to be easily read on the article of food while in the vending machine, in a type size at least 150 percent of the size required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents declaration on the front of the package, and with sufficient color and contrasting background to other print on the label to permit the prospective purchaser to clearly distinguish the information.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements for calorie labeling for certain food sold from vending machines</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability; covered vending machine food.</E> For the purposes of this section, the term “covered vending machine food” means an article of food that is:</P>
              <P>(i) Sold from a vending machine that does not permit the prospective purchaser to examine the Nutrition Facts label prior to purchase as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or otherwise provide visible nutrition information at the point of purchase as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Sold from a vending machine that:</P>
              <P>(A) Is operated by a person engaged in the business of owning or operating 20 or more vending machines; or</P>
              <P>(B) Is operated by a vending machine operator that has voluntarily elected to be subject to the requirements of this section by registering with FDA under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Calorie declaration.</E> (i) The number of calories for a covered vending machine food must be declared in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(A) To the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories and 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.</P>
              <P>(B) The term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear adjacent to the caloric content value for each food in the vending machine.</P>

              <P>(C) The calorie declaration for a packaged food must include the total calories present in the packaged food, regardless of whether the packaged food contains a single serving or multiple servings. The vending machine <PRTPAGE P="25"/>operator may voluntarily disclose calories per serving in addition to the total calories for the food.</P>

              <P>(D) If a covered vending machine food is one where the prospective purchaser selects among options to produce a final vended product (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> vended coffee, hot chocolate or tea with options for added sugar, sugar substitute, milk, and cream), calories must be declared per option or for the final vended products.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calorie declarations for covered vending machine food must be clear and conspicuous and placed prominently in the following manner:</P>

              <P>(A) The calorie declarations may be placed on a sign in close proximity to the article of food or selection button, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> in, on, or adjacent to the vending machine, but not necessarily attached to the vending machine, so long as the calorie declaration is visible at the same time as the food, its name, price, selection button, or selection number is visible. The sign must give calorie declarations for those articles of food that are sold from that particular vending machine.</P>

              <P>(B) When the calorie declaration is in or on the vending machine, the calorie declaration must be in a type size no smaller than the name of the food on the machine (not the label), selection number, or price of the food as displayed on the vending machine, whichever is smallest, with the same prominence, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> the same color, or in a color at least as conspicuous, as the color of the name, if applicable, or price of the food or selection number, and the same contrasting background, or a background at least as contrasting as the background used for the item it is in closest proximity to, <E T="03">i.e.,</E> name, selection number, or price of the food item as displayed on the machine.</P>
              <P>(C) When the calorie declaration is on a sign adjacent to the vending machine, the calorie declaration must be in a type size large enough to render it likely to be read and understood by the prospective purchaser under customary conditions of purchase and use, and in a type that is all black or one color on a white or other neutral background that contrasts with the type color.</P>
              <P>(D) Where the vending machine only displays a picture or other representation or name of the food item, the calorie declaration must be in close proximity to the picture or other representation or name, or in close proximity to the selection button.</P>
              <P>(E) For electronic vending machines (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> machines with digital or electronic or liquid crystal display (LCD) displays), the calorie declaration must be displayed before the prospective purchaser makes his or her purchase.</P>
              <P>(F) For vending machines with few choices, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> popcorn, the calorie declaration may appear on the face of the machine so long as the declaration is prominent, not crowded by other labeling on the machine, and the type size is no smaller than the name of the food on the machine (not the label), selection number, or price of the food as displayed on the vending machine, whichever is smallest.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Voluntary provision of calorie labeling for foods sold from vending machines</E>—(1) <E T="03">Applicability.</E> A vending machine operator that is not subject to the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act may, through its authorized official, voluntarily register with FDA to be subject to the requirements established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

              <SECTNO>§ 101.9</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Nutrition labeling of food.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Nutrition information relating to food shall be provided for all products intended for human consumption and offered for sale unless an exemption is provided for the product in paragraph (j) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) When food is in package form, the required nutrition labeling information shall appear on the label in the format specified in this section.</P>
              <P>(2) When food is not in package form, the required nutrition labeling information shall be displayed clearly at the point of purchase (e.g., on a counter card, sign, tag affixed to the product, or some other appropriate device). Alternatively, the required information may be placed in a booklet, looseleaf binder, or other appropriate format that is available at the point of purchase.</P>

              <P>(3) Solicitation of requests for nutrition information by a statement “For nutrition information write to ___________ ” on the label or in the labeling or advertising for a food, or providing such information in a direct written reply to a solicited or unsolicited request, does not subject the label or the labeling of a food exempted under paragraph (j) of this section to the requirements of this section if the reply to the request conforms to the requirements of this section.<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) If any vitamin or mineral is added to a food so that a single serving provides 50 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for the age group for which the product is intended, as specified in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section, of any one of the added vitamins or minerals, unless such addition is permitted or required in other regulations, e.g., a standard of identity or nutritional quality guideline, or is otherwise exempted by the Commissioner, the food shall be considered a food for special dietary use within the meaning of § 105.3(a)(1)(iii) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) Except as provided in § 101.9(h)(3), all nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.</P>
              <P>(1) The term <E T="03">serving</E> or <E T="03">serving size</E> means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the food. When the food is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(6) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion * * * *” (reference amounts) that appear in § 101.12(b) using the procedures described below. For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ___ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the reference amounts in § 101.12(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrient content claims or health claims.</P>
              <P>(i) For products in discrete units (e.g., muffins, sliced products, such as sliced bread, or individually packaged products within a multiserving package) and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., pancakes and syrup), the serving size shall be declared as follows:</P>
              <P>(A) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the reference amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category;</P>
              <P>(B) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent, but less than 67 percent of the reference amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size;</P>
              <P>(C) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more, but less than 200 percent of the reference amount, the serving size shall be one unit;</P>
              <P>(D) If a unit weighs at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount, the serving size shall be the amount that approximates the reference amount. In addition to providing a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per serving size, the manufacturer shall provide a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per individual unit. The first column would be based on the serving size for the product and the second column would be based on the individual unit. The exemptions in paragraphs (b)(12)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section apply to this provision.</P>
              <P>(E) The serving size for maraschino cherries shall be expressed as 1 cherry with the parenthetical metric measure equal to the average weight of a medium size cherry.</P>

              <P>(F) The serving size for products that naturally vary in size (e.g., pickles, shellfish, whole fish, and fillet of fish) <PRTPAGE P="28"/>may be the amount in ounces that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category. Manufacturers shall adhere to the requirements in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section for expressing the serving size in ounces.</P>
              <P>(G) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., pancakes and syrup), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f).</P>
              <P>(H) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in § 101.9 (that is, are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.</P>
              <P>(ii) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake, pie, pizza, melon, cabbage), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake mix, pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption (e.g., prepared cake packaged with a can of frosting), the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g., <FR>1/12</FR> cake, <FR>1/8</FR> pie, <FR>1/4</FR> pizza, <FR>1/4</FR> melon, <FR>1/6</FR> cabbage) that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category, and may be the fraction of the package used to make the reference amount for the unprepared product determined in § 101.12(c) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use <FR>1/2</FR>, <FR>1/3</FR>, <FR>1/4</FR>, <FR>1/5</FR>, <FR>1/6</FR>, or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.</P>
              <P>(iii) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., breakfast cereal, flour, sugar, dry mixes, concentrates, pancake mixes, macaroni and cheese kits), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., peanut butter and jelly), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the reference amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the reference amount for the combined product determined in § 101.12(f).</P>
              <P>(3) The serving size for meal products and main dish products as defined in § 101.13 (l) and (m) that comes in single-serving containers as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall be the entire content (edible portion only) of the package. Serving size for meal products and main dish products in multiserving containers shall be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 101.12(b) if the product is listed in § 101.12(b). Serving size for meal products and main dish products in multiserving containers that are not listed in § 101.12(b) shall be based on the reference amount according to § 101.12(f).</P>
              <P>(4) A variety pack, such as a package containing several varieties of single-serving units as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and a product having two or more compartments with each compartment containing a different food, shall provide nutrition information for each variety or food per serving size that is derived from the reference amount in § 101.12(b) applicable for each variety or food and the procedures to convert the reference amount to serving size in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) For labeling purposes, the term <E T="03">common household measure</E> or <E T="03">common household unit</E> means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g., <FR>1/4</FR> pizza), ounce (oz), fluid ounce (fl oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar, <PRTPAGE P="29"/>tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(iv), (b)(5)(v), (b)(5)(vi), and (b)(5)(vii) of this section, the following rules shall be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate except for beverages. For beverages, a manufacturer may use fluid ounces. Cups shall be expressed in 1/4- or 1/3-cup increments. Tablespoons shall be expressed as 1, 1 1/3, 1 1/2, 1 2/3, 2, or 3 tablespoons. Teaspoons shall be expressed as 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1, or 2 teaspoons.</P>
              <P>(ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) If paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(5)(ii) of this section are not applicable, ounces may be used with an appropriate visual unit of measure such as a dimension of a piece, e.g., 1 oz (28 g/about <FR>1/2</FR> pickle). Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5 oz increments most closely approximating the reference amount.</P>
              <P>(iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single serving containers and for individually packaged products within multiserving containers (e.g., can, box, package). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., piece, slice, cracker, bar).</P>
              <P>(v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., cake mix, pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.</P>
              <P>(vi) Ounces with an appropriate visual unit of measure, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, may be used for products that naturally vary in size as provided for in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(F) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) As provided for in § 101.9(h)(1), for products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g. dry macaroni and cheese mix, cake and muffin mixes with separate ingredient packages, pancakes and syrup), nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(2)(iii) of this section, or alternatively in ounces with an appropriate visual unit of measure, as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section (e.g., declared as separate components: “3 oz dry macaroni (84 g/about <FR>2/3</FR> cup)” and “1 oz dry cheese mix (28 g/about 2 tbsp);” declared as a composite value: “4 oz (112 g/about <FR>2/3</FR> cup macaroni and 2 tbsp dry cheese mix)”).</P>
              <P>(viii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, 1 fl oz means 30 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 g.</P>
              <P>(ix) When a serving size, determined from the reference amount in § 101.12(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes, e.g., 2.5 tbsp, manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.</P>

              <P>(6) A product that is packaged and sold individually that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount must be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product must be labeled as one serving. In addition to providing a column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per serving, for a product that is packaged and sold individually that contains more than 150 percent and less than 200 percent of the applicable reference amount, the Nutrition Facts label may voluntarily provide, to the left of the column that provides nutrition information per container (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> per serving), an additional column that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values per common household measure that most closely approximates the reference amount.</P>
              <P>(7) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(6) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams) except for single-serving containers.</P>

              <P>(i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which <PRTPAGE P="30"/>will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to § 101.9(b)(9). However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.</P>
              <P>(ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.</P>
              <P>(iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce and fluid ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced bread. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1 oz increments.</P>
              <P>(iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, oz for ounce, and fl oz for fluid ounce.</P>
              <P>(v) For products that only require the addition of water or another ingredient that contains insignificant amounts of nutrients in the amount added and that are prepared in such a way that there are no significant changes to the nutrient profile, the amount of the finished product may be declared in parentheses at the end of the serving size declaration (e.g., <FR>1/2</FR> cup (120 mL) concentrated soup (makes 1 cup prepared)).</P>
              <P>(vi) To promote uniformity in label serving sizes in household measures declared by different manufacturers, FDA has provided a guidance document entitled, “Guidelines for Determining the Gram Weight of the Household Measure.” The guidance document can be obtained from the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.</P>
              <P>(8) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.</P>

              <P>(i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term <E T="03">about</E> (e.g., about 2 servings, about 3.5 servings).</P>
              <P>(ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size (e.g., maraschino cherries, pickles), the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).</P>
              <P>(iii) For random weight products, manufacturers may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the reference amount expressed in the appropriate household measure based on the hierarchy described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Random weight products are foods such as cheeses that are sold as random weights that vary in size, such that the net contents for different containers would vary. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parentheses following the “varied” statement.</P>
              <P>(iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in § 101.9 (that is, are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.</P>

              <P>(v) For packages containing several individually packaged multiserving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number <PRTPAGE P="31"/>of individual multiserving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit.</P>
              <P>(9) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of food as packaged or purchased with the exception of raw fish covered under § 101.42 (see 101.44), packaged single-ingredient products that consist of fish or game meat as provided for in paragraph (j)(11) of this section, and of foods that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed (e.g., canned fish, maraschino cherries, pickled fruits, and pickled vegetables). Declaration of nutrient and food component content of raw fish shall follow the provisions in § 101.45. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of foods that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.</P>
              <P>(10) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information:</P>
              <P>(i) Per 100 g or 100 mL, or per 1 oz or 1 fl oz of the food as packaged or purchased;</P>
              <P>(ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units is more than 1 unit.</P>
              <P>(iii) Per cup popped for popcorn in a multiserving container.</P>
              <P>(11) If a product is promoted on the label, labeling, or advertising for a use that differs in quantity by twofold or greater from the use upon which the reference amount in § 101.12(b) was based (e.g., liquid cream substitutes promoted for use with breakfast cereals), the manufacturer shall provide a second column of nutrition information based on the amount customarily consumed in the promoted use, in addition to the nutrition information per serving derived from the reference amount in § 101.12(b), except that nondiscrete bulk products that are used primarily as ingredients (e.g., flour, sweeteners, shortenings, oils), or traditionally used for multipurposes (e.g., eggs, butter, margarine), and multipurpose baking mixes are exempt from this requirement.</P>

              <P>(12)(i) Products that are packaged and sold individually and that contain at least 200 percent and up to and including 300 percent of the applicable reference amount must provide an additional column within the Nutrition Facts label that lists the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values for the entire package, as well as a column listing the quantitative amounts and percent Daily Values for a serving that is less than the entire package (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> the serving size derived from the reference amount). The first column would be based on the serving size for the product and the second column would be based on the entire contents of the package.</P>

Soluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.”</P>
              <P>(B) “Insoluble fiber” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of insoluble dietary fiber in a serving may be declared voluntarily except that when a claim is made on the label or in labeling about insoluble fiber, label declaration shall be required. Insoluble fiber must meet the definition of dietary fiber in this paragraph (c)(6)(i). The manufacturer must make and keep records in accordance with paragraphs (g)(10) and (11) of this section to verify the declared amount of insoluble fiber in the label and labeling of food when a mixture of insoluble and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber is present in the food. Insoluble fiber content shall be indented under dietary fiber and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.</P>
              <P>(ii) “Total Sugars”: A statement of the number of grams of sugars in a serving, except that the label declaration of sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, or sugar alcohol content. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, if a statement of the total sugars content is not required and, as a result, not declared, the statement “Not a significant source of total sugars” shall be placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values in the same type size. Total sugars shall be defined as the sum of all free mono- and disaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, lactose, and sucrose). Total sugars content shall be indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.</P>

              <P>(iii) “Added Sugars”: A statement of the number of grams of added sugars in a serving, except that label declaration of added sugars content is not required for products that contain less than 1 gram of added sugars in a serving if no claims are made about sweeteners, sugars, added sugars, or sugar alcohol content. Except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, if a statement of the added sugars content is not required and, as a result, not declared, the statement “Not a significant source of added sugars” shall be placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values in the same type size. Added sugars are either added during the processing of foods, or are packaged as such, and include sugars (free, mono and disaccharides), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent fruit or vegetable juice of the same type, except that fruit or vegetable juice concentrated from 100 percent juices sold to consumers, fruit or vegetable juice concentrates used towards the total juice percentage label declaration under § 101.30 or for Brix standardization under § 102.33(g)(2) of this chapter, fruit juice concentrates which are used to formulate the fruit component of jellies, jams, or preserves in accordance with the standard of identities set forth in §§ 150.140 and 150.160 of this chapter, or the fruit component of fruit spreads shall not be labeled as added sugars. Added sugars content <PRTPAGE P="36"/>shall be indented under Total Sugars and shall be prefaced with the word “Includes” followed by the amount (in grams) “Added Sugars” (“Includes `X' g Added Sugars”). It shall be expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero. When a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, and for specific foods containing added sugars, alone or in combination with naturally occurring sugars, where the added sugars are subject to fermentation and/or non-enzymatic browning, the manufacturer must make and keep records in accordance with paragraphs (g)(10) and (11) of this section to verify the declared amount of added sugars in the label and labeling of food.</P>

              <P>(iv) “Sugar alcohol” (VOLUNTARY): A statement of the number of grams of sugar alcohols in a serving may be declared voluntarily on the label, except that when a claim is made on the label or in labeling about sugar alcohol or total sugars, or added sugars when sugar alcohols are present in the food, sugar alcohol content shall be declared. For nutrition labeling purposes, sugar alcohols are defined as the sum of saccharide derivatives in which a hydroxyl group replaces a ketone or aldehyde group and whose use in the food is listed by FDA (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> mannitol or xylitol) or is generally recognized as safe (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> sorbitol). In lieu of the term “sugar alcohol,” the name of the specific sugar alcohol (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “xylitol”) present in the food may be used in the nutrition label provided that only one sugar alcohol is present in the food. Sugar alcohol content shall be indented and expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero.</P>
              <P>(7) “Protein”: A statement of the number of grams of protein in a serving, expressed to the nearest gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement “Contains less than 1 gram” or “less than 1 gram” may be used as an alternative, and if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content may be expressed as zero. When the protein in foods represented or purported to be for adults and children 4 or more years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 20 expressed as a percent, or when the protein in a food represented or purported to be for children greater than 1 but less than 4 years of age has a protein quality value that is a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of less than 40 expressed as a percent, either of the following shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content by weight: The statement “not a significant source of protein,” or a listing aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value” of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) or Reference Daily Intake (RDI), as appropriate, for protein and expressed as a Percent of Daily Value. When the protein quality in a food as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a food represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by the appropriate method of analysis as given in the “Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,” except when official AOAC procedures described in this paragraph (c)(7) require a specific factor other than 6.25, that specific factor shall be used.</P>

              <P>(i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as Percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product <PRTPAGE P="37"/>is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months or children 1 through 3 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it should be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the food is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.</P>
              <P>(ii) The “corrected amount of protein (gram) per serving” for foods represented or purported for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (gram) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00 in “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” except that when official AOAC procedures described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section require a specific factor other than 6.25, that specific factor shall be used. For foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject food protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.</P>
              <P>(iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, a value of 11 grams of protein shall be the RDI for infants through 12 months, a value of 13 grams shall be the DRV for children 1 through 3 years of age, and a value of 71 grams of protein shall be the RDI for pregnant women and lactating women.</P>
              <P>(8) “Vitamins and minerals”: The requirements related to including a statement of the amount per serving of vitamins and minerals are described in this paragraph (c)(8).</P>
              <P>(i) For purposes of declaration of percent of Daily Value as provided for in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, foods represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years, pregnant women, and lactating women shall use the RDIs that are specified for the intended group. For foods represented or purported to be specifically for both infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. The percent Daily Value based on the RDI values for pregnant women and lactating women shall be declared on food represented or purported to be specifically for pregnant women and lactating women. All other foods shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.</P>

              <P>(ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a quantitative amount by weight and percent of the RDI shall include vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium in that order, for infants through 12 months, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, lactating women, and adults and children 4 or more years of age, except quantitative weights for these vitamins and minerals are not required for labels described in paragraph (j)(13) of this section. The declaration of folic acid shall be included as a quantitative amount by weight when added as a nutrient supplement or a claim is made about the nutrient. The declaration of vitamins and minerals in a food, as a quantitative amount by weight and percent of the RDI, may include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section. The declaration of vitamins and minerals shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section as a statement <PRTPAGE P="38"/>of the amount per serving of the vitamins and minerals as described in this paragraph (c)(8)(ii), calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as a percent of the Daily Value, when they are added as a nutrient supplement, or when a claim is made about them, unless otherwise stated as quantitative amount by weight and percent of the Daily Value. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or the labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:</P>
              <P>(A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another food; or</P>
              <P>(B) Included in a food solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredient statement. The declaration may also include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are naturally occurring in the food. The additional vitamins and minerals shall be listed in the order established in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) The percentages for vitamins and minerals shall be expressed to the nearest 2-percent increment up to and including the 10-percent level, the nearest 5-percent increment above 10 percent and up to and including the 50-percent level, and the nearest 10-percent increment above the 50-percent level. Quantitative amounts and percentages of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared in nutrition labeling but may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients)” or “Contains &lt;2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).” Alternatively, except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section, if vitamin D, calcium, iron, or potassium is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement “Not a significant source of—(listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)” is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values. Either statement shall be in the same type size as nutrients that are indented. The quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, shall be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in one serving of the product, using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section, except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams, but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a milligram).</P>

              <P>(3) Information on servings per container and serving size shall immediately follow the heading as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. Such information shall include:</P>

              <P>(i) “__ servings per container”: The number of servings per container, except that this statement is not required on single serving containers as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section or on other food containers when this information is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration. The information required in this paragraph shall be located immediately after the “Nutrition Facts” heading and shall be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, except the type size for this information shall be no smaller than 9 point in the tabular display for small packages as shown in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section and the linear display for small packages as shown in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. For the linear display for small packages as shown in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, the actual number of servings may be listed after the servings per container declaration.</P>

              <P>(ii) “Serving size”: A statement of the serving size as specified in paragraph (b)(7) of this section which shall immediately follow the “__servings per container” declaration. The information required in this paragraph shall be highlighted in bold or extra bold and be in a type size no smaller than 10 point, except the type size shall be no smaller than 9 point for this information in the tabular displays as shown in paragraphs (d)(11) and (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the tabular display for small packages as shown in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) of this section, and the linear display for small packages as shown in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section. The serving size amount must be right justified if adequate space is available. If the “Serving size” declaration does not fit in the allocated space a type size of no smaller than 8 point may be used on packages of any size.</P>
              <P>(4) A subheading “Amount per serving” shall be separated from the serving size information by a bar as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section, except this information is not required for the dual column formats shown in paragraphs (e)(5), (e)(6)(i), and (e)(6)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Information on calories shall immediately follow the subheading “Amount per serving” and shall be declared in one line. If “Calories from saturated fat” is declared, it shall be indented under “Calories” and shall be in a type size no smaller than 8 point.</P>

              <P>(6) The column heading “% Daily Value,” followed by an asterisk (e.g., “% Daily Value*”), shall be separated from information on calories by a bar as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. The position of this column <PRTPAGE P="42"/>heading shall allow for a list of nutrient names and amounts as described in paragraph (d)(7) of this section to be to the left of, and below, this column heading. The column headings “Percent Daily Value,” “Percent DV,” or “% DV” may be substituted for “% Daily Value.”</P>

              <P>(7) Except as provided for in paragraph (j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section, nutrient information for both mandatory and any voluntary nutrients listed in paragraph (c) of this section that are to be declared in the nutrition label, except for folic acid in conventional food and voluntarily declared vitamins and minerals expressed as a statement of the amount per serving calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as a percent Daily Value, shall be declared as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of each nutrient, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be given in a column and followed immediately by the quantitative amount by weight for that nutrient appended with a “g” for grams, “mg” for milligrams, or “mcg” for micrograms as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. The symbol “&lt;” may be used in place of “less than.”</P>
              <P>(ii) A listing of the percent of the DRV as established in paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (c)(9) of this section shall be given in a column aligned under the heading “% Daily Value” established in paragraph (d)(6) of this section with the percent expressed to the nearest whole percent for each nutrient declared in the column described in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section for which a DRV has been established, except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. The percent shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the DRV for the nutrient, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).</P>

              <P>(8) Nutrient information for vitamins and minerals (except sodium) shall be separated from information on other nutrients by a bar and may be arrayed vertically as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> Vitamin D 2 mcg 10%, Calcium 260 mg 20%, Iron 8 mg 45%, Potassium 235 mg 6%) or may be listed horizontally. When listed horizontally in two columns, vitamin D and calcium should be listed on the first line and iron and potassium should be listed on the second line, as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section in the side-by-side display. When more than four vitamins and minerals are declared voluntarily as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section in the label which illustrates the mandatory plus voluntary provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, they may be declared vertically with percentages listed under the column headed “% Daily Value.”</P>
              <P>(9) A footnote, preceded by an asterisk, shall be placed beneath the list of vitamins and minerals and shall be separated from the list by a bar, except that the footnote may be omitted from foods that can use the terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietary insignificant source of calories” on the label or in the labeling of foods as defined in § 101.60(b). The first sentence of the footnote: “The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet” may be used on foods that can use the terms “calorie free,” “free of calories,” “without calories,” “trivial source of calories,” “negligible source of calories,” or “dietary insignificant source of calories” on the label or in the labeling of foods as defined in § 101.60(b). The footnote shall state: “*The % Daily Value tells you how much a nutrient in a serving of food contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice.” If the food product is represented or purported to be for children 1 through 3 years of age, the second sentence of the footnote shall substitute “1,000 calories” for “2,000 calories.”</P>

              <P>(10) Caloric conversion information on a per gram basis for fat, carbohydrate, and protein may be presented beneath the information required in <PRTPAGE P="43"/>paragraph (d)(9) of this section, separated from that information by a hairline. This information may be presented horizontally as shown in paragraph (d)(12) of this section (i.e., “Calories per gram: fat 9, carbohydrate 4, protein 4”) or vertically in columns.</P>
              <P>(11)(i) If the space beneath the information on vitamins and minerals is not adequate to accommodate the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the information required in paragraph (d)(9) may be moved to the right of the column required in paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent Daily Value information. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.</P>
              <P>(ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of potassium is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the nutrients and the percent DV information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.</P>

              <P>(iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> approximately 3 in) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of potassium, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display as shown in the following sample label.</P>

              <P>(f) The declaration of nutrition information may be presented in the simplified format set forth herein when a food product contains insignificant amounts of eight or more of the following: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium; except that for foods intended for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age to which paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section applies, nutrition information may be presented in the simplified format when a food product contains insignificant amounts of six or more of the following: Calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.</P>
              <P>(1) An “insignificant amount” shall be defined as that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and protein, it shall be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than 1 gram.”</P>
              <P>(2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:</P>
              <P>(i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, protein, and sodium;</P>
              <P>(ii) Any other nutrients identified in paragraph (f) of this section that are present in the food in more than insignificant amounts; and</P>
              <P>(iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are required to be added as a nutrient supplement to foods for which a standard of identity exists.</P>
              <P>(iv) Any vitamins or minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section voluntarily added to the food as nutrient supplements.</P>
              <P>(3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the food in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.</P>
              <P>(4) If any nutrients are declared as provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), or (f)(3) of this section as part of the simplified format or if any nutrition claims are made on the label or in labeling, the statement “Not a significant source of ____” (with the blank filled in with the name(s) of any nutrient(s) identified in paragraph (f) of this section that are present in insignificant amounts) shall be included at the bottom of the nutrition label.</P>

              <P>(5) Except as provided for in paragraphs (j)(5) and (j)(13) of this section, nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required, and an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “% DV = % Daily Value” when “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, as shown in paragraph (f)(4).</P>
              <P>(g) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, or in the absence of any common container code or marking, a day's production, constitutes a “lot.”</P>
              <P>(2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of 12 subsamples (consumer units), taken 1 from each of 12 different randomly chosen shipping cases, to be representative of a lot. Unless a particular method of analysis is specified in paragraph (c) of this section, composites shall be analyzed by appropriate methods as given in the “Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,” or, if no AOAC method is available or appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures.</P>
              <P>(3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Class I.</E> Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. When a nutrient is naturally occurring (indigenous) in a food or an ingredient that is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to class II requirements, except that when an exogenous source of the nutrient is also added to the final food product, the total amount of the nutrient in the final food product (indigenous and exogenous) is subject to class I requirements.</P>
              <P>(4) A food with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) unless it meets the following requirements:</P>
              <P>(i) When a vitamin, mineral, protein, or dietary fiber meets the definition of a Class I nutrient, the nutrient content of the composite must be formulated to be at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.</P>

              <P>(ii) When a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or dietary fiber meets the definition of a Class II nutrient, the nutrient content of the composite must be at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls below this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.</P>

              <P>(5) A food with a label declaration of calories, total sugars, added sugars (when the only source of sugars in the food is added sugars), total fat, saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 403(a) of the act if the nutrient content of the composite is greater than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label. <E T="03">Provided,</E> That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value that falls above this level by a factor less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that food at the level involved.</P>

              <P>(6) Reasonable excesses of vitamins, minerals, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, sugar alcohols, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat over labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice. Reasonable deficiencies of calories, total sugars, added sugars, total fat, saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, cholesterol, or sodium under labeled amounts are acceptable within current good manufacturing practice.</P>

              <P>(7) Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the label statement of serving size.<PRTPAGE P="53"/>
              </P>

              <P>(8) Alternatively, compliance with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (g)(1) through (6) of this section may be provided by use of an FDA approved database that has been computed following FDA guideline procedures and where food samples have been handled in accordance with current good manufacturing practice to prevent nutrition loss. FDA approval of a database shall not be considered granted until the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has agreed to all aspects of the database in writing. The approval will be granted where a clear need is presented (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> raw produce and seafood). Approvals will be in effect for a limited time, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> 10 years, and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices. Approval requests shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of § 10.30 of this chapter. Guidance in the use of databases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual—A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases,” available from the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740 or by going to <E T="03">http://www.fda.gov</E>.</P>
              <P>(9) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with the requirements of this section (e.g., to develop adequate nutrient profiles to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section), FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to deal with the situation. Firms in need of such special allowances shall make their request in writing to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-800), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.</P>

              <P>(10) The manufacturer must make and keep written records (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> analyses of databases, recipes, formulations, information from recipes or formulations, or batch records) to verify the declared amount of that nutrient on the Nutrition Facts label as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) When a mixture of dietary fiber, and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber, is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.</P>
              <P>(ii) When a mixture of soluble fiber and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records necessary to verify the amount of the non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.</P>
              <P>(iii) When a mixture of insoluble fiber and added non-digestible carbohydrate(s) that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records necessary to verify the amount of the non-digestible carbohydrate(s) added to the food that does not meet the definition of dietary fiber.</P>
              <P>(iv) When a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient).</P>
              <P>(v) When the amount of sugars added to food products is reduced through non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation, manufacturers must:</P>
              <P>(A) Make and keep records of all relevant scientific data and information relied upon by the manufacturer that demonstrates the amount of added sugars in the food after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation and a narrative explaining why the data and information are sufficient to demonstrate the amount of added sugars declared in the finished food, provided the data and information used is specific to the type of food that is subject to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation; or</P>

              <P>(B) Make and keep records of the amount of added sugars added to the food before and during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether <PRTPAGE P="54"/>as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) and in no event shall the amount of added sugars declared exceed the amount of total sugars on the label; or</P>
              <P>(C) Submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an alternative means of compliance. The petition must provide scientific data or other information for why the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product is likely to have a significant reduction in added sugars compared to the amount added prior to non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation. A significant reduction would be where reduction in added sugars after non-enzymatic browning and/or fermentation may be significant enough to impact the label declaration for added sugars by an amount that exceeds the reasonable deficiency acceptable within good manufacturing practice under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. In addition, the scientific data or other information must include the reason that the manufacturer is unable to determine a reasonable approximation of the amount of added sugars in a serving of their finished product and a description of the process that they used to come to that conclusion.</P>
              <P>(vi) When a mixture of <E T="03">all rac</E>-α-tocopherol and RRR-α-tocopherol is present in a food, manufacturers must make and keep written records of the amount of <E T="03">all rac</E>-α-tocopherol added to the food and RRR-α-tocopherol in the finished food.</P>
              <P>(vii) When a mixture of folate and folic acid is present in a food, manufacturers must make and keep written records of the amount of synthetic folate and/or folic acid added to the food and the amount of naturally-occurring folate in the finished food.</P>
              <P>(11) Records necessary to verify certain nutrient declarations that are specified in paragraph (g)(10) of this section must be kept for a period of at least 2 years after introduction or delivery for introduction of the food into interstate commerce. Such records must be provided to FDA upon request, during an inspection, for official review and photocopying or other means of reproduction. Records required to verify information on the label may be kept either as original records, true copies (such as photocopies, pictures, scanned copies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records), or electronic records which must be kept in accordance with part 11 of this chapter. These records must be accurate, indelible, and legible.</P>
              <P>Failure to make and keep the records or provide the records to appropriate regulatory authorities, as required by this paragraph (g)(11), would result in the food being misbranded under section 403(a)(1) of the act.</P>
              <P>(h) Products with separately packaged ingredients or foods, with assortments of food, or to which other ingredients are added by the user may be labeled as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) If a product consists of two or more separately packaged ingredients enclosed in an outer container or of assortments of the same type of food (e.g., assorted nuts or candy mixtures) in the same retail package, nutrition labeling shall be located on the outer container or retail package (as the case may be) to provide information for the consumer at the point of purchase. However, when two or more food products are simply combined together in such a manner that no outer container is used, or no outer label is available, each product shall have its own nutrition information, e.g., two boxes taped together or two cans combined in a clear plastic overwrap. When separately packaged ingredients or assortments of the same type of food are intended to be eaten at the same time, the nutrition information may be specified per serving for each component or as a composite value.</P>
              <P>(2) If a product consists of two or more separately packaged foods that are intended to be eaten individually and that are enclosed in an outer container (e.g., variety packs of cereals or snack foods), the nutrition information shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Be specified per serving for each food in a location that is clearly visible to the consumer at the point of purchase; and</P>

              <P>(ii) Be presented in separate nutrition labels or in one aggregate nutrition label with separate columns for the quantitative amount by weight and the percent Daily Value for each food.<PRTPAGE P="55"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) If a package contains a variety of foods, or an assortment of foods, and is in a form intended to be used as a gift, the nutrition labeling shall be in the form required by paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, but it may be modified as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Nutrition information may be presented on the label of the outer package or in labeling within or attached to the outer package.</P>

              <P>(ii) In the absence of a reference amount customarily consumed in § 101.12(b) that is appropriate for the variety or assortment of foods in a gift package, the following may be used as the standard serving size for purposes of nutrition labeling of foods subject to this paragraph: 1 ounce for solid foods; 2 fluid ounces for nonbeverage liquids (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> syrups); 8 ounces for beverages that consist of milk and fruit juices, nectars and fruit drinks; and 12 fluid ounces for other beverages. However, the reference amounts customarily consumed in § 101.12(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether individual foods in a gift package qualify for nutrient content claims or health claims.</P>
              <P>(iii) The number of servings per container may be stated as “varied.”</P>
              <P>(iv) Nutrition information may be provided per serving for individual foods in the package, or, alternatively, as a composite per serving for reasonable categories of foods in the package having similar dietary uses and similar significant nutritional characteristics. Reasonable categories of foods may be used only if accepted by FDA. In determining whether a proposed category is reasonable, FDA will consider whether the values of the characterizing nutrients in the foods proposed to be in the category meet the compliance criteria set forth in paragraphs (g)(3) through (6) of this section. Proposals for such categories may be submitted in writing to the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.</P>
              <P>(v) If a food subject to paragraph (j)(13) of this section because of its small size is contained in a gift package, the food need not be included in the determination of nutrition information under paragraph (h) of this section if it is not specifically listed in a promotional catalogue as being present in the gift package, and:</P>
              <P>(A) It is used in small quantities primarily to enhance the appearance of the gift package; or</P>
              <P>(B) It is included in the gift package as a free gift or promotional item.</P>

              <P>(4) If a food is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare nutrition information on the basis of the food as consumed in the format required in paragraph (e) of this section; <E T="03">e.g.,</E> a dry ready-to-eat cereal may be described with the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the cereal as sold (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> per ounce), and the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the cereal and milk as suggested in the label (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> per ounce of cereal and <FR>1/2</FR>cup of vitamin D fortified skim milk); and a cake mix may be labeled with the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the dry mix (per serving) and the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amounts for the serving of the final cake when prepared, as shown in paragraph (e)(5) of this section: Provided, that, the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(13) and (j)(17) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in compliance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(j) The following foods are exempt from this section or are subject to special labeling requirements:</P>

              <P>(1)(i) Food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a retailer) who has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers that is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information <PRTPAGE P="56"/>in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section, § 101.10, or § 101.11, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship foods into the United States, the business activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in the United States.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in § 101.11, food products that are:</P>
              <P>(i) Served in restaurants, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section;</P>

              <P>(ii) Served in other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> institutional food service establishments, such as schools, hospitals, and cafeterias; transportation carriers, such as trains and airplanes; bakeries, delicatessens, and retail confectionery stores where there are facilities for immediate consumption on the premises; food service vendors, such as lunch wagons, ice cream shops, mall cookie counters, vending machines, and sidewalk carts where foods are generally consumed immediately where purchased or while the consumer is walking away, including similar foods sold from convenience stores; and food delivery systems or establishments where ready-to-eat foods are delivered to homes or offices), <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising, except as provided in § 101.8(c). Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section;</P>
              <P>(iii) Sold only in such facilities, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section;</P>
              <P>(iv) Used only in such facilities and not served to the consumer in the package in which they are received (e.g., foods that are not packaged in individual serving containers); or</P>

              <P>(v) Sold by a distributor who principally sells food to such facilities: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That:</P>
              <P>(A) This exemption shall not be available for those foods that are manufactured, processed, or repackaged by that distributor for sale to any persons other than restaurants or other establishments that serve food for immediate human consumption, and</P>
              <P>(B) The manufacturer of such products is responsible for providing the nutrition information on the products if there is a reasonable possibility that the product will be purchased directly by consumers.</P>
              <P>(3) Except as provided in § 101.11, food products that are:</P>
              <P>(i) Of the type of food described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (j)(2)(ii) of this section,</P>

              <P>(iv) Processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, and</P>

              <P>(v) Not offered for sale outside of that establishment (e.g., ready-to-eat foods that are processed and prepared on-site and sold by independent delicatessens, bakeries, or retail confectionery stores where there are no facilities for immediate human consumption; by in-store delicatessen, bakery, or candy departments; or at self-service food bars such as salad bars), <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section.</P>

              <P>(4) Except as provided in § 101.11, foods that contain insignificant amounts of all of the nutrients and food components required to be included in the declaration of nutrition information under paragraph (c) of this section, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition <PRTPAGE P="57"/>information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section. An insignificant amount of a nutrient or food component shall be that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and protein, it shall be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than 1 gram.” Examples of foods that are exempt under this paragraph include coffee beans (whole or ground), tea leaves, plain unsweetened instant coffee and tea, condiment-type dehydrated vegetables, flavor extracts, and food colors.</P>

              <P>(5)(i) Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age shall bear nutrition labeling. The nutrients declared for infants through 12 months of age and children 1 through 3 years of age shall include calories, total fat, saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, and the following vitamins and minerals: Vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium.</P>

              <P>(8) Medical foods as defined in section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3)). A medical food is a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation. A food is subject to this exemption only if:</P>

              <P>(ii) It is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone;</P>
              <P>(iii) It provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation;</P>
              <P>(iv) It is intended to be used under medical supervision; and</P>

              <P>(v) It is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical <PRTPAGE P="59"/>supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.</P>

              <P>(10) Raw fruits, vegetables, and fish subject to section 403(q)(4) of the act, except that the labeling of such foods should adhere to guidelines in § 101.45. This exemption is contingent on the food bearing no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.45. The term <E T="03">fish</E> includes freshwater or marine fin fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, including shellfish, amphibians, and other forms of aquatic animal life.</P>
              <P>(11) Packaged single-ingredient products that consist of fish or game meat (i.e., animal products not covered under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act, such as flesh products from deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, or ostrich) subject to this section may provide required nutrition information for a 3-ounce cooked edible portion (i.e., on an “as prepared” basis), except that:</P>
              <P>(i) Such products that make claims that are based on values as packaged must provide nutrition information on an as packaged basis, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Nutrition information is not required for custom processed fish or game meats.</P>
              <P>(12) Game meats (i.e., animal products not covered under the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act, such as flesh products from deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, or ostrich) may provide required nutrition information on labeling in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>

              <P>(13)(i) Foods in small packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the labels for these foods bear no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or advertising, except as provided in § 101.8(c). Claims or other nutrition information, except as provided in § 101.8(c), subject the food to the provisions of this section.</P>

              <P>(A) The manufacturer, packer, or distributor shall provide on the label of packages that qualify for and use this exemption an address or telephone number that a consumer can use to obtain the required nutrition information (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “For nutrition information, call 1-800-123-4567”).</P>
              <P>(B) When such products bear nutrition labeling, either voluntarily or because nutrition claims or other nutrition information is provided, all required information shall be in type size no smaller than 6 point or all upper-case type of 1-16 inches minimum height, except that individual serving-size packages of food served with meals in restaurants, institutions, and on board passenger carriers, and not intended for sale at retail, may comply with § 101.2(c)(2).</P>

              <P>(D) <E T="03">Full-time equivalent employee</E> means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. This number shall be determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in a year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks).</P>
              <P>(k) A food labeled under the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be misbranded under sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the act if its label or labeling represents, suggests, or implies:</P>

              <P>(1) That the food, because of the presence or absence of certain dietary properties, is adequate or effective in the <PRTPAGE P="63"/>prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease or symptom. Information about the relationship of a dietary property to a disease or health-related condition may only be provided in conformance with the requirements of § 101.14 and part 101, subpart E.</P>
              <P>(2) That the lack of optimum nutritive quality of a food, by reason of the soil on which that food was grown, is or may be responsible for an inadequacy or deficiency in the quality of the daily diet.</P>
              <P>(3) That the storage, transportation, processing, or cooking of a food is or may be responsible for an inadequacy or deficiency in the quality of the daily diet.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nutrition labeling of restaurant foods whose labels or labeling bear nutrient content claims or health claims.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.9 shall be provided upon request for any restaurant food or meal for which a nutrient content claim (as defined in § 101.13 or in subpart D of this part) or a health claim (as defined in § 101.14 and permitted by a regulation in subpart E of this part) is made, except that information on the nutrient amounts that are the basis for the claim (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “low fat, this meal provides less than 10 grams of fat”) may serve as the functional equivalent of complete nutrition information as described in § 101.9. For the purposes of this section, restaurant food includes two categories of food. It includes food which is served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments. It also includes food which is processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, which <PRTPAGE P="64"/>is ready for human consumption, which is of the type described in the previous sentence, and which is offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate human consumption in such establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such establishment. For standard menu items that are offered for sale in covered establishments (as defined in § 101.11(a)), the information in the written nutrition information required by § 101.11(b)(2)(ii)(A) will serve to meet the requirements of this section. Nutrient levels may be determined by nutrient databases, cookbooks, or analyses or by other reasonable bases that provide assurance that the food or meal meets the nutrient requirements for the claim. Presentation of nutrition labeling may be in various forms, including those provided in § 101.45 and other reasonable means.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this section. In addition, for purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Authorized official of a restaurant or similar retail food establishment</E> means the owner, operator, agent in charge, or other person authorized by the owner, operator, or agent in charge to register the restaurant or similar retail food establishment, which is not otherwise subject to section 403(q)(5)(H) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with FDA for the purposes of paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Combination meal</E> means a standard menu item that consists of more than one food item, for example a meal that includes a sandwich, a side dish, and a drink. A combination meal may be represented on the menu or menu board in narrative form, numerically, or pictorially. Some combination meals may include a variable menu item or be a variable menu item as defined in this paragraph where the components may vary. For example, the side dish may vary among several options (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> fries, salad, or onion rings) or the drinks may vary (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> soft drinks, milk, or juice) and the customer selects which of these items will be included in the meal.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Covered establishmen</E>t means a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is a part of a chain with 20 or more locations doing business under the same name (regardless of the type of ownership, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> individual franchises) and offering for sale substantially the same menu items, as well as a restaurant or similar retail food establishment that is registered to be covered under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Custom order</E> means a food order that is prepared in a specific manner based on an individual customer's request, which requires the covered establishment to deviate from its usual preparation of a standard menu item, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> a club sandwich without the bacon if the establishment usually includes bacon in its club sandwich.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Daily special</E> means a menu item that is prepared and offered for sale on a particular day, that is not routinely listed on a menu or menu board or offered by the covered establishment, and that is promoted by the covered establishment as a special menu item for that particular day.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Doing business under the same name</E> means sharing the same name. The term “name” refers to either:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of the establishment presented to the public; or</P>

              <P>(ii) If there is no name of the establishment presented to the public (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an establishment with the generic descriptor “concession stand”), the name of the parent entity of the establishment. When the term “name” refers to the name of the establishment presented to the public under paragraph (i) of this definition, the term “same” includes names that are slight variations of each other, for example, due to the region, location, or size (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “New York Ave. Burgers” and “Pennsylvania Ave. Burgers” or “ABC” and “ABC Express”).</P>

Determining whether a writing is or is part of the primary writing of the covered establishment from which a customer makes an order selection depends on a number of factors, including whether the writing lists the name of a standard menu item (or an image depicting the standard menu item) and the price of the standard menu item, and whether the writing can be used by a customer to make an order selection at the time the customer is viewing the writing. The menus may be in different forms, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> booklets, pamphlets, or single sheets of paper. Menu boards include those inside a covered establishment as well as drive-through menu boards at covered establishments.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Offering for sale substantially the same menu items</E> means offering for sale a significant proportion of menu items that use the same general recipe and are prepared in substantially the same way with substantially the same food components, even if the name of the menu item varies, (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Bay View Crab Cake” and “Ocean View Crab Cake”). “Menu items” in this definition refers to food items that are listed on a menu or menu board or that are offered as self-service food or food on display. Restaurants and similar retail food establishments that are part of a chain can still be offering for sale substantially the same menu items if the availability of some menu items varies within the chain.

              <P>(A) The number of calories contained in each standard menu item listed on the menu or menu board, as usually prepared and offered for sale. In the case of multiple-serving standard menu items, this means the calories declared must be for the whole menu item listed on the menu or menu board as usually prepared and offered for sale (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “pizza pie: 1600 cal”); or per discrete serving unit as long as the discrete serving unit (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pizza slice) and total number of discrete serving units contained in the menu item are declared on the menu or menu board, and the menu item is usually prepared and offered for sale divided in discrete serving units (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “pizza pie: 200 cal/slice, 8 slices”). The calories must be declared in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The number of calories must be listed adjacent to the name or the price of the associated standard menu item, in a type size no smaller than the type size of the name or the price of the associated standard menu item, whichever is smaller, in the same color, or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the name of the associated standard menu item, and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the name of the associated standard menu item.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) To the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories and to the nearest 10-calorie increment above 50 calories, except that amounts less than 5 calories may be expressed as zero.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear as a heading above a column listing the number of calories for each standard menu item or adjacent to the number of calories for each standard menu item. If the term “Calories” or “Cal” appears as a heading above a column of calorie declarations, the term must be in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of the name or price of any menu item on that menu or menu board in the same color or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for that name or price and in the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for that name or price. If the term “Calories” or “Cal” appears adjacent to the number of calories for the standard menu item, the term “Calories” or “Cal” must appear in the same type size and in the same color and contrasting background as the number of calories.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) Additional requirements that apply to each individual variable menu item:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) When the menu or menu board lists flavors or varieties of an entire individual variable menu item (such as soft drinks, ice cream, doughnuts, dips, and chicken that can be grilled or fried), the calories must be declared separately for each listed flavor or variety. Where flavors or varieties have the same calorie amounts (after rounding in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section), the calorie declaration for such flavors or varieties can be listed as a single calorie declaration adjacent to the flavors or varieties, provided that the calorie declaration specifies that the calorie amount listed represents the calorie amounts for each individual flavor or variety.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) When the menu or menu board does not list flavors or varieties for an entire individual variable menu item, and only includes a general description of the variable menu item (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “soft drinks”), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations where only two options are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “150/250 calories”) or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(7) of this section where more than two options are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “100-250 calories”).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) When the menu or menu board describes flavors or varieties for only <PRTPAGE P="67"/>part of an individual variable menu item (such as different types of cheese offered in a grilled cheese sandwich (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Grilled Cheese (Cheddar or Swiss)”), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations where only two options are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “450/500 calories”) or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">7</E>) of this section where more than two options are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “450-550 calories”).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) Additional requirements that apply to a variable menu item that is offered for sale with the option of adding toppings listed on the menu or menu board. When the menu or menu board lists toppings that can be added to a menu item (such as pizza or ice cream):</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) The calories must be declared for the basic preparation of the menu item as listed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “small pizza pie,” “single scoop ice cream”).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) The calories must be separately declared for each topping listed on the menu or menu board (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, onions on pizza; fudge, almonds, sprinkles on ice cream), specifying that the calories are added to the calories contained in the basic preparation of the menu item. Where toppings have the same calorie amounts (after rounding in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section), the calorie declaration for such toppings can be listed as a single calorie declaration adjacent to the toppings, provided that the calorie declaration specifies that the calorie amount listed represents the calorie amount for each individual topping.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) The calories for the basic preparation of the menu item must be declared for each size of the menu item. The calories for each topping listed on the menu or menu board must be declared for each size of the menu item, or declared using a slash between the two calorie declarations for each topping where only two sizes of the menu item are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “adds 150/250 cal”) or as a range for each topping in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">7</E>) of this section where more than two sizes of the menu item are available (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “adds 100-250 cal”). If a slash between two calorie declarations or a range of calorie declarations is used, the menu or menu board must indicate that the variation in calories for each topping arises from the size of the menu item to which the toppings are added.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) If the amount of the topping included on the basic preparation of the menu item decreases based on the total number of toppings ordered for the menu item (such as is sometimes the case with pizza toppings), the calories for each topping must be declared as single values representing the calories for each topping when added to a one-topping menu item, specifying that the calorie declaration is for the topping when added to a one-topping menu item.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) Additional requirements that apply to a combination meal. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">6</E>)(<E T="03">iv</E>) of this section:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) When the menu or menu board lists two options for menu items in a combination meal (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a sandwich with a side salad or chips), the calories must be declared for each option with a slash between the two calorie declarations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “350/450 calories”).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) When the menu or menu board lists three or more options for menu items in a combination meal (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a sandwich with chips, a side salad, or fruit), the calories must be declared as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">7</E>) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “350-500 calories”).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iii</E>) When the menu or menu board includes a choice to increase or decrease the size of a combination meal, the calorie difference must be declared for the increased or decreased size with a slash between two calorie declarations (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Adds 100/150 calories,” “Subtracts 100/150 calories”) if the menu or menu board lists two options for menu items in the combination meal, or as a range in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">7</E>) of this section (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Adds 100-250 calories,” “Subtracts 100-250 calories”) if the menu or menu board lists three or more options for menu items in the combination meal.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">iv</E>) Where the menu or menu board describes an opportunity for a consumer to combine standard menu items for a special price (<E T="03">e.g.,”</E>Combine Any <PRTPAGE P="68"/>Sandwich with Any Soup or Any Salad for $8.99”), and the calories for each standard menu item, including each size option as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A)(6)(<E T="03">iii</E>) of this section if applicable, available for the consumer to combine are declared elsewhere on the menu or menu board, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A)(<E T="03">6</E>)(<E T="03">i</E>), (<E T="03">ii</E>), and (<E T="03">iii</E>) of this section do not apply.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">7</E>) Additional format requirements for declaring calories for an individual variable menu item, a combination meal, and toppings as a range, if applicable. Calories declared as a range must be in the format “xx-yy,” where “xx” is the caloric content of the lowest calorie variety, flavor, or combination, and “yy” is the caloric content of the highest calorie variety, flavor, or combination.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">8</E>) Exception for a variable menu item that has no clearly identifiable upper bound to the range of calories: If the variable menu item appears on the menu or menu board and is a self-service food or food on display, and there is no clearly identifiable upper bound to the range, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> all-you-can-eat buffet, then the menu or menu board must include a statement, adjacent to the name or price of the item, referring customers to the self-service facility for calorie information, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> “See buffet for calorie declarations.” This statement must appear in a type size no smaller than the type size of the name or price of the variable menu item, whichever is smaller, and in the same color or a color at least as conspicuous as that used for that name or price, with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for that name or price.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) Additional requirements that apply to beverages that are not self-service. For beverages that are not self-service, calories must be declared based on the full volume of the cup served without ice, unless the covered establishment ordinarily dispenses and offers for sale a standard beverage fill (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a fixed amount that is less than the full volume of the cup per cup size) or dispenses a standard ice fill (<E T="03">i.e.,</E> a fixed amount of ice per cup size). If the covered establishment ordinarily dispenses and offers for sale a standard beverage fill or dispenses a standard ice fill, the covered establishment must declare calories based on such standard beverage fill or standard ice fill.</P>
              <P>(B) The following statement designed to enable consumers to understand, in the context of a total daily diet, the significance of the calorie information provided on menus and menu boards: “2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs vary.” For menus and menu boards targeted to children, the following options may be used as a substitute for or in addition to the succinct statement: “1,200 to 1,400 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice for children ages 4 to 8 years, but calorie needs vary.” or “1,200 to 1,400 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice for children ages 4 to 8 years and 1,400 to 2,000 calories a day for children ages 9 to 13 years, but calorie needs vary.”</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) This statement must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu or menu board and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the calorie declarations and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the calorie declarations.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For menus, this statement must appear on the bottom of each page of the menu. On menu pages that also bear the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section, this statement must appear immediately above, below, or beside the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For menu boards, this statement must appear on the bottom of the menu board, immediately above, below, or beside the statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of this section.</P>

              <P>(C) The following statement regarding the availability of the additional written nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be on all forms of the menu or menu board: “Additional nutrition information available upon request.”<PRTPAGE P="69"/>
              </P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) This statement must be posted prominently and in a clear and conspicuous manner in a type size no smaller than the smallest type size of any calorie declaration appearing on the same menu or menu board and in the same color or in a color at least as conspicuous as that used for the caloric declarations, and with the same contrasting background or a background at least as contrasting as that used for the caloric declarations.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) For menus, the statement must appear on the bottom of the first page with menu items immediately above, below, or beside the succinct statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) For menu boards, the statement must appear on the bottom of the menu board immediately above, below, or beside the succinct statement required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The following nutrition information for a standard menu item must be available in written form on the premises of the covered establishment and provided to the customer upon request. This nutrition information must be presented in the order listed and using the measurements listed, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Rounding of these nutrients must be in compliance with § 101.9(c). The information must be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, including using a color, type size, and contrasting background that render the information likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. Covered establishments may use the abbreviations allowed for Nutrition Facts for certain packaged foods in § 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(B):</P>
              <P>(A)(<E T="03">1</E>) Total calories (cal);</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">11</E>) Protein (g).</P>
              <P>(B) If a standard menu item contains insignificant amounts of all the nutrients required to be disclosed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the establishment is not required to include nutrition information regarding the standard menu item in the written form. However, if the covered establishment makes a nutrient content claim or health claim, the establishment is required to provide nutrition information on the nutrient that is the subject of the claim in accordance with § 101.10. For standard menu items that contain insignificant amounts of six or more of the required nutrients, the declaration of nutrition information required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be presented in a simplified format.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) An insignificant amount is defined as that amount that allows a declaration of zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and protein, it must be an amount that allows a declaration of “less than one gram.”</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The simplified format must include information, in a column, list, or table, on the following nutrients:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrates, protein, and sodium; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Calories from fat, and any other nutrients identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section that are present in more than insignificant amounts.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the simplified format is used, the statement “Not a significant source of __” (with the blank filled in with the names of the nutrients required to be declared in the written nutrient information and calories from fat that are present in insignificant amounts) must be included at the bottom of the list of nutrients.</P>
              <P>(C) For variable menu items, the nutrition information listed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be declared as follows for each size offered for sale:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section must be declared for the basic preparation of the item and, separately, for each topping, flavor, or variable component.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Additional format requirements for toppings if the amount of the topping included on the basic preparation of the menu item decreases based on <PRTPAGE P="70"/>the total number of toppings ordered for the menu item (such as is sometimes the case with pizza toppings). The nutrients for such topping must be declared as single values representing the nutrients for each topping when added to a one-topping menu item, specifying that the nutrient declaration is for the topping when added to a one-topping menu item.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) If the calories and other nutrients are the same for different flavors, varieties, and variable components of the combination meal, each variety, flavor, and variable component of the combination meal is not required to be listed separately. All items that have the same nutrient values could be listed together with the nutrient values listed only once.</P>
              <P>(D) The written nutrition information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be provided on a counter card, sign, poster, handout, booklet, loose leaf binder, or electronic device such as a computer, or in a menu, or in any other form that similarly permits the written declaration of the required nutrient content information for all standard menu items. If the written nutrition information is not in a form that can be given to the customer upon request, it must be readily available in a manner and location on the premises that allows the customer/consumer to review the written nutrition information upon request.</P>
              <P>(iii) The following must be provided for a standard menu item that is self-service or on display.</P>
              <P>(A) Calories per displayed food item (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a bagel, a slice of pizza, or a muffin), or if the food is not offered for sale in a discrete unit, calories per serving (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> scoop, cup), and the serving or discrete unit used to determine the calorie content (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “per scoop” or “per muffin”) on either: A sign adjacent to and clearly associated with the corresponding food; (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “150 calories per scoop); a sign attached to a sneeze guard with the calorie declaration and the serving or unit used to determine the calorie content above each specific food so that the consumer can clearly associate the calorie declaration with the food, except that if it is not clear to which food the calorie declaration and serving or unit refers, then the sign must also include the name of the food, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Broccoli and cheese casserole—200 calories per scoop”; or a single sign or placard listing the calorie declaration for several food items along with the names of the food items, so long as the sign or placard is located where a consumer can view the name, calorie declaration, and serving or unit of a particular item while selecting that item.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.12</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The general principles and factors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (reference amounts) which are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are that:</P>

              <P>(1) FDA calculated the reference amounts for persons 4 years of age or <PRTPAGE P="74"/>older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.</P>
              <P>(2) FDA calculated the reference amounts for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These reference amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such reference amounts are to be used only when the food is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.</P>
              <P>(3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.</P>
              <P>(4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, FDA considered the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion.</P>
              <P>(5) When survey data were insufficient, FDA took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:</P>
              <P>(i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;</P>
              <P>(ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;</P>
              <P>(iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.</P>
              <P>(6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the reference amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.</P>
              <P>(7) The reference amount is based on the major intended use of the food (e.g., milk as a beverage and not as an addition to cereal).</P>
              <P>(8) The reference amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other foods, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., butter), are based on use in the form purchased.</P>
              <P>(9) FDA sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform reference amount.</P>
              <P>(b) The following reference amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:</P>

              <P>(c) If a product requires further preparation, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a reference amount for the product in the prepared form, but not the unprepared form, then the reference amount for the unprepared product must be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the reference amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(d) The reference amount for an imitation or substitute food or altered food, such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the same as for the food for which it is offered as a substitute.</P>
              <P>(e) If a food is modified by incorporating air (aerated), and thereby the density of the food is lowered by 25 percent or more in weight than that of an appropriate reference regular food as described in § 101.13(j)(1)(ii)(A), and the reference amount of the regular food is in grams, the manufacturer may determine the reference amount of the aerated food by adjusting for the difference in density of the aerated food relative to the density of the appropriate reference food provided that the manufacturer will show FDA detailed protocol and records of all data that were used to determine the density-adjusted reference amount for the aerated food. The reference amount for the aerated food shall be rounded to the nearest 5-g increment. Such products shall bear a descriptive term indicating that extra air has been incorporated (e.g., whipped, aerated). The density-adjusted reference amounts described in paragraph (b) of this section may not be used for cakes except for cheese cake. The differences in the densities of different types of cakes having different degrees of air incorporation have already been taken into consideration in determining the reference amounts for cakes in § 101.12(b). In determining the difference in density of the aerated and the regular food, the manufacturer shall adhere to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) The regular and the aerated product must be the same in size, shape, and volume. To compare the densities of products having nonsmooth surfaces (e.g., waffles), manufacturers shall use a device or method that ensures that the volumes of the regular and the aerated products are the same.</P>
              <P>(2) Sample selections for the density measurements shall be done in accordance with the provisions in § 101.9(g).</P>
              <P>(3) Density measurements of the regular and the aerated products shall be conducted by the same trained operator using the same methodology (e.g., the same equipment, procedures, and techniques) under the same conditions.</P>
              <P>(4) Density measurements shall be replicated a sufficient number of times to ensure that the average of the measurements is representative of the true differences in the densities of the regular and the “aerated” products.</P>

              <P>(f) For products that have no reference amount listed in paragraph (b) of this section for the unprepared or the prepared form of the product and <PRTPAGE P="86"/>that consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., peanut putter and jelly, cracker and cheese pack, pancakes and syrup, cake and frosting), the reference amount for the combined product shall be determined using the following rules:</P>

              <P>(1) The reference amount for the combined product must be the reference amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> peanut butter, pancakes, cake) plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.</P>

              <P>(2) If the reference amounts are in compatible units, the weights or volumes must be summed (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the reference amount for equal volumes of peanut butter and jelly for which peanut butter is represented as the main ingredient would be 4 tablespoons (tbsp) (2 tbsp peanut butter plus 2 tbsp jelly)). If the reference amounts are in incompatible units, all amounts must be converted to weights and summed, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> the reference amount for pancakes and syrup would be 110 g (the reference amount for pancakes) plus the weight of the proportioned amount of syrup.</P>
              <P>(g) The reference amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutrient content claims, such as “low calorie,” and for health claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the reference amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the reference amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parenthesis, by the amount in common household measure if the reference amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures (e.g., for a beverage, “Very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 240 mL (8 fl oz)”).</P>
              <P>(h) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his or her own initiative or in response to a petition submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a reference amount in paragraph (b) of this section. A petition to establish or amend a reference amount shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) Objective of the petition;</P>
              <P>(2) A description of the product;</P>
              <P>(3) A complete sample product label including nutrition label, using the format established by regulation;</P>
              <P>(4) A description of the form (e.g., dry mix, frozen dough) in which the product will be marketed;</P>
              <P>(5) The intended dietary uses of the product with the major use identified (e.g., milk as a beverage and chips as a snack);</P>
              <P>(6) If the intended use is primarily as an ingredient in other foods, list of foods or food categories in which the product will be used as an ingredient with information on the prioritization of the use;</P>
              <P>(7) The population group for which the product will be offered for use (e.g., infants, children under 4 years of age);</P>
              <P>(8) The names of the most closely related products (or in the case of foods for special dietary use and imitation or substitute foods, the names of the products for which they are offered as substitutes);</P>
              <P>(9) The suggested reference amount (the amount of edible portion of food as consumed, excluding bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components) for the population group for which the product is intended with full description of the methodology and procedures that were used to determine the suggested reference amount. In determining the reference amount, general principles and factors in paragraph (a) of this section should be followed.</P>

              <P>(10) The suggested reference amount shall be expressed in metric units. Reference amounts for fluids shall be expressed in milliliters. Reference amounts for other foods shall be expressed in grams except when common household units such as cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons, are more appropriate or are more likely to promote uniformity in serving sizes declared on product labels. For example, common household measures would be more appropriate if products within the same category differ substantially in density, such as frozen desserts.<PRTPAGE P="87"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) In expressing the reference amounts in milliliters, the following rules shall be followed:</P>
              <P>(A) For volumes greater than 30 milliliters (mL), the volume shall be expressed in multiples of 30 mL.</P>
              <P>(B) For volumes less than 30 mL, the volume shall be expressed in milliliters equivalent to a whole number of teaspoons or 1 tbsp, i.e., 5, 10, or 15 mL.</P>
              <P>(ii) In expressing the reference amounts in grams, the following general rules shall be followed:</P>
              <P>(A) For quantities greater than 10 g, the quantity shall be expressed in the nearest 5-g increment.</P>
              <P>(B) For quantities less than 10 g, exact gram weights shall be used.</P>
              <P>(11) A petition to create a new subcategory of food with its own reference amount shall include the following additional information:</P>
              <P>(i) Data that demonstrate that the new subcategory of food will be consumed in amounts that differ enough from the reference amount for the parent category to warrant a separate reference amount. Data must include sample size; and the mean, standard deviation, median, and modal consumed amount per eating occasion for the petitioned product and for other products in the category, excluding the petitioned product. All data must be derived from the same survey data.</P>
              <P>(ii) Documentation supporting the difference in dietary usage and product characteristics that affect the consumption size that distinguishes the petitioned product from the rest of the products in the category.</P>
              <P>(12) A claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter, and</P>
              <P>(13) In conducting research to collect or process food consumption data in support of the petition, the following general guidelines should be followed.</P>
              <P>(i) Sampled population selected should be representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the target population group for which the food is intended.</P>
              <P>(ii) Sample size (i.e., number of eaters) should be large enough to give reliable estimates for customarily consumed amounts.</P>
              <P>(iii) The study protocol should identify potential biases and describe how potential biases are controlled for or, if not possible to control, how they affect interpretation of results.</P>
              <P>(iv) The methodology used to collect or process data should be fully documented and should include: study design, sampling procedures, materials used (e.g., questionnaire, and interviewer's manual), procedures used to collect or process data, methods or procedures used to control for unbiased estimates, and procedures used to correct for nonresponse.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nutrient content claims—general principles.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section and the regulations in subpart D of this part apply to foods that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale, including conventional foods and dietary supplements.</P>
              <P>(b) A claim that expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of a nutrient of the type required to be in nutrition labeling under § 101.9 or under § 101.36 (that is, a nutrient content claim) may not be made on the label or in labeling of foods unless the claim is made in accordance with this regulation and with the applicable regulations in subpart D of this part or in part 105 or part 107 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the food, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”</P>
              <P>(2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:</P>

              <P>(i) Describes the food or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or <PRTPAGE P="88"/>present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or</P>
              <P>(ii) Suggests that the food, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).</P>
              <P>(3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on food intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in parts 101, 105, or 107 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in part 101 and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).</P>
              <P>(5) For dietary supplements, claims for calories, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may not be made on products that meet the criteria in § 101.60(b)(1) or (b)(2) for “calorie free” or “low calorie” claims, except, in the case of calorie claims, when an equivalent amount of a similar dietary supplement (e.g., another protein supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes, normally exceeds the definition for “low calorie” in § 101.60(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) Information that is required or permitted by § 101.9 or § 101.36, as applicable, to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.</P>
              <P>(d) A “substitute” food is one that may be used interchangeably with another food that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”</P>
              <P>(1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the food, the food may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).</P>
              <P>(2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch, unless the package complies with § 101.2(c)(5), in which case the disclaimer may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch.</P>
              <P>(e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a food implies that the food differs from other foods of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only foods that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the food, remove the nutrient from the food, or not include the nutrient in the food, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium potato chips”).</P>
              <P>(2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a food, or that a food is low in a nutrient when the food has not been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the food inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all foods of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “corn oil, a sodium-free food”).</P>
              <P>(f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size no larger than two times the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.</P>
              <P>(g) [Reserved]</P>

              <P>(h)(1) If a food, except a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l), a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), or food intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, contains more than 13.0 g of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per <PRTPAGE P="89"/>reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving, or, for a food with a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50 g criterion refers to the “as prepared” form), then that food must bear a statement disclosing that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food as follows: “See nutrition information for __ content” with the blank filled in with the identity of the nutrient exceeding the specified level, e.g., “See nutrition information for fat content.”</P>
              <P>(2) If a food is a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l), and contains more than 26 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per labeled serving, then that food must disclose, in accordance with the requirements as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food.</P>
              <P>(3) If a food is a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), and contains more than 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled serving, then that food must disclose, in accordance with the requirements as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the nutrient exceeding the specified level is present in the food.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) The disclosure statement “See nutrition information for __ content” shall be in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclosure statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch, unless the package complies with § 101.2(c)(2), in which case the disclosure statement may be in type of not less than one thirty-second of an inch.</P>
              <P>(ii) The disclosure statement shall be immediately adjacent to the nutrient content claim and may have no intervening material other than, if applicable, other information in the statement of identity or any other information that is required to be presented with the claim under this section (e.g., see paragraph (j)(2) of this section) or under a regulation in subpart D of this part (e.g., see §§ 101.54 and 101.62). If the nutrient content claim appears on more than one panel of the label, the disclosure statement shall be adjacent to the claim on each panel except for the panel that bears the nutrition information where it may be omitted.</P>
              <P>(iii) If a single panel of a food label or labeling contains multiple nutrient content claims or a single claim repeated several times, a single disclosure statement may be made. The statement shall be adjacent to the claim that is printed in the largest type on that panel.</P>
              <P>(i) Except as provided in § 101.9 or § 101.36, as applicable, or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of the statement on the food implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the food and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart D of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 3 g of fat per serving;”</P>

              <P>(2) The use of the statement on the food implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the food and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the food is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 mg sodium per serving, not a low sodium food.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 101.7(i) for the net quantity of contents statement except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch unless the package complies with <PRTPAGE P="90"/>§ 101.2(c)(5), in which case the disclaimer may be in type of not less less than one thirty-second of an inch, or</P>
              <P>(3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the food and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.</P>
              <P>(4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 101.62(b)(6).</P>
              <P>(j) A food may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the food with the level of a nutrient in a reference food. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.</P>
              <P>(1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the food must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference food as specified below.</P>
              <P>(i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet (e.g., potato chips as reference for pretzels, orange juice as a reference for vitamin C tablets) or a similar food (e.g., potato chips as reference for potato chips, one brand of multivitamin as reference for another brand of multivitamin).</P>
              <P>(B) For “light,” “reduced,” “added,” “extra,” “plus,” “fortified,” and “enriched” claims, the reference food shall be a similar food (e.g., potato chips as a reference for potato chips, one brand of multivitamin for another brand of multivitamin), and</P>
              <P>(ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference food shall be representative of the type of food that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference food shall be representative of a broad base of foods of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the food type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.</P>
              <P>(B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference food may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting label is internally consistent to (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the food has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.</P>
              <P>(2) For foods bearing relative claims:</P>
              <P>(i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference food by which the nutrient in the labeled food differs (e.g., “50 percent less fat than (reference food)” or “1/3 fewer calories than (reference food)”),</P>
              <P>(ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim. The type size shall be in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:</P>
              <P>(A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;</P>

              <P>(B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;<PRTPAGE P="91"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) A claim on the information panel; or</P>
              <P>(D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.</P>
              <P>(iv) The label or labeling must also bear:</P>
              <P>(A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that in the reference food; and</P>
              <P>(B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient (e.g., 3 g fat or less).</P>
              <P>(k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a food that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “Modified fat cheesecake”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “Contains 35 percent less fat than ___.” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.</P>
              <P>(l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal product shall be defined as a food that:</P>
              <P>(1) Makes a major contribution to the total diet by:</P>
              <P>(i) Weighing at least 10 ounces (oz) per labeled serving; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Containing not less than three 40-g portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group;</P>
              <P>(B) Fruits and vegetables group;</P>
              <P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese group;</P>
              <P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts group; except that;</P>
              <P>(E) These foods shall not be sauces (except for foods in the above four food groups that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings or garnishes; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, or meal. Such representations may be made either by statements, photographs, or vignettes.</P>
              <P>(m) For purposes of making a claim, a “main dish product” shall be defined as a food that:</P>
              <P>(1) Makes a major contribution to a meal by</P>
              <P>(i) Weighing at least 6 oz per labeled serving; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Containing not less than 40 g of food, or combinations of foods, from each of at least two of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(E) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group;</P>
              <P>(B) Fruits and vegetables group;</P>
              <P>(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese group;</P>
              <P>(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts groups; except that:</P>
              <P>(E) These foods shall not be sauces (except for foods in the above four food groups that are in the sauces) gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and</P>
              <P>(2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish (e.g, not a beverage or a dessert). Such representations may be made either by statements, photographs, or vignettes.</P>
              <P>(n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 101.9, § 101.10, or § 101.36, as applicable, shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.</P>
              <P>(o) Except as provided in § 101.10, compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims in this section and in the regulations in subpart D of this part, will be determined using the analytical methodology prescribed for determining compliance with nutrition labeling in § 101.9.</P>

              <P>(p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 101.12(b) through (f) shall be used in determining whether a <PRTPAGE P="92"/>product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 101.12(g) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 240 milliliters (8 fl oz.)”).</P>
              <P>(2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size in accordance with paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(q) The following exemptions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that are contained in the brand name of a specific food product that was the brand name in use on such food before October 25, 1989, may continue to be used as part of that brand name for such product, provided that they are not false or misleading under section 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). However, foods bearing such claims must comply with section 403(f), (g), and (h) of the act;</P>
              <P>(2) A soft drink that used the term <E T="03">diet</E> as part of its brand name before October 25, 1989, and whose use of that term was in compliance with § 105.66 of this chapter as that regulation appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations on that date, may continue to use that term as part of its brand name, provided that its use of the term is not false or misleading under section 403(a) of the act. Such claims are exempt from the requirements of section 403(r)(2) of the act (e.g., the disclosure statement also required by § 101.13(h)). Soft drinks marketed after October 25, 1989, may use the term “diet” provided they are in compliance with the current § 105.66 of this chapter and the requirements of § 101.13.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 101.9 may be made on the label or in labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral unless such claim is expressly prohibited by regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(vi) of the act.</P>
              <P>(ii) Percentage claims for dietary supplements. Under section 403(r)(2)(F) of the act, a statement that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which a reference daily intake (RDI) or daily reference value (DRV) has not been established may be made on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements without a regulation that specifically defines such a statement. All such claims shall be accompanied by any disclosure statement required under paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Simple percentage claims.</E> Whenever a statement is made that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV, the statement of the actual amount of the dietary ingredient per serving shall be declared next to the percentage statement (e.g., “40 percent omega-3 fatty acids, 10 mg per capsule”).</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Comparative percentage claims.</E> Whenever a statement is made that characterizes the percentage level of a dietary ingredient for which there is no RDI or DRV and the statement draws a comparison to the amount of the dietary ingredient in a reference food, the reference food shall be clearly identified, the amount of that food shall be identified, and the information on the actual amount of the dietary ingredient in both foods shall be declared in accordance with paragraph (j)(2)(iv) of this section (e.g., “twice the omega-3 fatty acids per capsule (80 mg) as in 100 mg of menhaden oil (40 mg)”).</P>
              <P>(4) The requirements of this section do not apply to:</P>
              <P>(i) Infant formulas subject to section 412(h) of the act; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Medical foods defined by section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act.</P>

              <P>(5) A nutrient content claim used on food that is served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or use in such establishments shall comply with the requirements of this section and <PRTPAGE P="93"/>the appropriate definition in subpart D of this part, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) Such claim is exempt from the requirements for disclosure statements in paragraph (h) of this section and §§ 101.54(d), 101.62(c), (d)(1)(ii)(D), (d)(2)(iii)(C), (d)(3), (d)(4)(ii)(C), and (d)(5)(ii)(C); and</P>
              <P>(ii) In lieu of analytical testing, compliance may be determined using a reasonable basis for concluding that the food that bears the claim meets the definition for the claim. This reasonable basis may derive from recognized data bases for raw and processed foods, recipes, and other means to compute nutrient levels in the foods or meals and may be used provided reasonable steps are taken to ensure that the method of preparation adheres to the factors on which the reasonable basis was determined (e.g., types and amounts of ingredients, cooking temperatures, etc.). Firms making claims on foods based on this reasonable basis criterion are required to provide to appropriate regulatory officials on request the specific information on which their determination is based and reasonable assurance of operational adherence to the preparation methods or other basis for the claim; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A term or symbol that may in some contexts constitute a claim under this section may be used, provided that the use of the term or symbol does not characterize the level of a nutrient, and a statement that clearly explains the basis for the use of the term or symbol is prominently displayed and does not characterize the level of a nutrient. For example, a term such as “lite fare” followed by an asterisk referring to a note that makes clear that in this restaurant “lite fare” means smaller portion sizes than normal; or an item bearing a symbol referring to a note that makes clear that this item meets the criteria for the dietary guidance established by a recognized dietary authority would not be considered a nutrient content claim under § 101.13.</P>
              <P>(6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the common or usual names of foods that were subject to a standard of identity on November 8, 1990, are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section or to definitions in subpart D of this part.</P>
              <P>(7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration. Petitions requesting approval of such a claim may be submitted under § 101.69(o).</P>
              <P>(8) The term <E T="03">fluoridated, fluoride added</E> or <E T="03">with added fluoride</E> may be used on the label or in labeling of bottled water that contains added fluoride.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: general requirements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Health claim</E> means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly or by implication, including “third party” references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as “heart”), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition. Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance in the food and a disease or health-related condition.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Substance</E> means a specific food or component of food, regardless of whether the food is in conventional food form or a dietary supplement that includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Nutritive value</E> means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients, or providing energy.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Disqualifying nutrient levels</E> means the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a food above <PRTPAGE P="94"/>which the food will be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13.0 grams (g) of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium, per reference amount customarily consumed, per label serving size, and, only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated foods that must have water added to them prior to typical consumption, the per 50-g criterion refers to the as prepared form. Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per label serving size or, when applicable, a per 50 g basis, will disqualify a food from making a health claim unless an exception is provided in subpart E of this part, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) The levels for a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l) are 26.0 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per label serving size, and</P>
              <P>(ii) The levels for a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m) are 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per label serving size.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Disease or health-related condition</E> means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition (claims pertaining to such diseases are thereby not subject to § 101.14 or § 101.70).</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Eligibility.</E> For a substance to be eligible for a health claim:</P>
              <P>(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population, or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the petition submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a conventional food at decreased dietary levels, the substance must be a nutrient listed in 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(C) or (q)(1)(D), or one that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required to be included in the label or labeling under 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(2)(A); or</P>
              <P>(3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels:</P>
              <P>(i) The substance must, regardless of whether the food is a conventional food or a dietary supplement, contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any other technical effect listed in § 170.3(o) of this chapter, to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim, to FDA's satisfaction, to be safe and lawful under the applicable food safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Validity requirement.</E> FDA will promulgate regulations authorizing a health claim only when it determines, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant scientific agreement, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">General health claim labeling requirements.</E> (1) When FDA determines that a health claim meets the validity requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, FDA will propose a regulation in subpart E of this part to authorize the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in § 101.9 or § 101.36, FDA will propose amending that regulation to include declaration of the substance.</P>

              <P>(2) When FDA has adopted a regulation in subpart E of this part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on the regulation in subpart E of this part, provided that:<PRTPAGE P="95"/>
              </P>
              <P>(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in the regulations in subpart E of this part;</P>
              <P>(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition;</P>
              <P>(iii) The claim is complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific regulation in subpart E of this part;</P>
              <P>(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material, except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, “See ___ for information about the relationship between ___ and ___,” with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., “See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis”), with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling, Provided that, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such graphic material;</P>
              <P>(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet; and</P>

              <P>(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the term <E T="03">low</E> has been established for that substance under this part, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in subpart E of this part. If no definition for “low” has been established, the level of the substance must meet the level established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or</P>

              <P>(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance is sufficiently high and in an appropriate form to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the term <E T="03">high</E> for that substance has been established under this part, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in subpart E of this part. If no definition for “high” has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; <E T="03">Provided</E> That:</P>
              <P>(A) Where the food that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather than the labeled serving size (e.g., “Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many factors. A serving of _ ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.”).</P>
              <P>(B) Where the food that bears the claim is sold in a restaurant or in other establishments in which food that is ready for immediate human consumption is sold, the food can meet the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section if the firm that sells the food has a reasonable basis on which to believe that the food that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii) of this section and provides that basis upon request.</P>

              <P>(2) The claim conforms to all general provisions of this section as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate section of subpart E of this part;</P>
              <P>(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the food, unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in subpart E of this part; or unless FDA has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present in the food based on a finding that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, and, in accordance with the regulation in subpart E of this part that makes such a finding, the label bears a disclosure statement that complies with § 101.13(h), highlighting the nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying level;</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined in the specific provision authorizing the claim in subpart E of this part;</P>

              <P>(a) A word, statement, or other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and conspicuousness required by section 403(f) of the act by reason (among other reasons) of:</P>
              <P>(1) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on the part or panel of the label which is presented or displayed under customary conditions of purchase;</P>
              <P>(2) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient space therefor, and each of which is so designed as to render it likely to be, under customary conditions of purchase, the part or panel displayed;</P>
              <P>(3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the container or package available for such extension, so as to provide sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information;</P>
              <P>(4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;</P>

              <P>(5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space to give materially greater conspicuousness to any <PRTPAGE P="97"/>other word, statement, or information, or to any design or device; or</P>
              <P>(6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic matter.</P>
              <P>(b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403 (e) or (i) of the act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:</P>
              <P>(1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label;</P>
              <P>(2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any word, statement, or other information than is required by section 403(f) of the act; or</P>
              <P>(3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign language.</P>

              <P>(c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That in the case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a Territory where the predominant language is one other than English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.</P>

              <P>(2) If the label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the foreign language: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That individual serving-size packages of foods containing no more than 1<FR>1/2</FR> avoirdupois ounces or no more than 1<FR>1/2</FR> fluid ounces served with meals in restaurants, institutions, and passenger carriers and not intended for sale at retail are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (c)(2), if the only representation in the foreign language(s) is the name of the food.</P>
              <P>(3) If any article of labeling (other than a label) contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear on such article of labeling.</P>

              <P>(5) The safe handling statement for shell eggs that are not for direct sale to consumers, e.g., those that are to be repacked or labeled at a site other than where originally processed, or are sold for use in food service establishments, may be provided on cartons or in labeling, e.g., invoices or bills of lading in accordance with the practice of the trade.</P>
              <P>(6) Under sections 311 and 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), any State or locality that is willing and able to assist the agency in the enforcement of paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section, and is authorized to inspect or regulate establishments handling packed shell eggs, may in its own jurisdiction, enforce paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section through inspections under paragraph (h)(8) of this section and through administrative enforcement remedies identified in paragraph (h)(7) of this section until FDA notifies the State or locality in writing that such assistance is no longer needed. When providing such assistance, a State or locality may follow the hearing procedures set out in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(C) through (h)(7)(ii)(D) of this section, substituting, where necessary, appropriate State or local officials for designated FDA officials or may utilize State or local hearing procedures if such procedures satisfy due process.</P>
              <P>(7) This paragraph (h) is established under authority of both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and the PHS Act. Under the act, the agency can enforce the food misbranding provisions under 21 U.S.C. 331, 332, 333, and 334. However, 42 U.S.C. 264 provides for the issuance of implementing enforcement regulations; therefore, FDA has established the following administrative enforcement procedures for the relabeling, diversion, or destruction of shell eggs and informal hearings under the PHS Act:</P>

              <P>(i) Upon finding that any shell eggs are in violation of this section an authorized FDA representative or State or local representative in accordance with paragraph (h)(6) of this section may order such eggs to be relabeled under the supervision of said representative, diverted, under the supervision of said representative for processing in accordance with the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031 <E T="03">et seq.</E>), or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of the FDA, or, if applicable, of the State or locality, in accordance with the following procedures:</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Order for relabeling, diversion, or destruction under the PHS Act.</E> Any division office of FDA or any State or locality acting under paragraph (h)(6) of this section, upon finding shell eggs held in violation of this section, may serve upon the person in whose possession such eggs are found a written order that such eggs be relabeled with the required statement in paragraph (h)(1) of this section before further distribution. If the person chooses not to relabel, the division office of FDA or, if applicable, the appropriate State or local agency may serve upon the person a written order that such eggs be diverted (from direct consumer sale, <E T="03">e.g.,</E> to food service) under the supervision of an officer or employee of the issuing entity, for processing in accordance with the EPIA (21 U.S.C. 1031 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or destroyed by or under the supervision of the issuing entity, within <PRTPAGE P="101"/>10 working days from the date of receipt of the order.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Issuance of order.</E> The order shall include the following information:</P>

              <P>(<E T="03">9</E>) A statement that the order may be appealed by written appeal or by requesting an informal hearing;</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">10</E>) The name and phone number of the person issuing the order; and</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">11</E>) The location and telephone number of the responsible office or agency and the name of its director.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Approval of director.</E> An order, before issuance, shall be approved by the director of the office or agency issuing the order. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval shall be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum as soon as possible.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Labeling or marking of shell eggs under order.</E> An FDA, State, or local representative issuing an order under paragraph (h)(7)(i)(A) of this section shall label or mark the shell eggs with official tags that include the following information:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) A statement that the shell eggs are detained in accordance with regulations issued under section 361(a) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264(a)).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) A statement that the shell eggs shall not be sold, distributed or otherwise disposed of or moved except, after notifying the issuing entity in writing, to:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">i</E>) Relabel, divert them for processing in accordance with the EPIA, or destroy them, or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">ii</E>) Move them to another location for holding pending appeal.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) A statement that the violation of the order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 368 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 271).</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The order number and the date of the order, and the name of the government representative who issued the order.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Sale or other disposition of shell eggs under order.</E> After service of the order, the person in possession of the shell eggs that are the subject of the order shall not sell, distribute, or otherwise dispose of or move any eggs subject to the order unless and until the notice is withdrawn after an appeal except, after notifying FDA's division office or, if applicable, the State or local agency in writing, to:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Relabel, divert, or destroy them as specified in paragraph (h)(7)(i) of this section, or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Move them to another location for holding pending appeal.</P>
              <P>(ii) The person on whom the order for relabeling, diversion, or destruction is served may either comply with the order or appeal the order to an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director.</P>
              <P>(A) <E T="03">Appeal of a detention order.</E> Any appeal shall be submitted in writing to the FDA Division Director in whose division the shell eggs are located within 5 working days of the issuance of the order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, the hearing shall be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or, if requested by the appellant, at a later date, which shall not be later than 20 calendar days after the issuance of the order. The order may also be appealed within the same period of 5 working days by any other person having an ownership or proprietary interest in such shell eggs. The appellant of an order shall state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the shell eggs.</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Summary decision.</E> A request for a hearing may be denied, in whole or in part and at any time after a request for a hearing has been submitted, if the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact has been raised by the material submitted in connection with the <PRTPAGE P="102"/>hearing or from matters officially noticed. If the presiding FDA official determines that a hearing is not justified, written notice of the determination will be given to the parties explaining the reason for denial.</P>
              <P>(C) <E T="03">Informal hearing.</E> Appearance by any appellant at the hearing may be by mail or in person, with or without counsel. The informal hearing shall be conducted by an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director, and a written summary of the proceedings shall be prepared by the presiding FDA official.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) The presiding FDA official may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and this section. The presiding FDA official has the power to take such actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and to conduct an informal, fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements concerning the conduct of hearings.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the information and reasons supporting it, and may present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing may then present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. All parties may conduct reasonable examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but any party may comment upon or rebut any information and views presented by another party.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">4</E>) The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with the presiding FDA official's report of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">5</E>) The presiding FDA official shall prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the presiding FDA official may give the parties the opportunity to review and comment on the report of the hearing.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">6</E>) The presiding FDA official shall include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and shall include a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons.</P>
              <P>(D) <E T="03">Written appeal.</E> If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a hearing, the presiding FDA official shall render a decision on the appeal affirming or revoking the detention within 5-working days after the receipt of the appeal.</P>
              <P>(E) <E T="03">Presiding FDA official's decision.</E> If, based on the evidence presented at the hearing or by the appellant in a written appeal, the presiding FDA official finds that the shell eggs were held in violation of this section, he shall affirm the order that they be relabeled, diverted under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA for processing under the EPIA, or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA; otherwise, the presiding FDA official shall issue a written notice that the prior order is withdrawn. If the presiding FDA official affirms the order, he shall order that the relabeling, diversion, or destruction be accomplished within 10-working days from the date of the issuance of his decision. The presiding FDA official's decision shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision. The decision of the presiding FDA official shall constitute final agency action, reviewable in the courts.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">No appeal.</E> If there is no appeal of the order and the person in possession of the shell eggs that are subject to the order fails to relabel, divert, or destroy them within 10 working days, or if the demand is affirmed by the presiding FDA official after an appeal and the person in possession of such eggs fails to relabel, divert, or destroy them within 10 working days, the FDA division office, or, if applicable, the State or local agency may designate an officer or employee to divert or destroy <PRTPAGE P="103"/>such eggs. It shall be unlawful to prevent or to attempt to prevent such diversion or destruction of the shell eggs by the designated officer or employee.</P>
              <P>(8) Persons engaged in handling or storing packed shell eggs for retail distribution shall permit authorized representatives of FDA to make at any reasonable time such inspection of the establishment in which shell eggs are being held, including inspection and sampling of the labeling of such eggs as may be necessary in the judgment of such representatives to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. Inspections may be made with or without notice and will ordinarily be made during regular business hours.</P>
              <P>(9) No State or local governing entity shall establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement requiring safe handling instructions on unpasteurized shell eggs that are less stringent than those required in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(5) of this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings and chemical preservatives.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) The term <E T="03">artificial flavor</E> or <E T="03">artificial flavoring</E> means any substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in §§ 172.515(b) and 182.60 of this chapter except where these are derived from natural sources.</P>
              <P>(2) The term <E T="03">spice</E> means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in § 182.10 and part 184 of this chapter, such as the following:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, <PRTPAGE P="104"/>Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, Turmeric.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <FP>Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, shall be declared as “spice and coloring” unless declared by their common or usual name.</FP>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">natural flavor</E> or <E T="03">natural flavoring</E> means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in §§ 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, and 182.50 and part 184 of this chapter, and the substances listed in § 172.510 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(4) The term <E T="03">artificial color</E> or <E T="03">artificial coloring</E> means any “color additive” as defined in § 70.3(f) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(5) The term <E T="03">chemical preservative</E> means any chemical that, when added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or herbicidal properties.</P>
              <P>(b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package form.</P>
              <P>(c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative shall be placed on the food or on its container or wrapper, or on any two or all three of these, as may be necessary to render such statement likely to be read by the ordinary person under customary conditions of purchase and use of such food. The specific artificial color used in a food shall be identified on the labeling when so required by regulation in part 74 of this chapter to assure safe conditions of use for the color additive.</P>
              <P>(d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.</P>
              <P>(e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(k).</P>
              <P>(f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical prior to harvest.</P>
              <P>(g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be labeled as provided in the standard:</P>
              <P>(1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared by its common or usual name.</P>

              <P>(2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may state “All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.” Any flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.<PRTPAGE P="105"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “strawberry flavor”, “banana flavor”, or “natural strawberry flavor”. In cases where the flavor contains both a natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “natural and artificial strawberry flavor”. In cases where the flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., “artificial strawberry flavor”.</P>
              <P>(h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:</P>
              <P>(1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as “spice”, “natural flavor”, or “artificial flavor”, or any combination thereof, as the case may be.</P>
              <P>(2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of § 101.100(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.</P>
              <P>(4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name “salt.”</P>
              <P>(5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be declared by its common or usual name “monosodium glutamate.”</P>
              <P>(6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as an ingredient in a food may be declared as artificial flavor or artificial smoke flavor. No representation may be made, either directly or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked flavor.</P>
              <P>(7) Because protein hydrolysates function in foods as both flavorings and flavor enhancers, no protein hydrolysate used in food for its effects on flavor may be declared simply as “flavor,” “natural flavor,” or “flavoring.” The ingredient shall be declared by its specific common or usual name as provided in § 102.22 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary recognizable flavor(s), by word, vignette, e.g., depiction of a fruit, or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the following way:</P>
              <P>(1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “vanilla”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food, except that:</P>
              <P>(i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a characterizing food ingredient, e.g., strawberries in “strawberry shortcake”, and the food contains natural flavor derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food contains no such ingredient, the name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the word “natural” and shall be immediately followed by the word “flavored” in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “natural strawberry flavored shortcake,” or “strawberry flavored shortcake”.</P>

              <P>(ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which the flavor is derived or as “artificially flavored.”<PRTPAGE P="106"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately followed by the words “with other natural flavor” in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the characterizing flavor.</P>
              <P>(2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s) “artificial” or “artificially flavored”, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “artificial vanilla”, “artificially flavored strawberry”, or “grape artificially flavored”.</P>
              <P>(3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, except:</P>
              <P>(i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing flavors present in such food, e.g., “artificially flavored vanilla and strawberry”.</P>
              <P>(iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor, e.g., “artificially flavored fruit punch”.</P>
              <P>(4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A flavor user shall be required to make such a written certification only where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the flavor is supplied and for a minimum of three years thereafter, and shall be subject to the following conditions:</P>
              <P>(i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized office or employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying party to the penalties for making any false report to the government under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under section 303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this section.</P>

              <P>(ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made pursuant to this section, constituting a representative <PRTPAGE P="107"/>sample of such certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.</P>

              <P>(iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records ready for verification as soon as practicable: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, whenever the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during such period.</P>
              <P>(iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be verified.</P>

              <P>(v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.</P>
              <P>(j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, except when exempt pursuant to § 101.100 bear a label declaration stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g., “preservative”, “to retard spoilage”, “a mold inhibitor”, “to help protect flavor” or “to promote color retention”.</P>
              <P>(k) The label of a food to which any coloring has been added shall declare the coloring in the statement of ingredients in the manner specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, except that colorings added to butter, cheese, and ice cream, if declared, may be declared in the manner specified in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, and colorings added to foods subject to §§ 105.62 and 105.65 of this chapter shall be declared in accordance with the requirements of those sections.</P>
              <P>(1) A color additive or the lake of a color additive subject to certification under 721(c) of the act shall be declared by the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter, except that it is not necessary to include the “FD&amp;C” prefix or the term “No.” in the declaration, but the term “Lake” shall be included in the declaration of the lake of the certified color additive (e.g., Blue 1 Lake). Manufacturers may parenthetically declare an appropriate alternative name of the certified color additive following its common or usual name as specified in part 74 or part 82 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) Color additives not subject to certification and not otherwise required by applicable regulations in part 73 of this chapter to be declared by their respective common or usual names may be declared as “Artificial Color,” “Artificial Color Added,” or “Color Added” (or by an equally informative term that makes clear that a color additive has been used in the food). Alternatively, such color additives may be declared as “Colored with ________” or “________ color,” the blank to be filled in with the name of the color additive listed in the applicable regulation in part 73 of this chapter.<PRTPAGE P="108"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) When a coloring has been added to butter, cheese, or ice cream, it need not be declared in the ingredient list unless such declaration is required by a regulation in part 73 or part 74 of this chapter to ensure safe conditions of use for the color additive. Voluntary declaration of all colorings added to butter, cheese, and ice cream, however, is recommended.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 101.30</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Percentage juice declaration for foods purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juice.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) This section applies to any food that purports to be a beverage that contains any fruit or vegetable juice (i.e., the product's advertising, label, or labeling bears the name of, or variation on the name of, or makes any other direct or indirect representation with respect to, any fruit or vegetable juice), or the label or labeling bears any vignette (i.e., depiction of a fruit or vegetable) or other pictorial representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product contains color and flavor that gives the beverage the appearance and taste of containing a fruit or vegetable juice. The beverage may be carbonated or noncarbonated, concentrated, full-strength, diluted, or contain no juice. For example, a soft drink (soda) that does not represent or suggest by its physical characteristics, name, labeling, ingredient statement, or advertising that it contains fruit or vegetable juice does not purport to contain juice and therefore does not require a percent juice declaration.</P>
              <P>(b)(1) If the beverage contains fruit or vegetable juice, the percentage shall be declared by the words “Contains _ percent (or %) ___ juice” or “_ percent (or %) juice,” or a similar phrase, with the first blank filled in with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the actual percentage of the juice and the second blank (if used) filled in with the name of the particular fruit or vegetable (e.g., “Contains 50 percent apple juice” or “50 percent juice”).</P>
              <P>(2) If the beverage contains less than 1 percent juice, the total percentage juice shall be declared as “less than 1 percent juice” or “less than 1 percent ___ juice” with the blank filled in with the name of the particular fruit or vegetable.</P>
              <P>(3) If the beverage contains 100 percent juice and also contains non-juice ingredients that do not result in a diminution of the juice soluble solids or, in the case of expressed juice, in a change in the volume, when the 100 percent juice declaration appears on a panel of the label that does not also bear the ingredient statement, it must be accompanied by the phrase “with added ___,” the blank filled in with a term such as “ingredient(s),” “preservative,” or “sweetener,” as appropriate (e.g., “100% juice with added sweetener”), except that when the presence of the non-juice ingredient(s) is declared as a part of the statement of identity of the product, this phrase need not accompany the 100 percent juice declaration.</P>
              <P>(c) If a beverage contains minor amounts of juice for flavoring and is labeled with a flavor description using terms such as “flavor”, “flavored”, or “flavoring” with a fruit or vegetable name and does not bear:</P>
              <P>(1) The term “juice” on the label other than in the ingredient statement; or</P>
              <P>(2) An explicit vignette depicting the fruit or vegetable from which the flavor derives, such as juice exuding from a fruit or vegetable; or</P>
              <P>(3) Specific physical resemblance to a juice or distinctive juice characteristic such as pulp then total percentage juice declaration is not required.</P>

              <P>(d) If the beverage does not meet the criteria for exemption from total juice percentage declaration as described in paragraph (c) of this section and contains no fruit or vegetable juice, but the labeling or color and flavor of the beverage represents, suggests, or implies that fruit or vegetable juice may be present (e.g., the product advertising or labeling bears the name, a variation of the name, or a pictorial representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product contains color and flavor that give the beverage the appearance and taste of containing a <PRTPAGE P="109"/>fruit or vegetable juice), then the label shall declare “contains zero (0) percent (or %) juice”. Alternatively, the label may declare “Containing (or contains) no ___ juice”, or “no ___ juice”, or “does not contain ___ juice”, the blank to be filled in with the name of the fruits or vegetables represented, suggested, or implied, but if there is a general suggestion that the product contains fruit or vegetable juice, such as the presence of fruit pulp, the blank shall be filled in with the word “fruit” or “vegetable” as applicable (e.g., “contains no fruit juice”, or “does not contain fruit juice”).</P>
              <P>(e) If the beverage is sold in a package with an information panel as defined in § 101.2, the declaration of amount of juice shall be prominently placed on the information panel in lines generally parallel to other required information, appearing:</P>
              <P>(1) Near the top of the information panel, with no other printed label information appearing above the statement except the brand name, product name, logo, or universal product code; and</P>
              <P>(2) In easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, in a height not less than the largest type found on the information panel except that used for the brand name, product name, logo, universal product code, the title phrase “Nutrition Facts,” the declaration of “Serving size,” “Calories” and the numerical value for “Calories appearing in the nutrition information as required by § 101.9.</P>
              <P>(f) The percentage juice declaration may also be placed on the principal display panel, provided that the declaration is consistent with that presented on the information panel.</P>
              <P>(g) If the beverage is sold in a package that does not bear an information panel as defined in § 101.2, the percentage juice declaration shall be placed on the principal display panel, in type size not less than that required for the declaration of net quantity of contents statement in § 101.7(i), and be placed near the name of the food.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) In enforcing these regulations, the Food and Drug Administration will calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix levels listed below where single-strength (100 percent) juice has at least the specified minimum Brix listed below:</P>

              <P>(i) Juices directly expressed from a fruit or vegetable (i.e., not concentrated and reconstituted) shall be considered to be 100 percent juice and shall be declared as “100 percent juice.”</P>
              <P>(j) Calculations of the percentage of juice in a juice blend or a diluted juice product made directly from expressed juice (i.e., not from concentrate) shall be based on the percentage of the expressed juice in the product computed on a volume/volume basis.</P>
              <P>(k) If the product is a beverage that contains a juice whose color, taste, or other organoleptic properties have been modified to the extent that the original juice is no longer recognizable at the time processing is complete, or if its nutrient profile has been diminished to a level below the normal nutrient range for the juice, then that juice to which such a major modification has been made shall not be included in the total percentage juice declaration.</P>
              <P>(l) A beverage required to bear a percentage juice declaration on its label, that contains less than 100 percent juice, shall not bear any other percentage declaration that describes the juice content of the beverage in its label or in its labeling (e.g., “100 percent natural” or “100 percent pure”). However, the label or labeling may bear percentage statements clearly unrelated to juice content (e.g., “provides 100 percent of U.S. RDA of vitamin C”).</P>
              <P>(m) Products purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or vegetable juices are exempted from the provisions of this section until May 8, 1994. All products that are labeled on or after that date shall comply with this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nutrition labeling of dietary supplements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The label of a dietary supplement that is offered for sale shall bear nutrition labeling in accordance with this regulation unless an exemption is provided for the product in paragraph (h) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The declaration of nutrition information on the label and in labeling shall contain the following information, using the subheadings and the format specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Serving size.</E> (i) The subheading “Serving Size” shall be placed under the heading “Supplement Facts” and aligned on the left side of the nutrition label. The serving size shall be determined in accordance with §§ 101.9(b) and 101.12(b), Table 2. Serving size for dietary supplements shall be expressed using a term that is appropriate for the form of the supplement, such as “tablets,” “capsules,” “packets,” or “teaspoonfuls.”</P>
              <P>(ii) The subheading “Servings Per Container” shall be placed under the subheading “Serving Size” and aligned on the left side of the nutrition label, except that this information need not be provided when it is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Information on dietary ingredients that have a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or a Daily Reference Value (DRV) as established in § 101.9(c) and their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as “(b)(2)-dietary ingredients”).</E> (i) The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients to be declared, that is, total calories, total fat, saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium, shall be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with § 101.9(c). Calories from saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, and sugar alcohol may be declared, but they shall be declared when a claim is made about them. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients that are not present, or that are present in amounts that can be declared as zero in <PRTPAGE P="111"/>§ 101.9(c), shall not be declared (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals). Protein shall not be declared on labels of products that, other than ingredients added solely for technological reasons, contain only individual amino acids.</P>
              <P>(A) The names and the quantitative amounts by weight of each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient shall be presented under the heading “Amount Per Serving.” When the quantitative amounts by weight are presented in a separate column, the heading may be centered over a column of quantitative amounts, described by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if space permits. A heading consistent with the declaration of the serving size, such as “Each Tablet Contains,” or “Amount Per 2 Tablets” may be used in place of the heading “Amount Per Serving.” Other appropriate terms, such as capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, also may be used in place of the term “Serving.”</P>

              <P>(B) The names of dietary ingredients that are declared under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be presented in a column aligned on the left side of the nutritional label in the order and manner of indentation specified in § 101.9(c), except that calcium and iron shall follow choline, and sodium and potassium shall follow chloride. This results in the following order for vitamins and minerals: Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate and folic acid, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, potassium, and fluoride. The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients shall be listed according to the nomenclature specified in § 101.9 or in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(<E T="03">2</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) When “Calories” are declared, they shall be listed first in the column of names, beneath a light bar separating the heading “Amount Per Serving” from the list of names. When “Calories from saturated fat” are declared, they shall be indented under “Calories.”</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) The following synonyms may be added in parentheses immediately following the name of these (b)(2)-dietary ingredients: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B<E T="52">1</E>), riboflavin (vitamin B<E T="52">2</E>), and calories (energy). Energy content per serving may be expressed in kilojoule units, added in parentheses immediately following the statement of caloric content.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">3</E>) Beta-carotene may be declared as the percent of vitamin A that is present as beta-carotene, except that the declaration is required when a claim is made about beta-carotene. When declared, the percent shall be declared to the nearest whole percent, immediately adjacent to or beneath the name vitamin A (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Vitamin A (90% as beta-carotene)”). The amount of beta-carotene in terms of micrograms (mcg) may be included in the parentheses following the percent statement (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Vitamin A (90% (810 mcg) as beta-carotene)”).</P>
              <P>(ii) The number of calories, if declared, and the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient required to be listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be presented either in a separate column aligned to the right of the column of names or immediately following the listing of names within the same column. The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient (e.g., the weight of calcium rather than that of calcium carbonate).</P>
              <P>(A) The amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in § 101.9(c)(1) through (7), which includes increments for sodium.</P>

              <P>(B) The amounts of vitamins and minerals, excluding sodium, shall be the amount of the vitamin or mineral included in one serving of the product, using the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the RDI for zinc is given in whole milligrams (mg), but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of a mg). The amount of vitamin D may, but is not <PRTPAGE P="112"/>required to, be expressed in IUs, in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of vitamin D in IUs must appear in parentheses after the declaration of the amount of vitamin D in mcg.</P>

              <P>(iii) The percent of the Daily Value of all dietary ingredients declared under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall be listed, except that the percent Daily Value for protein, when present, shall be calculated using the corrected amount of protein as specified in § 101.9(c)(7)(ii); no percent of the Daily Value shall be given for subcomponents for which DRVs or RDIs have not been established (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> total sugars). Additionally, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall be omitted when a food is purported to be for infants through 12 months of age.</P>
              <P>(A) When information on the percent of Daily Values is listed, this information shall be presented in one column aligned under the heading of “% Daily Value” and to the right of the column of amounts. The headings “% Daily Value (DV),” “% DV,” “Percent Daily Value,” or “Percent DV” may be substituted for “% Daily Value.” The heading “% Daily Value” shall be placed on the same line as the heading “Amount Per Serving.” When the acronym “DV” is unexplained in the heading and a footnote is required under (b)(2)(iii)(D), (b)(2)(iii)(F), or (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the footnote shall explain the acronym (e.g. “Daily Value (DV) not established”).</P>
              <P>(B) The percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing the quantitative amount by weight of each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient by the RDI as established in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) or the DRV as established in § 101.9(c)(9) for the specified dietary ingredient and multiplying by 100, except that the percent of Daily Value for protein, when present, shall be calculated as specified in § 101.9(c)(7)(ii). The quantitative amount by weight of each dietary ingredient in this calculation shall be the unrounded amount, except that for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber, the quantitative amount by weight declared on the label (i.e, rounded amount) may be used. The numerical value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).</P>
              <P>(C) The percentages based on RDI's and on DRV's shall be expressed to the nearest whole percent, except that for dietary ingredients for which DRV's have been established, “Less than 1%” or “&lt;1%” shall be used to declare the “% Daily Value” when the quantitative amount of the dietary ingredient by weight is great enough to require that the dietary ingredient be listed, but the amount is so small that the “% Daily Value” when rounded to the nearest percent is zero (e.g., a product that contains 1 gram of total carbohydrate would list the percent Daily Value as “Less than 1%” or “&lt;1%”).</P>
              <P>(D) If the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, or added sugars, a symbol shall follow the value listed for those nutrients that refers to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the bar required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section and inside the box, that is followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” If the product is represented or purported to be for use by children 1 through 3 years of age, and if the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, or added sugars, a symbol shall follow the value listed for those nutrients that refers to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the bar required under paragraph (e)(6) of this section and inside the box, that is followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 1,000 calorie diet.”</P>

              <P>(E) The percent of Daily Value shall be based on RDI or DRV values for adults and children 4 or more years of age, unless the product is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="113"/>
              </P>

              <P>(F) For declared subcomponents that have no DRVs or RDIs, a symbol (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> an asterisk) shall be placed in the “Percent Daily Value” column that shall refer to the same symbol that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label, below the last heavy bar and inside the box, and followed by a statement “Daily Value not established.”</P>
              <P>(G) When calories or calories from saturated fat are declared, the space under the “% DV” column shall be left blank for these items. When there are no other (b)(2)-dietary ingredients listed for which a value must be declared in the “% DV” column, the column may be omitted as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(vii) of this section. When the “% DV” column is not required, but the dietary ingredients listed are subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, the symbol required in that paragraph shall immediately follow the quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient listed under “Amount Per Serving.”</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Information on dietary ingredients for which RDI's and DRV's have not been established.</E> (i) Dietary ingredients for which FDA has not established RDI's or DRV's and that are not subject to regulation under paragraph (b)(2) of this section (hereinafter referred to as “other dietary ingredients”) shall be declared by their common or usual name when they are present in a dietary supplement, in a column that is under the column of names described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section or, as long as the constituents of an other dietary ingredient are not listed, in a linear display, under the heavy bar described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, except that if no (b)(2)-dietary ingredients are declared, other dietary ingredients shall be declared directly beneath the heading “Amount Per Serving” described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) The quantitative amount by weight per serving of other dietary ingredients shall be presented in the same manner as the corresponding information required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section or, when a linear display is used, shall be presented immediately following the name of the other dietary ingredient. The quantitative amount by weight shall be the weight of the other dietary ingredient listed and not the weight of any component, or the source, of that dietary ingredient.</P>
              <P>(A) These amounts shall be expressed using metric measures in appropriate units.</P>
              <P>(B) For any dietary ingredient that is a liquid extract from which the solvent has not been removed, the quantity listed shall be the volume or weight of the total extract. Information on the condition of the starting material shall be indicated when it is fresh and may be indicated when it is dried. Information may be included on the concentration of the dietary ingredient and the solvent used, e.g., “fresh dandelion root extract, x (y:z) in 70% ethanol,” where x is the number of milliliters (mL) or mg of the entire extract, y is the weight of the starting material and z is the volume (mL) of solvent. Where the solvent has been partially removed (not to dryness), the final concentration, when indicated, shall be stated (e.g., if the original extract was 1:5 and 50 percent of the solvent was removed, then the final concentration shall be stated as 1:2.5). Where the name of the solvent used is not included in the nutrition label, it is required to be listed in the ingredient statement in accordance with § 101.4(g).</P>
              <P>(C) For a dietary ingredient that is an extract from which the solvent has been removed, the weight of the ingredient shall be the weight of the dried extract.</P>
              <P>(iii) The constituents of a dietary ingredient described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section may be listed indented under the dietary ingredient and followed by their quantitative amounts by weight per serving, except that dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be listed in accordance with that section. When the constituents of a dietary ingredient described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are listed, all other dietary ingredients shall be declared in a column; however, the constituents themselves may be declared in a column or in a linear display.</P>

              <P>(iv) Other dietary ingredients shall bear a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) in the column under the heading of “% Daily Value” that refers to the same symbol <PRTPAGE P="114"/>placed at the bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement “Daily Value not established,” except that when the heading “% Daily Value” is not used, the symbol shall follow the quantitative amount by weight for each dietary ingredient listed.</P>
              <P>(c) A proprietary blend of dietary ingredients shall be included in the list of dietary ingredients described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and identified by the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name and may be highlighted by bold type. Except as specified in this paragraph, all other requirements for the listing of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements are applicable.</P>
              <P>(1) Dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend that are listed under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be declared in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend that are listed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section (i.e., “other dietary ingredients”) shall be declared in descending order of predominance by weight, in a column or linear fashion, and indented under the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name.</P>
              <P>(3) The quantitative amount by weight specified for the proprietary blend shall be the total weight of all other dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend and shall be placed on the same line to the right of the term “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name underneath the column of amounts described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. A symbol (e.g., asterisk), which refers to the same symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement “Daily Value not established,” shall be placed under the heading “% Daily Value,” if present, or immediately following the quantitative amount by weight for the proprietary blend.</P>
              <P>(4) The sample label shown in paragraph (e)(11)(v) of this section illustrates one method of nutrition labeling a proprietary blend of dietary ingredients.</P>
              <P>(d) The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words “as” or “from”, e.g., “Calcium (as calcium carbonate),” except that manner of presentation is unnecessary when the name of the dietary ingredient (e.g., Oriental ginseng) or its synonym (e.g., ascorbic acid) is itself the source ingredient. When a source ingredient is identified in parentheses within the nutrition label, or when the name of the dietary ingredient or its synonym is the source ingredient, it shall not be required to be listed again in the ingredient statement that appears outside of the nutrition label. When a source ingredient is not identified within the nutrition label, it shall be listed in an ingredient statement in accordance with § 101.4(g), which shall appear outside and immediately below the nutrition label or, if there is insufficient space below the nutrition label, immediately contiguous and to the right of the nutrition label.</P>
              <P>(1) Source ingredients shall be identified in accordance with § 101.4 (i.e., shall be listed by common or usual name, and the listing of botanicals shall specify the part of the plant from which the ingredient is derived) regardless of whether they are listed in an ingredient statement or in the nutrition label.</P>
              <P>(2) When source ingredients are listed within the nutrition label, and two or more are used to provide a single dietary ingredient, all of the sources shall be listed within the parentheses in descending order by weight.</P>
              <P>(3) Representations that the source ingredient conforms to an official compendium may be included either in the nutrition label or in the ingredient list (e.g., “Calcium (as calcium carbonate USP)”).</P>

              <P>(e) Except as provided for small and intermediate sized packages under paragraph (h)(3)(i)(2) of this section, information other than the title, headings, and footnotes shall be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. Type size no smaller than 6 point may be <PRTPAGE P="115"/>used for column headings (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value”) and for footnotes (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet”).</P>
              <P>(1) The title, “Supplement Facts,” shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, unless impractical, shall be set full width of the nutrition label. The title and all headings shall be bolded to distinguish them from other information.</P>
              <P>(2) The nutrition information shall be enclosed in a box by using hairlines.</P>
              <P>(3) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize:</P>
              <P>(i) A single easy-to-read type style,</P>
              <P>(ii) All black or one color type, printed on a white or other neutral contrasting background whenever practical,</P>
              <P>(iii) Upper- and lowercase letters, except that all uppercase lettering may be utilized for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches,</P>
              <P>(iv) At least one point leading (i.e., space between lines of text), and</P>
              <P>(v) Letters that do not touch.</P>
              <P>(4) Except as provided for small and intermediate-sized packages under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, information other than the title, headings, and footnotes shall be in uniform type size no smaller than 8 point. Type size no smaller than 6 point may be used for column headings (e.g., “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value”) and for footnotes (e.g., “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet”).</P>
              <P>(5) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate each dietary ingredient required in paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it, as shown in paragraph (e)(10) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) A heavy bar shall be placed:</P>
              <P>(i) Beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” except that if “Servings Per Container” is not required and, as a result, not declared, the bar shall be placed beneath the subheading “Serving Size,”</P>
              <P>(ii) Beneath the last dietary ingredient to be listed under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, if any, and</P>
              <P>(iii) Beneath the last other dietary ingredient to be listed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if any.</P>
              <P>(7) A light bar shall be placed beneath the headings “Amount Per Serving” and “% Daily Value.”</P>

              <P>(8) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements that differ from each other (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon), the quantitative amounts and percent of Daily Value may be presented as specified in this paragraph in individual nutrition labels or in one aggregate nutrition label as illustrated in paragraph (e)(11)(iii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(9)(i) The quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a “per unit” basis in addition to the “per serving” basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If “per unit” information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the “per serving” information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings.</P>

              <P>(ii) Alternatively, if a recommendation is made in other parts of the label that a dietary supplement be consumed more than once per day, the total quantitative amount by weight (or volume, if permitted) and the percent of Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a “per day” basis in addition to the “per serving” basis required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iv) of this section for other dietary ingredients. If “per day” information is provided, it must be presented in additional columns to the right of the “per serving” information and be clearly identified by appropriate headings and/or be presented in a parenthetical statement as part of the “Serving Size” declaration. A sample illustration for “per day” information in a column format is provided in paragraph <PRTPAGE P="116"/>(e)(11)(viii) of this section. As illustrated, the additional “Per Day” column heading is followed parenthetically by the number of servings recommended per day in other parts of the label (e.g., “Per Day (3 Caplets)”). When the parenthetical statement format following the “Serving Size” declaration is used as an alternative to the column format, the statement must provide no more than simple instructions regarding how to calculate the “per day” amount for the number of servings per day recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., “Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Multiply amounts by 3 for total daily amount)”). When the parenthetical statement format following the “Serving Size” declaration is used in addition to the column format, the statement must provide no more than a simple declaration of the number of servings recommended in other parts of the label (e.g., “Serving Size: 1 Caplet (Total daily amount: 3 caplets per day)”).</P>
              <P>(10) In the interest of uniformity of presentation, FDA urges that the information be presented using the graphic specifications set forth in appendix B to part 101, as applicable.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urges food retailers to provide nutrition information, as provided in § 101.9(c), for raw fruit, vegetables, and fish at the point-of-purchase. If retailers choose to provide such information, they should do so in a manner that conforms to the guidelines in § 101.45.</P>
              <P>(b) In § 101.44, FDA has listed the 20 varieties of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish that are most frequently consumed during a year and to which the guidelines apply.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA has also defined in § 101.43, the circumstances that constitute substantial compliance by food retailers with the guidelines.</P>
              <P>(d) By May 8, 1993, FDA will issue a report on actions taken by food retailers to provide consumers with nutrition information for raw fruit, vegetables, and fish under the guidelines established in § 101.45.</P>
              <P>(1) The report will include a determination of whether there is substantial compliance, as defined in § 101.43, with the guidelines.</P>
              <P>(2) In evaluating substantial compliance, FDA will consider only the 20 varieties of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish most frequently consumed as identified in § 101.44.</P>
              <P>(e) If FDA finds that there is substantial compliance with the guidelines for the nutrition labeling of raw fruit and vegetables or of fish, the agency will so state in the report, and the guidelines will remain in effect. FDA will reevaluate the market place for substantial compliance every 2 years.</P>
              <P>(f) If FDA determines that there is not substantial compliance with the guidelines for raw fruit and vegetables or for raw fish, the agency will at that time issue proposed regulations requiring that any person who offers raw fruit and vegetables or fish to consumers provide, in a manner prescribed by regulations, the nutrition information required by § 101.9. Final regulations would have to be issued 6 months after issuance of proposed regulations, and they would become effective 6 months after the date of their promulgation.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Substantial compliance of food retailers with the guidelines for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will judge a food retailer who sells raw agricultural commodities or raw fish to be in compliance with the guidelines in § 101.45 with respect to raw agricultural commodities if the retailer displays or provides nutrition labeling for at least 90 percent of the raw agricultural commodities listed in § 101.44 that it sells, and with respect to raw fish if the retailer displays or provides nutrition labeling for at least 90 percent of the types of raw fish listed in § 101.44 that it sells. To be in compliance, the nutrition labeling shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Be presented in the store or other type of establishment in a manner that is consistent with § 101.45(a)(1);</P>
              <P>(2) Be presented in content and format that are consistent with § 101.45 (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4); and</P>
              <P>(3) Include data that have been provided by FDA in appendices C and D to part 101 of this chapter, except that the information on potassium is voluntary.</P>
              <P>(b) To determine whether there is substantial compliance by food retailers with the guidelines in § 101.45 for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruit and vegetables and of raw fish, FDA will select a representative sample of 2,000 stores, allocated by store type and size, for raw fruit and vegetables and for raw fish.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA will find that there is substantial compliance with the guidelines in § 101.45 if it finds based on paragraph (a) of this section that at least 60 percent of all stores that are evaluated are in compliance.</P>
              <P>(d) FDA will evaluate substantial compliance separately for raw agricultural commodities and for raw fish.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Guidelines for the voluntary nutrition labeling of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Nutrition labeling for raw fruits, vegetables, and fish listed in § 101.44 should be presented to the public in the following manner:</P>
              <P>(1) Nutrition labeling information should be displayed at the point of purchase by an appropriate means such as by a label affixed to the food or through labeling including shelf labels, signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets that are readily available and in close proximity to the foods. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media.</P>
              <P>(2) Serving sizes should be determined, and nutrients declared, in accordance with § 101.9 (b) and (c), respectively, except that the nutrition labeling data should be based on the raw edible portion for fruits and vegetables and on the cooked edible portion for fish. The methods used to cook fish should be those that do not add fat, breading, or seasoning (e.g., salt or spices).</P>

              <P>(3) When nutrition labeling information is provided for more than one raw fruit, vegetable, or fish on signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, it may be presented in charts with horizontal or vertical columns or as a compilation of individual nutrition labels. Nutrition labeling that is presented in a linear display (see § 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(A)(<E T="03">2</E>)) will not be considered to be in compliance. The heading “Nutrition Facts” must be in a type size larger than all other print in the nutrition label. The required information (i.e., headings, serving sizes, list of nutrients, quantitative amounts by weight (except for vitamins and minerals), and percent of Daily Values (DV's) (except for sugars and protein) must be clearly presented and of sufficient type size and color contrast to be plainly legible, with numeric values for percent of DV highlighted in contrast to the quantitative amounts by weight and hairlines between all nutrients.</P>
              <P>(i) Declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in the nutrition labeling of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.</P>
              <P>(ii) Except for the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,” the footnote required in § 101.9(d)(9) is not required. However, when labeling is provided in brochures, notebooks, leaflets, or similar types of materials, retailers are encouraged to include the footnote.</P>

              <P>(iii) When retailers provide nutrition labeling information for more than one raw fruit or vegetable on signs or posters or in brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, the listings for saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, and cholesterol may be omitted from the charts or individual nutrition labels if a footnote states that most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of these nutrients, but that avocados contain 0.5 gram (g) of saturated fat per ounce (e.g., “Most fruits and vegetables provide negligible amounts of saturated fat, <E T="03">trans</E> fat, and cholesterol; avocados provide 0.5 g of saturated fat per ounce”). The footnote also may contain information about the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat content of avocados.</P>

              <P>(iv) When retailers provide nutrition labeling information for more than one raw fish on signs or posters or in brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, the listings for <E T="03">trans</E> fat, dietary fiber, and sugars may be omitted from the charts or individual nutrition labels if the following footnote is used, “Fish provide negligible amounts of <E T="03">trans</E> fat, dietary fiber, and sugars.”<PRTPAGE P="124"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) When nutrition labeling is provided for individual raw fruits, vegetables, or fish on packages or on signs, posters, brochures, notebooks, or leaflets, it should be displayed in accordance with § 101.9, except that the declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included. For individual labels provided by retailers on signs and posters, the footnote required in § 101.9(d)(9) may be shortened to “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.”</P>

              <P>(b) Nutrition label values provided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in Appendices C and D to part 101 for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish listed in § 101.44 shall be used to ensure uniformity in declared values. FDA will publish proposed updates of the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish and nutrition label data for these foods (or a notice that the data sets have not changed from the previous publication) at least every 4 years in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(1) The agency encourages the submission of data bases with new or additional nutrient data for any of the most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish to the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS-800), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, for review and evaluation. FDA may incorporate these data in the next revision of the nutrition labeling information for the top 20 raw fruits, vegetables, and fish.</P>
              <P>(i) Guidance in the development of data bases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases,” available from the FDA Office of Food Labeling.</P>
              <P>(ii) The submission to FDA should include, but need not be limited to, information on the following: Source of the data (names of investigators, name of organization, place of analyses, dates of analyses), number of samples, sampling design, analytical methods, and statistical treatment of the data. Proposed quantitative label declarations may be included. The proposed values for declaration should be determined in accordance with the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.”</P>
              <P>(2) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) Data bases of nutrient values for raw fruits, vegetables, and fish that are not among the 20 most frequently consumed may be used to develop nutrition labeling values for these foods. This includes data bases of nutrient values for specific varieties, species, or cultivars of raw fruits, vegetables, and fish not specifically identified among the 20 most frequently consumed.</P>
              <P>(1) The food names and descriptions for the fruits, vegetables, and fish should clearly identify these foods as distinct from foods among the most frequently consumed list for which FDA has provided data.</P>
              <P>(2) Guidance in the development of data bases may be found in the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Data Bases.”</P>
              <P>(3) Nutrition labeling values computed from data bases are subject to the compliance provisions of § 101.9(g).</P>
              <P>(i) Compliance with the provisions of § 101.9(g) may be achieved by use of a data base that has been developed following FDA guideline procedures and approved by FDA.</P>
              <P>(A) The submission to FDA for approval should include but need not be limited to information on the following: Source of the data (names of investigators, name of organization, place of analyses, dates of analyses), number of samples, sampling design, analytical methods, statistical treatment of the data, and proposed quantitative label declarations. The values for declaration should be determined in accordance with the “FDA Nutrition Labeling Manual: A Guide for Developing and Using Databases.”</P>

              <P>(B) FDA approval of a data base and nutrition labeling values shall not be considered granted until the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has agreed to all aspects of the data base in writing. Approvals will be in effect for a limited time, e.g., 10 years, and will be eligible for renewal in the absence of significant changes in agricultural or industry practices (e.g., a change occurs in a predominant variety produced). FDA will take steps to revoke <PRTPAGE P="125"/>its approval of the data base and nutrition labeling values if FDA monitoring suggests that the data base or nutrition labeling values are no longer representative of the item sold in this country. Approval requests shall be submitted in accordance with the provision of § 101.30 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(d) <E T="03">“Fiber” claims.</E> (1) If a nutrient content claim is made with respect to the level of dietary fiber, that is, that the product is high in fiber, a good source of fiber, or that the food contains “more” fiber, and the food is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 101.62(b)(2) or, in the case of a meal product, as defined in § 101.13(l), or main dish product, as defined in § 101.13(m), is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 101.62(b)(3), then the label shall disclose the level of total fat per labeled serving.</P>

              <P>(2) The disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim, be in a type size no less than one-half the size of the claim and precede any disclosure statement required under § 101.13(h) (e.g., “contains [<E T="03">x amount</E>] of total fat per serving. See nutrition information for fat content”).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">“More” claims.</E> (1) A relative claim using the terms “more,” “fortified,” “enriched,” “added,” “extra,” and “plus” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary <PRTPAGE P="126"/>fiber, or potassium, except as limited by § 101.13(j)(1)(i) and except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than white bread”); and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Fiber content of white bread is 1 gram (g) per serving; (this product) 3.5 g per serving”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(2) A relative claim using the terms “more,” “fortified,” “enriched,” “added,” “extra,” and “plus” may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber or potassium, except as limited in § 101.13(j)(1)(i), in meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) or main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The food contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI for vitamins or minerals or of the DRV for protein, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of food than an appropriate reference food.</P>
              <P>(ii) Where the claim is based on a nutrient that has been added to the food, that fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter; and</P>
              <P>(iii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient was increased relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 oz than does ‘X brand of product’ ”), and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “The fiber content of ‘X brand of product’ is 2 g per 3 oz. This product contains 4.5 g per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">“High potency” claims.</E> (1)(i) The term “high potency” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods to describe individual vitamins or minerals that are present at 100 percent or more of the RDI per reference amount customarily consumed.</P>
              <P>(ii) When the term “high potency” is used to describe individual vitamins or minerals in a product that contains other nutrients or dietary ingredients, the label or labeling shall clearly identify which vitamin or mineral is described by the term “high potency” (e.g., “Botanical ‘X’ with high potency vitamin E”).</P>
              <P>(2) The term “high potency” may be used on the label or in the labeling of a multiingredient food product to describe the product if the product contains 100 percent or more of the RDI for at least two-thirds of the vitamins and minerals that are listed in § 101.9(c)(8)(iv) and that are present in the product at 2 percent or more of the RDI (e.g., “High potency multivitamin, multimineral dietary supplement tablets”).</P>

              <P>(3) Where compliance with paragraphs (f)(1)(i), (f)(1)(ii), or (f)(2) of this section is based on a nutrient that has <PRTPAGE P="127"/>been added to a food (other than a dietary supplement), that fortification shall be in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in § 104.20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Nutrient content claims using the term “antioxidant.”</E> A nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of antioxidant nutrients present in a food may be used on the label or in the labeling of that food when:</P>
              <P>(1) An RDI has been established for each of the nutrients;</P>
              <P>(2) The nutrients that are the subject of the claim have recognized antioxidant activity; that is, when there exists scientific evidence that, following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, the substance participates in physiological, biochemical, or cellular processes that inactivate free radicals or prevent free radical-initiated chemical reactions;</P>
              <P>(3) The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim is sufficient to qualify for the § 101.54 (b), (c), or (e) claim (e.g., to bear the claim ”high in antioxidant vitamin C,” the product must contain 20 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin C). Beta-carotene may be a subject of the claim when the level of vitamin A present as beta-carotene in the food that bears the claim is sufficient to qualify for the claim. For example, for the claim “good source of antioxidant beta-carotene,” 10 percent or more of the RDI for vitamin A must be present as beta-carotene per reference amount customarily consumed; and</P>
              <P>(4) The names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim are included as part of the claim (e.g., “high in antioxidant vitamins C and E”). Alternatively, when used as part of a nutrient content claim, the term “antioxidant” or “antioxidants” (as in “high in antioxidants”) may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of a product label followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity. The list of nutrients shall appear in letters of a type size height no smaller than the larger of one-half of the type size of the largest nutrient content claim or <FR>1/16</FR> inch.</P>

              <P>(1) It describes some physical or organoleptic attribute of the food such as texture or color and the information (e.g., “light in color” or “light in texture”) so stated, clearly conveys the nature of the product; and</P>
              <P>(2) The attribute (e.g., “color” or “texture”) is in the same style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word “light” and in immediate proximity thereto.</P>
              <P>(f) If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word “light” has been associated, through common use, with a particular food to reflect a physical or organoleptic attribute (e.g., light brown sugar, light corn syrup, or light molasses) to the point where it has become part of the statement of identity, such use of the term “light” shall not be considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this part.</P>
              <P>(g) The term “lightly salted” may be used on a product to which has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1)(i)(B) and (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not “low in sodium” as defined in § 101.61(b)(4), the statement “not a low sodium food,” shall appear adjacent to the nutrition label of the food bearing the claim, or, if the nutrition label is on the information panel, it may appear elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2 and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear on the label or labeling as specified in § 101.13(j)(2).</P>

              <P>(ii) The food contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredient statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states “adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and</P>
              <P>(iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section, or, if a dietary supplement, it meets the definition in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for “low calorie” but is prohibited by §§ 101.13(b)(5) and 101.60(a)(4) from bearing the claim; or</P>
              <P>(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie food,” “not a low calorie food,” or “not for weight control.”</P>
              <P>(2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:</P>
              <P>(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 101.9(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a food, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The food that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and</P>
              <P>(v) The product bears a statement that the food is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the food meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” food) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.</P>
              <P>(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a food, including foods intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a food that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.</P>
              <P>(4) The claims provided for in paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section may be used on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age.</P>
              <P>(5) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l), main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), and dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, provided that:</P>

              <P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>

              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugar differs between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the <PRTPAGE P="132"/>most prominent such claim (e.g., “these corn flakes contain 25 percent less sugar than our sugar coated corn flakes”); and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(6) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section may be used on the label or in the labeling of a meal product as defined in § 101.13(l) and a main dish product as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:</P>

              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two foods are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced sweet and sour shrimp dinner, “25 percent less sugar per 3 oz than our regular sweet and sour shrimp dinner”); and</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>

              <P>(B) The food has a reference amount customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less and contains 140 mg or less sodium per reference amount customarily consumed and per 50 g (for dehydrated foods that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant amount, as defined in § 101.9(f)(1), of all nutrients per reference amount customarily consumed, the per 50-g criterion refers to the “as prepared” form); and</P>
              <P>(ii) If the food meets these conditions without the benefit of special processing, alteration, formulation, or reformulation to vary the sodium content, it is labeled to clearly refer to all foods of its type and not merely to the particular brand to which the label attaches (e.g., “fresh spinach, a low sodium food”); and</P>
              <P>(5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:</P>

              <P>(6) The terms “reduced sodium,” “reduced in sodium,” “sodium reduced,” “less sodium,” “lower sodium,” or “lower in sodium” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods, except meal products as defined in § 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in § 101.13(m), provided that:</P>
              <P>(i) The food contains at least 25 percent less sodium per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food as described in § 101.13(j)(1).</P>
              <P>(ii) As required for § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium differs from the labeled food are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sodium ___, 50 percent less sodium than regular ___”); and</P>

              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sodium in the product per labeled serving with that of the reference food that it replaces <PRTPAGE P="134"/>(e.g., “Sodium content has been lowered from 300 to 150 mg per serving.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section may not be made on the label or in the labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the definition for “low sodium.”</P>

              <P>(ii) As required in § 101.13(j)(2) for relative claims:</P>
              <P>(A) The identity of the reference food and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium differs from the reference food are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., reduced sodium eggplant parmigiana dinner “30 percent less sodium per oz (or 3 oz) than our regular eggplant parmigiana dinner”).</P>
              <P>(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium in the product per specified weight with that of the reference food that it replaces (e.g., “Sodium content has been reduced from 217 mg per 3 oz to 150 mg per 3 oz.”) is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition label, except that if the nutrition label is on the information panel, the quantitative information may be located elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section may not be made on the label or in the labeling of a food if the nutrient content of the reference food meets the definition for “low sodium.”</P>
              <P>(c) The term “salt” is not synonymous with “sodium.” Salt refers to sodium chloride. However, references to salt content such as “unsalted,” “no salt,” “no salt added” are potentially misleading.</P>
              <P>(1) The term “salt free” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods only if the food is “sodium free” as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The terms “unsalted,” “without added salt,” and “no salt added” may be used on the label or in labeling of foods only if:</P>
              <P>(i) No salt is added during processing;</P>
              <P>(ii) The food that it resembles and for which it substitutes is normally processed with salt; and</P>
              <P>(iii) If the food is not sodium free, the statement, “not a sodium free food” or “not for control of sodium in the diet” appears adjacent to the nutrition label of the food bearing the claim, or, if the nutrition label is on the information panel, it may appear elsewhere on the information panel in accordance with § 101.2.</P>
              <P>(3) Paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a food intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age is unsalted, provided such statement refers to the taste of the food and is not otherwise false and misleading.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Implied nutrient content claims and related label statements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> An implied nutrient content claim can only be made on the label and in labeling of the food if:</P>
              <P>(1) The claim uses one of the terms described in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;</P>
              <P>(2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 101.13; and</P>
              <P>(3) The food for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 101.9, § 101.10, or § 101.36, as applicable.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Label statements that are not implied claims.</E> Certain label statements about the nature of a product are not nutrient content claims unless such statements are made in a context that would make them an implied claim under § 101.13(b)(2). The following types of label statements are generally not implied nutrient content claims and, as such, are not subject to the requirements of § 101.13 and this section:</P>
              <P>(1) A claim that a specific ingredient or food component is absent from a product, provided that the purpose of such claim is to facilitate avoidance of the substances because of food allergies (see § 105.62 of this chapter), food intolerance, religious beliefs, or dietary practices such as vegetarianism or other nonnutrition related reason, e.g., “100 percent milk free;”</P>
              <P>(2) A claim about a substance that is nonnutritive or that does not have a nutritive function, e.g., “contains no preservatives,” “no artificial colors;”</P>
              <P>(3) A claim about the presence of an ingredient that is perceived to add value to the product, e.g., “made with real butter,” “made with whole fruit,” or “contains honey,” except that claims about the presence of ingredients other than vitamins or minerals or that are represented as a source of vitamins and minerals are not allowed on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals that are not in conventional food form.</P>
              <P>(4) A statement of identity for a food in which an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a food (e.g., “corn oil,” “oat bran,” “dietary supplement of vitamin C 60 mg tablet”).</P>
              <P>(5) A statement of identity that names as a characterizing ingredient, an ingredient associated with a nutrient benefit (e.g., “corn oil margarine,” “oat bran muffins,” or “whole wheat bagels”), unless such claim is made in a context in which label or labeling statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication suggest that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount; and</P>
              <P>(6) A label statement made in compliance with a specific provision of part 105 of this chapter, solely to note that a food has special dietary usefulness relative to a physical, physiological, pathological, or other condition, where the claim identifies the special diet of which the food is intended to be a part.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Particular implied nutrient content claims.</E> (1) Claims about the food or an ingredient therein that suggest that a nutrient or an ingredient is absent or <PRTPAGE P="145"/>present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”) are implied nutrient content claims and must comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The phrases “contains the same amount of [nutrient] as a [food]” and “as much [nutrient] as a [food]” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that the amount of the nutrient in the reference food is enough to qualify that food as a “good source” of that nutrient, and the labeled food, on a per serving basis, is an equivalent, good source of that nutrient (e.g., “as much fiber as an apple,” “Contains the same amount of Vitamin C as an 8 oz glass of orange juice.”).</P>
              <P>(3) Claims may be made that a food contains or is made with an ingredient that is known to contain a particular nutrient, or is prepared in a way that affects the content of a particular nutrient in the food, if the finished food is either “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient that is associated with the ingredient or type of preparation. If a more specific level is claimed (e.g., “high in ___), that level of the nutrient must be present in the food. For example, a claim that a food contains oat bran is a claim that it is a good source of dietary fiber; that a food is made only with vegetable oil is a claim that it is low in saturated fat; and that a food contains no oil is a claim that it is fat free.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">General nutritional claims.</E> (1) This paragraph covers labeling claims that are implied nutrient content claims because they:</P>
              <P>(i) Suggest that a food because of its nutrient content may help consumers maintain healthy dietary practices; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Are made in connection with an explicit or implicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams of fat”).</P>
              <P>(2) You may use the term “healthy” or related terms (e.g., “health,” “healthful,” “healthfully,” “healthfulness,” “healthier,” “healthiest,” “healthily,” and “healthiness”) as an implied nutrient content claim on the label or in labeling of a food that is useful in creating a diet that is consistent with dietary recommendations if:</P>
              <P>(i) The food meets the following conditions for fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and other nutrients:</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of nutrient content claims for butter.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Claims may be made to characterize the level of nutrients, including fat, in butter if:</P>
              <P>(1) The claim complies with the requirements of § 101.13 and with the requirements of the regulations in this subpart that define the particular nutrient content claim that is used and how it is to be presented. In determining whether a claim is appropriate, the calculation of the percent fat reduction in milkfat shall be based on the 80 percent milkfat requirement provided by the statutory standard for butter (21 U.S.C. 321a);</P>

              <P>(2) The product contains cream or milk, including milk constituents (including, but not limited to, whey, casein, modified whey, and salts of casein), or both, with or without added salt, with or without safe and suitable colorings, with or without nutrients added to comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and with or without safe and suitable bacterial cultures. The product may contain safe and suitable ingredients to improve texture, prevent syneresis, add flavor, extend shelf life, improve appearance, and add sweetness. The product may contain water to replace milkfat although the amount of water in the product shall be less than the amount of cream, milk, or milk constituents;<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) The product is not nutritionally inferior, as defined in § 101.3(e)(4), to butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a; and</P>
              <P>(4) If the product would violate 21 U.S.C. 321a but for the nutrient content claim that characterizes the level of nutrients, that claim shall be an explicit claim that is included as part of the common or usual name of the product.</P>
              <P>(b) Deviations from the ingredient provisions of 21 U.S.C. 321a must be the minimum necessary to achieve similar performance characteristics as butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a, or the food will be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(b) of the act. The performance characteristics (e.g., physical properties, organoleptic characteristics, functional properties, shelf life) of the product shall be similar to butter as produced under 21 U.S.C. 321a. If there is a significant difference in performance characteristics (that materially limits the uses of the product compared to butter,) the label shall include a statement informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., if appropriate, “not recommended for baking purposes”).

                <FP>To Whom It May Concern:</FP>
                <P>The undersigned, ____________ submits this petition under section 403(r)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to (statement of the claim and its proposed use).</P>
                <P>Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition, are the following:</P>
                <P>A. A statement identifying the descriptive term and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize with respect to the level of such nutrient. The statement should address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement should provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of foods on which the claim will be used. The statement shall specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the food must be met for the use of the term in labels or labeling to be appropriate, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.</P>
                <P>B. A detailed explanation, supported by any necessary data, of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed, and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis should specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and should include scientific data sufficient for such purpose.</P>

                <P>C. Analytical data that shows the amount of the nutrient that is the subject of the claim and that is present in the types of foods for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples using the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC International) methods where available. If no AOAC International method is available, the petitioner shall submit the <PRTPAGE P="149"/>assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data should include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.</P>
                <P>D. A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption and of any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The latter item shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the above analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.</P>
                <P>E. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.</P>

                <P>The undersigned, ______ submits this petition under section 403(r)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to (statement of the synonymous term and its proposed use in a nutrient content claim that is consistent with an existing term that has been defined under section 403(r)(2) of the act).</P>
                <P>Attached hereto and constituting a part of this petition, are the following:</P>

                <P>A. A statement identifying the synonymous descriptive term, the existing term defined by a regulation under section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act with which the synonymous term is claimed to be consistent. The statement should address why the proposed synonymous term is consistent with the term already defined by the agency, and why the use of the synonymous term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement <PRTPAGE P="150"/>should provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of foods on which the claim will be used. The statement shall specify whether any limitations not applicable to the use of the defined term are intended to apply to the use of the synonymous term.</P>
                <P>B. A detailed explanation, supported by any necessary data, of why use of the proposed term is requested, including an explanation of whether the existing defined term is inadequate for the purpose of effectively characterizing the level of a nutrient. This item shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed, and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing term defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis should specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and should include scientific data sufficient for such purpose.</P>
                <P>C. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(i) That the petition is undergoing agency review (in which case a docket number will be assigned to the petition) and the petitioner will subsequently be notified of the agency's decision to grant the petitioner permission to use the proposed term or to deny the petition; or</P>
              <P>(ii) That the petition is incomplete, e.g., it lacks any of the data required by this part, it presents such data in a manner that is not readily understood, or it has not been submitted in quadruplicate, in which case the petition will be denied, and the petitioner will be notified as to what respect the petition is incomplete.</P>
              <P>(3) Within 90 days of the date of receipt of the petition that is accepted for review (i.e., that has not been found to be incomplete and consequently denied, FDA will notify the petitioner by letter of the agency's decision to grant the petitioner permission to use the proposed term, with any conditions or limitations on such use specified, or to deny the petition, in which case the letter shall state the reasons therefor. Failure of the petition to fully address the requirements of this section shall be grounds for denial of the petition.</P>

              <P>(4) As soon as practicable following the agency's decision to either grant or deny the petition, FDA will publish a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> informing the public of his decision.

For petitions where the subject substance is a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient, the petitioner should compile a comprehensive list of the specific ingredients that will be added to the food to supply the substance in the food bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient listed, the petitioner should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of § 101.14(b)(3)(ii), e.g., that its use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction issued by the agency, and what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status.</P>
                <P>B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence.</P>
                <P>The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs.</P>
                <P>The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include answers to such questions as:</P>
                <P>1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected?</P>
                <P>2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from foods containing the substance occurs for any segment of the population?</P>
                <P>3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration?</P>
                <P>4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming the substance?</P>
                <P>In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet.</P>

                <P>If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically address <PRTPAGE P="153"/>the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly).</P>
                <P>If appropriate, the petition shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet.</P>
                <P>Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition of the term “substance” in § 101.14(a)(2).</P>
                <P>C. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative foods that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using methods from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC), where available. If no AOAC method is available, the petitioner shall submit the assay method used and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in food. The validation data should include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.</P>
                <P>D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a food label or in labeling for a food to characterize the relationship between the substance in a food to a disease or health-related condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section C of the petition. The model health claim shall include:</P>
                <P>1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and</P>
                <P>2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the health benefit that is provided.</P>
                <P>E. The petition shall include the following attachments:</P>
                <P>1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the petitioner (e.g., Medline).</P>
                <P>2. Copies of articles cited in the literature searches and other information as follows:</P>
                <P>a. All information relied upon for the support of the health claim, including copies of publications or other information cited in review articles and used to perform meta-analyses.</P>
                <P>b. All information concerning adverse consequences to any segment of the population (e.g., sensitivity to the substance).</P>
                <P>c. All information pertaining to the U.S. population.</P>
                <P>F. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under § 25.30 or § 25.32 of this chapter or an environmental assessment under § 25.40 of this chapter.</P>
                <P>Yours very truly,</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis.</E> An inadequate intake of calcium or calcium and vitamin D contributes to low peak bone mass, which has been identified as one of many risk factors in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe that it has the greatest bearing on whether a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass and susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate of bone loss after skeletal maturity. Vitamin D is required for normal absorption of calcium and to prevent the occurrence of high serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration, which stimulates mobilization of calcium from the skeleton and can lower bone mass. Calcium, along with vitamin D and several other nutrients, is required for normal bone mineralization. While vitamin D is required for optimal bone mineralization, it is more effective when calcium intake is adequate. An adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is genetically determined. The mechanism through which adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D and optimal peak bone mass reduce the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence, those with higher bone mass at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk of developing osteoporosis. <PRTPAGE P="155"/>Maintenance of adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D later in life is thought to be important in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause, but a significant protective effect is also seen among men and younger women.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of calcium or calcium and vitamin D.</E> Adequate calcium intake, or adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, which is a multifactorial bone disease. Maintenance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes throughout life is necessary to achieve optimal peak bone mass and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later life. However, vitamin D is most effective in this regard when calcium intake is adequate. Increasing intake of calcium has been shown to have beneficial effects on bone health independent of dietary vitamin D.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nature of the claim.</E> A health claim associating calcium or, when appropriate, calcium and vitamin D with a reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (d)(1) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The claim makes clear the importance of adequate calcium intake, or when appropriate, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, throughout life, in a healthful diet, are essential to reduce osteoporosis risk. The claim does not imply that adequate calcium intake, or when appropriate, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, is the only recognized risk factor for the development of osteoporosis;</P>
              <P>(B) The claim does not attribute any degree of reduction in risk of osteoporosis to maintaining an adequate dietary calcium intake, or when appropriate, an adequate dietary calcium and vitamin D intake, throughout life.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nature of the food.</E> (A) The food shall meet or exceed the requirements for a “high” level of calcium as defined in § 101.54(b);</P>
              <P>(B) The calcium content of the product shall be assimilable;</P>
              <P>(C) Dietary supplements shall meet the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for disintegration and dissolution applicable to their component calcium salts, except that dietary supplements for which no USP standards exist shall exhibit appropriate assimilability under the conditions of use stated on the product label;</P>
              <P>(D) A food or total daily recommended supplement intake shall not contain more phosphorus than calcium on a weight per weight basis.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional information.</E> (1) The claim may include the term “vitamin D” if the food meets or exceeds the requirements for a “high” level of vitamin D as defined in § 101.54(b);</P>
              <P>(2) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) The claim may make reference to physical activity.</P>
              <P>(4) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States, including the number of people in certain subpopulations in the United States, who have osteoporosis or low bone density. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or the National Osteoporosis Foundation.</P>
              <P>(5) The claim may state that the role of adequate calcium intake, or when appropriate, the role of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, throughout life is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of optimizing peak bone mass during adolescence and early adulthood. The phrase “build and maintain good bone health” may be used to convey the concept of optimizing peak bone mass. The claim may also state that adequate intake of calcium, or when appropriate, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of slowing the rate of bone loss for persons with a family history of the disease, post-menopausal women, and elderly men and women.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: dietary lipids and cancer.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between fat and cancer.</E> (1) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.</P>
              <P>(2) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established.</P>
              <P>(3) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific. Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites.</P>
              <P>(4) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy (caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FDA has concluded that evidence from both animal and human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer.</E> (1) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.</P>
              <P>(2) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and other national health professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy (calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nature of the claim.</E> A health claim associating diets low in fat with reduced risk of cancer may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The claim states that diets low in fat “may” or “might” reduce the risk of some cancers;</P>

              <P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “some types of cancer” or “some cancers”;<PRTPAGE P="157"/>
              </P>
              <P>(C) In specifying the nutrient, the claim uses the term “total fat” or “fat”;</P>
              <P>(D) The claim does not specify types of fat or fatty acid that may be related to the risk of cancer;</P>
              <P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of cancer risk reduction to diets low in fat; and</P>
              <P>(F) The claim indicates that the development of cancer depends on many factors.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nature of the food.</E> The food shall meet all of the nutrient content requirements of § 101.62 for a “low fat” food; except that fish and game meats (i.e., deer, bison, rabbit, quail, wild turkey, geese, ostrich) may meet the requirements for “extra lean” in § 101.62.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional information.</E> (1) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of cancer: Family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.</P>
              <P>(2) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section which summarize the relationship between dietary fat and cancer and the significance of the relationship.</P>
              <P>(3) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Government Printing Office.</P>
              <P>(4) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” USDA and DHHS, Government Printing Office.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Model health claims.</E> The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary fat and cancer:</P>
              <P>(1) Development of cancer depends on many factors. A diet low in total fat may reduce the risk of some cancers.</P>
              <P>(2) Eating a healthful diet low in fat may help reduce the risk of some types of cancers. Development of cancer is associated with many factors, including a family history of the disease, cigarette smoking, and what you eat.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: sodium and hypertension.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure).</E> (1) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the chemical entity or electrolyte “sodium” and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent sodium by weight.</P>
              <P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of sodium in relation to high blood pressure.</E> (1) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals. There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many <PRTPAGE P="158"/>but not all normotensive individuals as well.</P>
              <P>(2) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction, include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than others, high blood-pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure.</P>
              <P>(3) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke.</P>
              <P>(4) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 milligrams (mg) sodium per day and an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, the FDA Daily Value for sodium.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</E> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)- cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams/decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).</P>
              <P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol, and thus, with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.</E> (1) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S. population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.</P>
              <P>(2) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity (body weight 30 percent greater than ideal body weight), and lack of regular physical exercise.</P>
              <P>(3) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less per day.</P>

Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include: A family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.</P>
              <P>(2) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer.

              <P>(2) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Studies in various parts of the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers. These diets generally are low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber. Current dietary guidelines from Federal government agencies and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), and grain products (six or more servings daily).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.</E> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system.

              <P>(3) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary <PRTPAGE P="163"/>heart disease. These studies correlate diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fibers. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial, or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.</E> (1) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases.

The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet.</P>
              <P>(2) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity (body weight 30 percent greater than ideal body weight), and lack of regular physical exercise.</P>
              <P>(3) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less per day. Recommended total dietary fiber intakes are about 25 grams (g) daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber.</P>
              <P>(4) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: fruits and vegetables and cancer.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk.</E> (1) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.</P>
              <P>(2) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood, many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these nutrients. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables, including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A (as beta-carotene) and vitamin C, to displacement of fat from such diets, or to intakes of other substances in these foods which are not nutrients but may be protective against cancer risk.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and risk of cancer.</E> (1) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.</P>
              <P>(2) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables. Studies in various parts of the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers. These diets generally are low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber, vitamin A (as beta-carotene), and vitamin C. Current dietary guidelines from Federal Government agencies and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (5 or more servings daily), particularly those fruits and vegetables which contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nature of the claim.</E> A health claim associating substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables with reduced risk of cancer may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The claim states that diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables “may” or “might” reduce the risk of some cancers;</P>
              <P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “some types of cancer”, or “some cancers”;</P>
              <P>(C) The claim characterizes fruits and vegetables as foods that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber;</P>
              <P>(D) The claim characterizes the food bearing the claim as containing one or more of the following, for which the food is a good source under § 101.54: dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C;</P>
              <P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of cancer risk reduction to diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables;</P>
              <P>(F) In specifying the fat component of the labeled food, the claim uses the term “total fat” or “fat”;</P>
              <P>(G) The claim does not specify types of fats or fatty acids that may be related to risk of cancer;</P>
              <P>(H) In specifying the dietary fiber component of the labeled food, the claim uses the term “fiber”, “dietary fiber”, or “total dietary fiber”;</P>

              <P>(I) The claim does not specify types of dietary fiber that may be related to risk of cancer; and<PRTPAGE P="166"/>
              </P>
              <P>(J) The claim indicates that development of cancer depends on many factors.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nature of the food.</E> (A) The food shall be or shall contain a fruit or vegetable.</P>
              <P>(B) The food shall meet the nutrient content requirements of § 101.62 for a “low fat” food.</P>
              <P>(C) The food shall meet, without fortification, the nutrient content requirements of § 101.54 for a “good source” of at least one of the following: vitamin A, vitamin C, or dietary fiber.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional information.</E> (1) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which summarize the relationship between diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and some types of cancer and the significance of the relationship.</P>
              <P>(2) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of cancer: Family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.</P>
              <P>(3) The claim may use the word “beta-carotene” in parentheses after the term vitamin A, provided that the vitamin A in the food bearing the claim is beta-carotene.</P>
              <P>(4) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Government Printing Office.</P>
              <P>(5) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The sources of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Institutes of Health, or “Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans,” USDA and DHHS, Government Printing Office.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Model health claims.</E> The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to characterize the relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer:</P>
              <P>(1) Low fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C) may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber.</P>
              <P>(2) Development of cancer depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, foods that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, may reduce your risk of some cancers. Oranges, a food low in fat, are a good source of fiber and vitamin C.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: Folate and neural tube defects.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between folate and neural tube defects</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy, the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Relationship.</E> The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 milligrams (mg)(4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily before conception and continuing into early pregnancy had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products containing this level of folic acid are drugs). In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial that reported periconceptional use of a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of <PRTPAGE P="167"/>folic acid, and its review of the observational studies that reported periconceptional use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, the Food and Drug Administration concluded that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets, may reduce the risk of neural tube defects.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of folate</E>—(1) <E T="03">Public health concern.</E> Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., approximately 6 of 10,000 live births; about 2,500 cases among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects but not of other birth defects.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Populations at risk.</E> Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors including genetics, geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal health, including maternal age and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Those who may benefit.</E> Based on a synthesis of information from several studies, including those which used multivitamins containing folic acid at a daily dose level of ≥400 mcg (≥0.4 mg), the Public Health Service has inferred that folate alone at levels of 400 mcg (0.4 mg) per day may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The protective effect found in studies of lower dose folate measured by the reduction in neural tube defect incidence, ranges from none to substantial; a reasonable estimate of the expected reduction in the United States is 50 percent. It is expected that consumption of adequate folate will avert some, but not all, neural tube defects. The underlying causes of neural tube defects are not known. Thus, it is not known what proportion of neural tube defects will be averted by adequate folate consumption. From the available evidence, the Public Health Service estimates that there is the potential for averting 50 percent of cases that now occur (i.e., about 1,250 cases annually). However, until further research is done, no firm estimate of this proportion will be available.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The label or labeling of food may contain a folate/neural tube defect health claim provided that:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">General requirements.</E> The health claim for a food meets all of the general requirements of § 101.14 for health claims, except that a food may qualify to bear the health claim if it meets the definition of the term “good source.”</P>

Optional statements about population-based estimates of risk reduction may be made in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(F) <E T="03">Safe upper limit of daily intake.</E> Claims on foods that contain more than 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) (400 mcg) when labeled for use by adults and children 4 or more years of age, or 800 mcg when labeled for use by pregnant or lactating women) shall identify the safe upper limit of daily intake with respect to the DV. The safe upper limit of daily intake value of 1,000 mcg (1 mg) may be included in parentheses.</P>
              <P>(G) The claim shall state that folate needs to be consumed as part of a healthful diet.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nature of the food</E>—(A) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> The food shall meet or exceed the requirements for a “good source” of folate as defined in § 101.54;</P>
              <P>(B) <E T="03">Dietary supplements.</E> Dietary supplements shall meet the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for disintegration and dissolution, except that if there are no applicable USP standards, the folate in the dietary supplement shall be shown to be bioavailable under the conditions of use stated on the product label.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Limitation.</E> The claim shall not be made on foods that contain more than 100 percent of the RDI for vitamin A as retinol or preformed vitamin A or vitamin D per serving or per unit.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Nutrition labeling.</E> The nutrition label shall include information about the amount of folate in the food. This information shall be declared after the declaration for iron if only the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron are provided, or in accordance with § 101.9 (c)(8) and (c)(9) if other optional vitamins or minerals are declared.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Optional information</E>—(i) <E T="03">Risk factors.</E> The claim may specifically identify risk factors for neural tube defects. Where such information is provided, it may consist of statements from § 101.79(b)(1) or (b)(2) (e.g., Women at increased risk include those with a personal history of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy, those with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect; those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; those with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine) or from other parts of this paragraph (c)(3)(i).</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Relationship between folate and neural tube defects.</E> The claim may include statements from paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that summarize the relationship between folate and neural tube defects and the significance of the relationship except for information specifically prohibited from the claim.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Personal history of a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy.</E> The claim may state that women with a history of a neural tube defect pregnancy should consult their physicians or health care providers before becoming pregnant. If such a statement is provided, the claim shall also state that all women should consult a health care provider when planning a pregnancy.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: dietary noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between dietary carbohydrates and dental caries.</E> (1) Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a disease caused by many factors. Both environmental and genetic factors can affect the development of dental caries. Risk factors include tooth enamel crystal structure and mineral content, plaque quantity and quality, saliva quantity and quality, individual immune response, types and physical characteristics of foods consumed, eating behaviors, presence of acid producing oral bacteria, and cultural influences.</P>
              <P>(2) The relationship between consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, i.e., dietary sugars and starches, and tooth decay is well established. Sucrose, also known as sugar, is one of the most, but not the only, cariogenic sugars in the diet. Bacteria found in the mouth are able to metabolize most dietary carbohydrates, producing acid and forming dental plaque. The more frequent and longer the exposure of teeth to dietary sugars and starches, the greater the risk for tooth decay.</P>

              <P>(3) Dental caries continues to affect a large proportion of Americans. Although there has been a decline in the prevalence of dental caries among children in the United States, the disease remains widespread throughout the population, imposing a substantial burden on Americans. Recent Federal government dietary guidelines recommend that Americans choose diets that are moderate in sugars and avoid excessive <PRTPAGE P="170"/>snacking. Frequent between-meal snacks that are high in sugars and starches may be more harmful to teeth than eating such foods at meals and then brushing.</P>
              <P>(4) Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, such as sugar alcohols, can be used to replace dietary sugars, such as sucrose and corn sweeteners, in foods such as chewing gums and certain confectioneries. Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners are significantly less cariogenic than dietary sugars and other fermentable carbohydrates.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners and dental caries.</E> Noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners do not promote dental caries. The noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are slowly metabolized by bacteria to form some acid. The rate and amount of acid production is significantly less than that from sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates and does not cause the loss of important minerals from tooth enamel.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met, except that noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are exempt from § 101.14(e)(6).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nature of the claim.</E> A health claim relating noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners, compared to other carbohydrates, and the nonpromotion of dental caries may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The claim shall state that frequent between-meal consumption of foods high in sugars and starches can promote tooth decay.</P>
              <P>(B) The claim shall state that the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener present in the food “does not promote,” “may reduce the risk of,” “useful [or is useful] in not promoting,” or “expressly [or is expressly] for not promoting” dental caries.</P>
              <P>(C) In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall state “sugar alcohol,” “sugar alcohols,” or the name or names of the substances listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, e.g., “sorbitol.” D-tagatose may be identified as “tagatose.”</P>
              <P>(D) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “dental caries” or “tooth decay.”</P>
              <P>(E) The claim shall not attribute any degree of the reduction in risk of dental caries to the use of the noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing food.</P>
              <P>(F) The claim shall not imply that consuming noncariogenic carbohydrate sweetener-containing foods is the only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of dental caries.</P>
              <P>(G) Packages with less than 15 square inches of surface area available for labeling are exempt from paragraphs (A) and (C) of this section.</P>
              <P>(H) When the substance that is the subject of the claim is a noncariogenic sugar, the claim shall identify the substance as a sugar that, unlike other sugars, does not promote the development of dental caries.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Nature of the substance.</E> Eligible noncariogenic carbohydrate sweeteners are:</P>
              <P>(A) The sugar alcohols xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, lactitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, hydrogenated glucose syrups, and erythritol, or a combination of these.</P>
              <P>(B) The sugars D-tagatose and isomaltulose.</P>
              <P>(C) Sucralose.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Health claims: Soluble fiber from certain foods and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD.</E> (1) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total <PRTPAGE P="172"/>cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. High CHD rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21 (mmol/L)) or above and LDL-cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk total cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of CHD.</P>
              <P>(2) Populations with a low incidence of CHD tend to have relatively low blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. These populations also tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products, such as whole oat products.</P>
              <P>(3) Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD. Other evidence demonstrates that the addition of soluble fiber from certain foods to a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol may also help to reduce the risk of CHD.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Significance of the relationship between diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods and the risk of CHD.</E> (1) CHD is a major public health concern in the United States. It accounts for more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for CHD is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of CHD. High blood total and LDL-cholesterol are major modifiable risk factors in the development of CHD.</P>
              <P>(2) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in the diets of many people in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to CHD risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 milligrams (mg) or less per day. Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber from certain foods, when included in a low saturated fat and cholesterol diet, also helps to lower blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Requirements.</E> (1) All requirements set forth in § 101.14 shall be met. The label and labeling of foods containing psyllium husk shall be consistent with the provisions of § 101.17(f).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Specific requirements</E>—(i) <E T="03">Nature of the claim.</E> A health claim associating diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods with reduced risk of heart disease may be made on the label or labeling of a food described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) The claim states that diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain foods “may” or “might” reduce the risk of heart disease.</P>
              <P>(B) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the following terms: “heart disease” or “coronary heart disease”;</P>
              <P>(C) In specifying the substance, the claim uses the term “soluble fiber” qualified by the name of the eligible source of soluble fiber (provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)) of this section. Additionally, the claim may use the name of the food product that contains the eligible source of soluble fiber;</P>
              <P>(D) In specifying the fat component, the claim uses the terms “saturated fat” and “cholesterol”;</P>
              <P>(E) The claim does not attribute any degree of risk reduction for CHD to diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from the eligible food sources from paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; and</P>

              <P>(F) The claim does not imply that consumption of diets that are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from the eligible food sources from paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is the only recognized means of achieving a reduced risk of CHD.<PRTPAGE P="173"/>
              </P>
              <P>(G) The claim specifies the daily dietary intake of the soluble fiber source that is necessary to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and the contribution one serving of the product makes to the specified daily dietary intake level. Daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber sources listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section that have been associated with reduced risk coronary heart disease are:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) 3 g or more per day of β-glucan soluble fiber from either whole oats or barley, or a combination of whole oats and barley.</P>

              <P>(2) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in the diets of many people in the United States. One of the major public health recommendations relative to CHD risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and an average of 30 percent or less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less per day. Scientific evidence demonstrates that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with lower blood total and LDL-cholesterol levels.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common and serious forms of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood vessels. High blood total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk of developing coronary heart disease. High CHD rates occur among people with high total cholesterol levels of 240 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimole per liter (mmol/l)) or above and LDL cholesterol levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/l) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL (5.17 to 6.18 mmol/l) for total cholesterol, and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/l) of LDL cholesterol.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Certain types of statements for dietary supplements.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)(1) No later than 30 days after the first marketing of a dietary supplement that bears one of the statements listed in section 403(r)(6) or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the dietary supplement shall notify the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements (HFS-810), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, that it has included such a statement on the label or in the labeling of its product. An original and two copies of this notification shall be submitted.</P>
              <P>(2) The notification shall include the following:</P>
              <P>(i) The name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the dietary supplement that bears the statement;</P>
              <P>(ii) The text of the statement that is being made;</P>
              <P>(iii) The name of the dietary ingredient or supplement that is the subject of the statement, if not provided in the text of the statement; and</P>
              <P>(iv) The name of the dietary supplement (including brand name), if not provided in response to paragraph (a)(2)(iii) on whose label, or in whose labeling, the statement appears.</P>
              <P>(3) The notice shall be signed by a responsible individual or the person who can certify the accuracy of the information presented and contained in the notice. The individual shall certify that the information contained in the notice is complete and accurate, and that the notifying firm has substantiation that the statement is truthful and not misleading.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Disclaimer.</E> The requirements in this section apply to the label or labeling of dietary supplements where the dietary supplement bears a statement that is provided for by section 403(r)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor wishes to take advantage of the exemption to section 201(g)(1)(C) of the act that is provided by compliance with section 403(r)(6) of the act.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Text for disclaimer.</E> (1) Where there is one statement, the disclaimer shall be placed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and shall state:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.</P>
              </EXTRACT>
              
              <P>(2) Where there is more than one such statement on the label or in the labeling, each statement shall bear the disclaimer in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or a plural disclaimer may be placed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and shall state:</P>

              <P>These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to <PRTPAGE P="183"/>diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Placement.</E> The disclaimer shall be placed adjacent to the statement with no intervening material or linked to the statement with a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) at the end of each such statement that refers to the same symbol placed adjacent to the disclaimer specified in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section. On product labels and in labeling (e.g., pamphlets, catalogs), the disclaimer shall appear on each panel or page where there such is a statement. The disclaimer shall be set off in a box where it is not adjacent to the statement in question.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Typesize.</E> The disclaimer in paragraph (c) of this section shall appear in boldface type in letters of a typesize no smaller than one-sixteenth inch.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Permitted structure/function statements.</E> Dietary supplement labels or labeling may, subject to the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, bear statements that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans or that characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, provided that such statements are not disease claims under paragraph (g) of this section. If the label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement bears a disease claim as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, the product will be subject to regulation as a drug unless the claim is an authorized health claim for which the product qualifies.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Disease claims.</E> (1) For purposes of 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(6), a “disease” is damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition.</P>
              <P>(2) FDA will find that a statement about a product claims to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease (other than a classical nutrient deficiency disease) under 21 U.S.C. 343(r)(6) if it meets one or more of the criteria listed below. These criteria are not intended to classify as disease claims statements that refer to the ability of a product to maintain healthy structure or function, unless the statement implies disease prevention or treatment. In determining whether a statement is a disease claim under these criteria, FDA will consider the context in which the claim is presented. A statement claims to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product:</P>
              <P>(i) Has an effect on a specific disease or class of diseases;</P>
              <P>(ii) Has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases, using scientific or lay terminology;</P>
              <P>(iii) Has an effect on an abnormal condition associated with a natural state or process, if the abnormal condition is uncommon or can cause significant or permanent harm;</P>
              <P>(iv) Has an effect on a disease or diseases through one or more of the following factors:</P>
              <P>(A) The name of the product;</P>
              <P>(B) A statement about the formulation of the product, including a claim that the product contains an ingredient (other than an ingredient that is an article included in the definition of “dietary supplement” under 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)) that has been regulated by FDA as a drug and is well known to consumers for its use or claimed use in preventing or treating a disease;</P>
              <P>(C) Citation of a publication or reference, if the citation refers to a disease use, and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease, e.g., through placement on the immediate product label or packaging, inappropriate prominence, or lack of relationship to the product's express claims;</P>
              <P>(D) Use of the term “disease” or “diseased,” except in general statements about disease prevention that do not refer explicitly or implicitly to a specific disease or class of diseases or to a specific product or ingredient; or</P>

              <P>(E) Use of pictures, vignettes, symbols, or other means;<PRTPAGE P="184"/>
              </P>
              <P>(v) Belongs to a class of products that is intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a disease;</P>
              <P>(vi) Is a substitute for a product that is a therapy for a disease;</P>
              <P>(vii) Augments a particular therapy or drug action that is intended to diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent a disease or class of diseases;</P>
              <P>(viii) Has a role in the body's response to a disease or to a vector of disease;</P>
              <P>(ix) Treats, prevents, or mitigates adverse events associated with a therapy for a disease, if the adverse events constitute diseases; or</P>
              <P>(x) Otherwise suggests an effect on a disease or diseases.</P>

              <SUBJECT>“Fresh,” “freshly frozen,” “fresh frozen,” “frozen fresh.”</SUBJECT>
              <P>The terms defined in this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a food in conformity with the provisions of this section. The requirements of the section pertain to any use of the subject terms as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that expressly or implicitly refers to the food on labels or labeling, including use in a brand name and use as a sensory modifier. However, the use of the term “fresh” on labels or labeling is not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the term does not suggest or imply that a food is unprocessed or unpreserved. For example, the term “fresh” used to describe pasteurized whole milk is not subject to paragraph (a) of this section because the term does not imply that the food is unprocessed (consumers commonly understand that milk is nearly always pasteurized). However, the term “fresh” to describe pasta sauce that has been pasteurized or that contains pasteurized ingredients would be subject to paragraph (a) of this section because the term implies that the food is not processed or preserved. Uses of fresh not subject to this regulation will be governed by the provisions of 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</P>
              <P>(a) The term “fresh,” when used on the label or in labeling of a food in a manner that suggests or implies that the food is unprocessed, means that the food is in its raw state and has not been frozen or subjected to any form of thermal processing or any other form of preservation, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The terms “fresh frozen” and “frozen fresh,” when used on the label or in labeling of a food, mean that the food was quickly frozen while still fresh (i.e., the food had been recently harvested when frozen). Blanching of the food before freezing will not preclude use of the term “fresh frozen” to describe the food. “Quickly frozen” means frozen by a freezing system such as blast-freezing (sub-zero Fahrenheit temperature with fast moving air directed at the food) that ensures the food is frozen, even to the center of the food, quickly and that virtually no deterioration has taken place.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Provisions and restrictions.</E> (1) The following do not preclude the food from use of the term “fresh:”</P>
              <P>(i) The addition of approved waxes or coatings;</P>
              <P>(ii) The post-harvest use of approved pesticides;</P>
              <P>(iii) The application of a mild chlorine wash or mild acid wash on produce; or</P>
              <P>(iv) The treatment of raw foods with ionizing radiation not to exceed the maximum dose of 1 kiloGray in accordance with § 179.26 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A food meeting the definition in paragraph (a) of this section that is refrigerated is not precluded from use of “fresh” as provided by this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Food; exemptions from labeling.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food is fabricated from two or more ingredients).<PRTPAGE P="185"/>
              </P>
              <P>(1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the items that make up different packages packed from such assortment normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which may be present.</P>
              <P>(2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either:</P>
              <P>(i) The labeling of the bulk container plainly in view, provided ingredient information appears prominently and conspicuously in lettering of not less than one-fourth of an inch in height; or</P>
              <P>(ii) A counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously, but in no case with lettering of less than one-fourth of an inch in height, the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</P>
              <P>(3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are:</P>
              <P>(i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a functional or technical effect.</P>
              <P>(ii) Processing aids, which are as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is packaged in its finished form.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of the constitutents naturally found in the food.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.</P>
              <P>(iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.</P>

              <P>(4) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, any sulfiting agent (sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite) that has been added to any food or to any ingredient in any food and that has no technical effect in that food will be considered to be present in an insignificant amount only if no detectable amount of the agent is present in the finished food. A detectable amount of sulfiting agent is 10 parts per million or more of the sulfite in the finished food. Compliance with this paragraph will be determined using sections 20.123-20.125, “Total Sulfurous Acid,” in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 14th Ed. (1984), which is incorporated by reference and the refinements of the “Total Sulfurous Acid” procedure in the “Monier-Williams Procedure (with Modifications) for Sulfites in Foods,” which is appendix A to part 101. A copy of sections 20.123-20-125 of the Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” is available from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor).</P>
              <P>(2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the information required by these provisions.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.</P>
              <P>(c) An open container (a container of rigid or semirigid construction, which is not closed by lid, wrapper, or otherwise other than by an uncolored transparent wrapper which does not obscure the contents) of a fresh fruit or fresh vegetable, the quantity of contents of which is not more than 1 dry quart, shall be exempt from the labeling requirements of sections 403(e), (g)(2) (with respect to the name of the food specified in the definition and standard), and (i)(1) of the act; but such exemption shall be on the condition that if two or more such containers are enclosed in a crate or other shipping package, such crate or package shall bear labeling showing the number of such containers enclosed therein and the quantity of the contents of each.</P>
              <P>(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k), and (q) of the act if:</P>
              <P>(1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or</P>
              <P>(2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that such food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them.</P>

              <P>(3) The article is an egg product subject to a standard of identity promulgated in part 160 of this chapter, is to be shipped under the conditions specified in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section and for the purpose of pasteurization or other treatment as required in such standard, and each container of such egg product bears a conspicuous tag or label reading “Caution—This egg product has not been pasteurized or otherwise treated to destroy viable Salmonella microorganisms”. In addition to safe and suitable bactericidal processes designed specifically for Salmonella destruction in egg products, the term “other treatment” in the first sentence of this paragraph shall include use in acidic dressings in the processing of which the pH is not above <PRTPAGE P="187"/>4.1 and the acidity of the aqueous phase, expressed as acetic acid, is not less than 1.4 percent, subject also to the conditions that:</P>
              <P>(i) The agreement required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall also state that the operator agrees to utilize such unpasteurized egg products in the processing of acidic dressings according to the specifications for pH and acidity set forth in this paragraph, agrees not to deliver the acidic dressing to a user until at least 72 hours after such egg product is incorporated in such acidic dressing, and agrees to maintain for inspection adequate records covering such processing for 2 years after such processing.</P>
              <P>(ii) In addition to the caution statement referred to above, the container of such egg product shall also bear the statement “Unpasteurized ___ for use in acidic dressings only”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the eggs or egg product.</P>
              <P>(e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions:</P>

              <P>(2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section shall expire:</P>
              <P>(i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food constituting such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such paragraph.</P>
              <P>(f) The word “processed” as used in this paragraph shall include the holding of cheese in a suitable warehouse at a temperature of not less than 35 °F for the purpose of aging or curing to bring the cheese into compliance with requirements of an applicable definition and standard of identity. The exemptions provided for in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply to cheese which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, shipped to a warehouse for aging or curing, on condition that the cheese is identified in the manner set forth in one of the applicable following paragraphs, and in such case the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall also apply:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of varieties of cheese for which definitions and standards of identity require a period of aging whether or not they are made from pasteurized milk, each such cheese shall bear on the cheese a legible mark showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to each cheese, on its wrapper or immediate container, shall be affixed a removable tag bearing the statement “Uncured ___ cheese for completion of curing and proper labeling”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the variety of cheese. In the case of swiss cheese, the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process had been completed and at which date curing commences is the date on which the shaped curd is removed from immersion in saturated salt solution as provided in the definition and standard of identity for swiss cheese, and such cheese shall bear a removable tag reading, “To be cured and labeled as ‘swiss cheese,’ but if eyes do not form, to be labeled as ‘swiss cheese for manufacturing’ ”.</P>

              <P>(2) In the case of varieties of cheeses which when made from unpasteurized milk are required to be aged for not less than 60 days, each such cheese shall bear a legible mark on the cheese <PRTPAGE P="188"/>showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to each such cheese or its wrapper or immediate container shall be affixed a removable tag reading, “___ cheese made from unpasteurized milk.

For completion of curing and proper labeling, or for labeling as ___ cheese for manufacturing”, the blank being filled in with the applicable name of the variety of cheese.</P>
              <P>(g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following conditions are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this exemption; and</P>
              <P>(2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and that the exemption has been granted.</P>
              <P>(h) Wrapped fish fillets of nonuniform weight intended to be unpacked and marked with the correct weight at or before the point of retail sale in an establishment other than that where originally packed shall be exempt from the requirement of section 403(e)(2) of the act during introduction and movement in interstate commerce and while held for sale prior to weighing and marking:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Provided,</E> That (i) The outside container bears a label declaration of the total net weight; and</P>
              <P>(ii) The individual packages bear a conspicuous statement “To be weighed at or before time of sale” and a correct statement setting forth the weight of the wrapper;</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Provided further,</E> That it is the practice of the retail establishment to weigh and mark the individual packages with a correct net-weight statement prior to or at the point of retail sale. A statement of the weight of the wrapper shall be set forth so as to be readily read and understood, using such term as “wrapper tare—ounce”, the blank being filled in with the correct average weight of the wrapper used.</P>
              <P>(3) The act of delivering the wrapped fish fillets during the retail sale without the correct net-weight statement shall be deemed an act which results in the product's being misbranded while held for sale. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring net-weight statements for wrapped fish fillets delivered into institutional trade provided the outside container bears the required information.</P>

              <HD SOURCE="HED">Appendix A to Part 101—Monier-Williams Procedure (With Modifications) for Sulfites in Food, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration (November 1985)</HD>
              <P>The AOAC official method for sulfites (<E T="03">Official Methods of Analysis,</E> 14th Edition, 20.123-20.125, AOAC INTERNATIONAL) has been modified, in FDA laboratories, to facilitate the determination of sulfites at or near 10 ppm in food. Method instructions, including modifications, are described below.<PRTPAGE P="190"/>
              </P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Apparatus</E>—The apparatus shown diagrammatically (Figure 1) is designed to accomplish the selective transfer of sulfur dioxide from the sample in boiling aqueous hydrochloric acid to a solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide. This apparatus is easier to assemble than the official apparatus and the back pressure inside the apparatus is limited to the unavoidable pressure due to the height of the 3% H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> solution above the tip of the bubbler (F). Keeping the backpressure as low as possible reduces the likelihood that sulfur dioxide will be lost through leaks.</P>

              <P>The apparatus should be assembled as shown in Fig. 1 with a thin film of stopcock grease on the sealing surfaces of all the joints except the joint between the separatory funnel and the flask. Each joint should be clamped together to ensure a complete seal throughout the analysis. The separatory funnel, B, should have a capacity of 100 ml or greater. An inlet adapter, A, with a hose connector (Kontes K-183000 or equivalent) is required to provide a means of applying a head of pressure above the solution. (A pressure equalizing dropping funnel is not recommended because condensate, perhaps with sulfur dioxide, is deposited in the funnel and the side arm.) The round bottom flask, C, is a 1000 ml flask with three 24/40 tapered joints. The gas inlet tube, D, (Kontes K-179000 or equivalent) should be of sufficient length to permit introduction of the nitrogen within 2.5 cm of the bottom of the flask. The Allihn condenser, E, (Kontes K-431000-2430 or equivalent) has a jacket length of 300 mm. The bubbler, F, was fabricated from glass according to the dimensions given in Fig. 2. The 3% hydrogen peroxide solution can be contained in a vessel, G, with an i.d. of <E T="03">ca.</E> 2.5 cm and a depth of 18 cm.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Buret</E>—A 10 ml buret (Fisher Cat. No. 03-848-2A or equivalent) with overflow tube and hose connections for an Ascarite tube or equivalent air scrubbing apparatus. This will permit the maintenance of a carbon dioxide-free atmosphere over the standardized 0.01<E T="03">N</E> sodium hydroxide.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Chilled Water Circulator</E>—The condensor must be chilled with a coolant, such as 20% methanol-water, maintained at 5 °C. A circulating pump equivalent to the Neslab Coolflow 33 is suitable.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Reagents</HD>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Aqueous hydrochloric acid, 4N.</E>—For each analysis prepare 90 ml of hydrochloric acid by adding 30 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (12N) to 60 ml of distilled water.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Methyl red indicator</E>—Dissolve 250 mg of methyl red in 100 ml ethanol.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Hydrogen peroxide solution, 3%</E>—Dilute ACS reagent grade 30% hydrogen peroxide to 3% with distilled water. Just prior to use, add three drops of methyl red indicator and titrate to a yellow end-point using 0.01<E T="03">N</E> sodium hydroxide. If the end-point is exceeded discard the solution and prepare another 3% H<E T="52">2</E>O<E T="52">2</E> solution.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Standardized titrant, 0.01N NaOH</E>—Certified reagent may be used (Fisher SO-5-284). It should be standardized with reference standard potassium hydrogen phthalate.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Nitrogen</E>—A source of high purity nitrogen is required with a flow regulator that will maintain a flow of 200 cc per minute. To guard against the presence of oxygen in the nitrogen, an oxygen scrubbing solution such as an alkaline pyrogallol trap may be used. Prepare pyrogallol trap as follows:</P>
              <P>1. Add 4.5 g pyrogallol to the trap.</P>
              <P>2. Purge trap with nitrogen for 2 to 3 minutes.</P>
              <P>3. Prepare a KOH solution prepared by adding 65g KOH to 85 ml distilled water (caution: heat).</P>
              <P>4. Add the KOH solution to the trap while maintaining an atmosphere of nitrogen in the trap.</P>
              <HD SOURCE="HD2">Determination</HD>

              <P>Assemble the apparatus as shown in Fig. 1. The flask C must be positioned in a heating mantle that is controlled by a power regulating device such as Variac or equivalent. Add 400 ml of distilled water to flask C. Close the stopcock of separatory funnel, B, and add 90 ml of 4<E T="03">N</E> hydrochloric acid to the separatory funnel. Begin the flow of nitrogen at a rate of 200±10 cc/min. The condenser coolant flow must be initiated at this time. Add 30 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide, which has been titrated to a yellow end-point with 0.01<E T="03">N</E> NaOH, to container G. After fifteen minutes the apparatus and the distilled water will be thoroughly de-oxygenated and the apparatus is ready for sample introduction.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sample preparation (solids)</E>—Transfer 50 g of food, or a quantity of food with a convenient quantity of SO<E T="52">2</E> (500 to 1500 mcg SO<E T="52">2</E>), to a food processor or blender. Add 100 ml of 5% ethanol in water and briefly grind the mixture. Grinding or blending should be continued only until the food is chopped into pieces small enough to pass through the 24/40 point of flask C.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sample preparation (liquids)</E>—Mix 50 g of the sample, or a quantity with a convenient quantity of SO<E T="52">2</E> (500 to 1500 mcg SO<E T="52">2</E>), with 100 ml of 5% ethanol in water.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Sample introduction and distillation</E>—Remove the separatory funnel B, and quantitatively transfer the food sample in aqueous ethanol to flask C. Wipe the tapered joint clean with a laboratory tissue, apply stopcock grease to the outer joint of the separatory funnel, and return the separatory funnel, B, to tapered joint flask C. The nitrogen flow through the 3% hydrogen peroxide solution should resume as soon as the funnel, B, is re-inserted into the appropriate joint in flask C. Examine each joint to ensure that it is sealed.<PRTPAGE P="191"/>
              </P>
              <P>Apply a head pressure above the hydrochloric acid solution in B with a rubber bulb equipped with a valve. Open the stopcock in B and permit the hydrochloric acid solution to flow into flask C. Continue to maintain sufficient pressure above the acid solution to force the solution into the flask C. The stopcock may be closed, if necessary, to pump up the pressure above the acid and then opened again. Close the stopcock before the last few milliliters drain out of the separatory funnel, B, to guard against the escape of sulfur dioxide into the separatory funnel.</P>
              <P>Apply the power to the heating mantle. Use a power setting which will cause 80 to 90 drops per minute of condensate to return to the flask from condenser, E. After 1.75 hours of boiling the contents of the 1000 ml flask and remove trap G.</P>
              <P>
                <E T="03">Titration.</E>—Titrate the contents with 0.01<E T="03">N</E> sodium hydroxide. Titrate with 0.01<E T="03">N</E> NaOH to a yellow end-point that persists for at least twenty seconds. Compute the sulfite content, expressed as micrograms sulfur dioxide per gram of food (ppm) as follows:
              </P>
              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">ppm = (32.03 × V<E T="52">B</E> × N × 1000) ÷ Wt</FP>
              

              <FP SOURCE="FP-2">where 32.03 = milliequivalent weight of sulfur dioxide; V<E T="52">B</E> = volume of sodium hydroxide titrant of normality, N, required to reach endpoint; the factor, 1000, converts milliequivalents to microequivalents and Wt = weight (g) of food sample introduced into the 1000 ml flask.</FP>

              <P>(2) Include the amount of the named juice, declared in a 5- percent range (e.g., Raspcranberry; raspberry and cranberry juice beverage, 10- to 15-percent cranberry juice and 3- to 8-percent raspberry juice). The 5-percent range, when used, shall be declared in the manner set forth in § 102.5(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(e) The common or usual name of a juice that has been modified shall include a description of the exact nature of the modification (e.g., “acid-reduced cranberry juice,” “deflavored, de­colored grape juice”).</P>
              <P>(f) If the product is a beverage that contains a juice whose color, taste, or other organoleptic properties have been modified to the extent that the original juice is no longer recognizable at the time processing is complete, or if its nutrient profile has been diminished to a level below the normal nutrient range for the juice, then the source fruits or vegetables from which the modified juice was derived may not be depicted on the label by vignette or other pictorial representation.</P>
              <P>(g)(1) If one or more juices in a juice beverage is made from concentrate, the name of the juice must include a term indicating that fact, such as “from concentrate,” or “reconstituted.” Such terms must be included in the name of each individual juice or it may be stated once adjacent to the product name so that it applies to all the juices, (e.g., “cherry juice (from concentrate) in a blend of two other juices” or “cherry juice in a blend of 2 other juices (from concentrate)”). The term shall be in a type size no less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the juice.</P>
              <P>(2) If the juice is 100 percent single species juice consisting of juice directly expressed from a fruit or vegetable whose Brix level has been raised by the addition of juice concentrate from the same fruit or vegetable, the name of the juice need not include a statement that the juice is from concentrate. However, if water is added to this 100 percent juice mixture to adjust the Brix level, the product shall be labeled with the term “from concentrate” or “reconstituted.”</P>

              <SUBJECT>Statement of purpose.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) The fundamental objective of this subpart is to establish a uniform set of principles that will serve as a model for the rational addition of nutrients to foods. The achievement and maintenance of a desirable level of nutritional quality in the nation's food supply is an important public health objective. The addition of nutrients to specific foods can be an effective way of maintaining and improving the overall nutritional quality of the food supply. However, random fortification of foods could result in over- or underfortification in consumer diets and create nutrient imbalances in the food supply. It could also result in deceptive or misleading claims for certain foods. The Food and Drug Administration does not encourage indiscriminate addition of nutrients to foods, nor does it consider it appropriate to fortify fresh produce; meat, poultry, or fish products; sugars; or snack foods such as candies and carbonated beverages. To preserve a balance of nutrients in the diet, manufacturers who elect to fortify foods are urged to utilize these principles when adding nutrients to food. It is reasonable to anticipate that the Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's) as delineated in § 101.9 of this chapter and <PRTPAGE P="208"/>in paragraph (d) of this section will be amended from time to time to list additional nutrients and/or to change the levels of specific RDI's as improved knowledge about human nutrient requirements and allowances develops. The policy set forth in this section is based on U.S. dietary practices and nutritional needs and may not be applicable in other countries.</P>
              <P>(b) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may appropriately be added to a food to correct a dietary insufficiency recognized by the scientific community to exist and known to result in nutritional deficiency disease if:</P>
              <P>(1) Sufficient information is available to identify the nutritional problem and the affected population groups, and the food is suitable to act as a vehicle for the added nutrients. Manufacturers contemplating using this principle are urged to contact the Food and Drug Administration before implementing a fortification plan based on this principle.</P>
              <P>(2) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation for a food or class of food that requires, permits, or prohibits nutrient additions. (Other Federal regulations include, but are not limited to, standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, nutritional quality guidelines established in subpart C of this part, and common or usual name regulations established in part 102 of this chapter.)</P>
              <P>(c) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may appropriately be added to a food to restore such nutrient(s) to a level(s) representative of the food prior to storage, handling, and processing, when:</P>
              <P>(1) The nutrient is shown by adequate scientific documentation to have been lost in storage, handling, or processing in a measurable amount equal to at least 2 percent of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) of protein and of potassium and 2 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) in a normal serving of the food.</P>
              <P>(2) Good manufacturing practices and normal storage and handling procedures cannot prevent the loss of such nutrient(s),</P>
              <P>(3) All nutrients, including protein, iodine and vitamin D, that are lost in a measurable amount are restored and all ingredients of the food product that contribute nutrients are considered in determining restoration levels; and</P>
              <P>(4) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation that requires or prohibits nutrient addition(s), or the food has not been fortified in accordance with any other Federal regulation that permits voluntary nutrient additions.</P>
              <P>(d) A nutrient(s) listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section may be added to a food in proportion to the total caloric content of the food, to balance the vitamin, mineral, and protein content if:</P>
              <P>(1) A normal serving of the food contains at least 40 kilocalories (that is, 2 percent of a daily intake of 2,000 kilocalories);</P>
              <P>(2) The food is not the subject of any other Federal regulation for a food or class of food that requires, permits, or prohibits nutrient additions; and</P>
              <P>(3) The food contains all of the following nutrients per 100 calories based on 2,000 calorie total intake as a daily standard:</P>

              <P>(e) A nutrient(s) may appropriately be added to a food that replaces traditional food in the diet to avoid nutritional inferiority in accordance with § 101.3(e)(2) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(f) Nutrient(s) may be added to foods as permitted or required by applicable <PRTPAGE P="209"/>regulations established elsewhere in this chapter.</P>
              <P>(g) A nutrient added to a food is appropriate only when the nutrient:</P>
              <P>(1) Is stable in the food under customary conditions of storage, distribution, and use;</P>
              <P>(2) Is physiologically available from the food;</P>
              <P>(3) Is present at a level at which there is a reasonable assurance that consumption of the food containing the added nutrient will not result in an excessive intake of the nutrient, considering cumulative amounts from other sources in the diet; and</P>
              <P>(4) Is suitable for its intended purpose and is in compliance with applicable provisions of the act and regulations governing the safety of substances in food.</P>
              <P>(h) Any claims or statements in the labeling of food about the addition of a vitamin, mineral, or protein to a food shall be made only if the claim or statement is not false or misleading and otherwise complies with the act and any applicable regulations. The following label claims are acceptable:</P>
              <P>(1) The labeling claim “fully restored with vitamins and minerals” or “fully restored with vitamins and minerals to the level of unprocessed ___” (the blank to be filled in with the common or usual name of the food) may be used to describe foods fortified in accordance with the principles established in paragraph (c) of the section.</P>
              <P>(2) The labeling claim, “vitamins and minerals (and “protein” when appropriate) added are in proportion to caloric content” may be used to describe food fortified in accordance with the principles established in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) When labeling claims are permitted, the term “enriched,” “fortified,” “added,” or similar terms may be used interchangeably to indicate the addition of one or more vitamins or minerals or protein to a food, unless an applicable Federal regulation requires the use of specific words or statements.</P>
              <P>(i) It is inappropriate to make any claim or statement on a label or in labeling, other than in a listing of the nutrient ingredients as part of the ingredient statement, that any vitamin, mineral, or protein has been added to a food to which nutrients have been added pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</P>

              <P>(1) A frozen “heat and serve” dinner prepared from conventional food ingredients listed in paragraph (a) of this section will also contain folic acid, magnesium, iodine, calcium, and zinc. Minimum levels for these nutrients cannot be established at the present time but may be specified as additional data are obtained.</P>
              <P>(2) The minimum levels for pantothenic acid, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 are tentative. Final levels will be established when sufficient data are available. Until final levels are established, a product containing less than the tentative levels will not be deemed to be misbranded when labeled in accordance with § 104.5(b).</P>
              <P>(3) When technologically practicable, iodized salt shall be used or iodine shall be present at a level equivalent to that which would be present if iodized salt were used in the manufacture of the product.</P>
              <P>(4) When technologically practicable, product components and ingredients shall be selected to obtain the desirable calcium to phosphorous ratio of 1:1. Technological addition of phosphates shall be minimized and shall not exceed the amount necessary for the intended effect.</P>
              <P>(e) If the product includes servings of food which are not prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section (e.g., soup, bread or rolls, beverage, or dessert), their contribution shall not be considered in determining compliance with the nutrient levels established in paragraph (d) of this section but shall be included in any nutrition labeling.</P>
              <P>(f) For the purposes of labeling, an “average serving” shall be one entire frozen “heat and serve” dinner.</P>

              <P>The definitions and interpretations of terms contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (hereafter “the act”) shall be applicable with the following additions:</P>
              <P>(a)(1) The term <E T="03">special dietary uses,</E> as applied to food for man, means particular (as distinguished from general) uses of food, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Uses for supplying particular dietary needs which exist by reason of a physical, physiological, pathological or other condition, including but not limited to the conditions of diseases, convalescence, pregnancy, lactation, allergic hypersensitivity to food, underweight, and overweight;</P>
              <P>(ii) Uses for supplying particular dietary needs which exist by reason of age, including but not limited to the ages of infancy and childhood;</P>

              <P>(iii) Uses for supplementing or fortifying the ordinary or usual diet with any vitamin, mineral, or other dietary property. Any such particular use of a food is a special dietary use, regardless <PRTPAGE P="211"/>of whether such food also purports to be or is represented for general use.</P>
              <P>(2) The use of an artificial sweetener in a food, except when specifically and solely used for achieving a physical characteristic in the food which cannot be achieved with sugar or other nutritive sweetener, shall be considered a use for regulation of the intake of calories and available carbohydrate, or for use in the diets of diabetics and is therefore a special dietary use.</P>

              <P>(2) A special dietary food may contain a nonnutritive sweetener or other ingredient only if the ingredient is safe for use in the food under the applicable law and regulations of this chapter. Any food that achieves its special dietary usefulness in reducing or maintaining body weight through the use of a nonnutritive sweetener shall bear on its label the statement required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but need not state the percentage by weight of the nonnutritive sweetener. If a nutritive sweetener(s) as well as <PRTPAGE P="212"/>nonnutritive sweetener(s) is added, the statement shall indicate the presence of both types of sweetener, e.g., “Sweetened with nutritive sweetener(s) and nonnutritive sweetener(s).”</P>

              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label terms suggesting usefulness as low calorie or reduced calorie foods.</E> (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section, and in § 101.13(q)(2) of this chapter for soft drinks, a food may be labeled with terms such as “diet,” “dietetic,” “artificially sweetened,” or “sweetened with nonnutritive sweetener” only if the claim is not false and misleading, and the food is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears another comparative calorie claim in compliance with part 101 of this chapter and this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms that is specifically authorized by regulation governing a particular food, or, unless otherwise restricted by regulation, to any use of the term “diet” that clearly shows that the food is offered solely for a dietary use other than regulating body weight, e.g., “for low-sodium diets.”</P>
              <P>(3) Paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not apply to any use of such terms on a formulated meal replacement or other food that is represented to be of special dietary use as a whole meal, pending the issuance of a regulation governing the use of such terms on foods.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">“Sugar free,” and “no added sugar.”</E> Criteria for the use of the terms “sugar free” and “no added sugar” are provided for in § 101.60(c) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) The criteria set forth in subparts B, C, and D of this part prescribe the steps that manufacturers shall take under section 412(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350a(b)(2) and (b)(3)) in processing infant formula. If the processing of the formula does not comply with any regulation in subparts B, C, or D of this part, the formula will be deemed to be adulterated under section 412(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(b) The criteria set forth in subpart E of this part prescribe the requirements for quality factors that infant formula shall meet under section 412(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If the formula fails to comply with any regulation in subpart E of this part, it will be deemed to be adulterated under section 412(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(c) The criteria set forth in subpart F of this part prescribe records requirements for quality factors under section 412(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and for good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures, including distribution and audit records, under section 412(b)(2). If an infant formula manufacturer fails to comply with the quality factor record requirements in subpart F of this part with respect to an infant formula, the formula will be deemed to be adulterated under section 412(a)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If an infant formula manufacturer fails to comply with the good manufacturing practices or quality control procedures record requirements in subpart F of this part with respect to an infant formula, the infant formula will be deemed to be adulterated under section 412(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The criteria set forth in subpart F of this part also implement record retention requirements under section 412(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Failure to comply with any regulation in subpart F of this part is a violation of section 301(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331(e)).</P>
              <P>(d) The criteria set forth in subpart G of this part describe, in part, certain good manufacturing practices, quality control procedures, and quality factor records requirements under section 412(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If an infant formula manufacturer fails to comply with such records requirements with respect to an infant formula, the infant formula will be deemed to be adulterated under section 412(a)(2) or (a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as applicable. The criteria set forth in subpart G of this part also describe the circumstances in which an infant formula manufacturer is required to register with, submit to, or notify the Food and Drug Administration, and the content of a registration, submission, or notification, under section 412(c), (d), and (e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Failure to comply with any regulation in subpart G of this part is a violation of section 301(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

This checking shall ensure that the correct ingredient is added during the manufacturing process, that the ingredient has been released for use in infant formula, and that the correct weight or measure of the ingredient is added to the production unit.</P>
              <P>(c) A manufacturer shall establish a system of identification for the contents of all compounding and storage containers, processing lines, and major equipment used during the manufacture of a production aggregate of an infant formula. The system shall permit the identification of the processing stage and the unique identification number for the particular production unit or production aggregate of infant formula.</P>
              <P>(d) A manufacturer shall establish controls to ensure that the nutrient levels required by § 107.100 of this chapter are maintained in the formula, and that the formula is not contaminated with microorganisms or other contaminants. Such controls shall include:</P>
              <P>(1) The mixing time; the speed, temperature, and flow rate of product; and other critical parameters necessary to ensure the addition of required ingredients to, and the homogeneity of, the formula;</P>
              <P>(2) The spray-drying process for powdered infant formula, including the filtering of the intake air before heating, to prevent microbial and other contamination;</P>
              <P>(3) The removal of air from the finished product to ensure that nutrient deterioration does not occur;</P>
              <P>(4) Ensuring that each container of finished product is properly sealed. Such controls shall involve use of established procedures, specifications, and intervals of examination that are designed by qualified individuals and are sufficient to:</P>
              <P>(i) Detect visible closure or seal defects, and</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine closure strength through destructive testing. A manufacturer of a liquid infant formula that is a thermally processed low-acid food packaged in a hermetically sealed container shall perform such closure integrity testing in accordance with § 113.60(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) A manufacturer shall establish controls that ensure that the equipment used at points where control is deemed necessary to prevent adulteration is monitored, so that personnel will be alerted to malfunctions.</P>
              <P>(f) A manufacturer shall establish controls for in-process material as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) For any specification established in accordance with § 106.6(c)(1) that a manufacturer fails to meet for in-process material, an individual qualified by education, training, or experience shall conduct a documented review and shall make a material disposition decision to reject the affected in-process material, to reprocess or otherwise recondition the affected in-process material, or to approve and release the affected in-process material for use or distribution;</P>

              <P>(2) Pending a documented review and material disposition decision, any in-process material that fails to meet any <PRTPAGE P="223"/>specification established in accordance with § 106.6(c)(1) shall be clearly identified as such and shall be controlled under a quarantine system designed to prevent its use in manufacturing or processing operations until completion of the documented review and material disposition decision;</P>
              <P>(3) Any in-process material that has been reprocessed or otherwise reconditioned shall be the subject of a documented review and material disposition decision by an individual qualified by education, training, or experience to determine whether it may be released for use; and</P>
              <P>(4) Any rejected in-process material shall be clearly identified as having been rejected for use in infant formula and shall be controlled under a quarantine system designed to prevent its use in infant formula manufacturing or processing operations.</P>

              <P>(a) During manufacture, a manufacturer shall test each production aggregate for nutrients as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) Each nutrient premix used in the manufacture of an infant formula shall be tested for each nutrient (required under § 107.100 of this chapter or otherwise added by the manufacturer) that the manufacturer is relying on the premix to provide, to ensure that the premix is in compliance with the manufacturer's specifications;</P>
              <P>(2) During the manufacturing process, after the addition of the premix, or at the final product stage but before distribution, each production aggregate of infant formula shall be tested for at least one indicator nutrient for each of the nutrient premixes used in the infant formula to confirm that the nutrients supplied by each of the premixes are present, in the proper concentration, in the production aggregate of infant formula.</P>
              <P>(3) At the final product stage, before distribution of an infant formula, each production aggregate shall be tested for vitamins A, C, E, and thiamin.</P>
              <P>(4) During the manufacturing process or at the final product stage, before distribution, each production aggregate shall be tested for all nutrients required to be included in such formula under § 107.100 of this chapter for which testing is not conducted for compliance with paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section and for any nutrient added by the manufacturer for which testing is not conducted for compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A manufacturer shall test each production aggregate of finished product for nutrients as follows:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) For an infant formula that is a new infant formula the manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and at the final product stage, a representative sample of the first production aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form (powder, ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all nutrients required under § 107.100 of this chapter and all other nutrients added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such testing every 4 months thereafter throughout the shelf life of the product.</P>
              <P>(ii) The Food and Drug Administration will exempt the manufacturer from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if the manufacturer of a new infant formula requests an exemption and provides analytical data, as required under § 106.120(b)(7), that demonstrates that the stability of the new infant formula will likely not differ from the stability of formulas with similar composition, processing, and packaging for which there are extensive stability data. A manufacturer exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section would be required to test the first production aggregate according to the requirements of § 106.91(b)(2).</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer shall collect, from each manufacturing site and at the final product stage, a representative sample of each subsequent production aggregate of packaged, finished formula in each physical form (powder, ready-to-feed, or concentrate) and evaluate the levels of all nutrients required under § 107.100 of this chapter and all other nutrients added by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall repeat such testing at the end of the shelf life of the product.</P>

              <P>(3) If the results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not substantiate the shelf life of the infant formula, the manufacturer shall address, as appropriate, all production aggregates of formula released and pending release for distribution that are implicated by the testing results, such as by conducting the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section on a subsequently produced production aggregate to substantiate the shelf life of the infant formula or <PRTPAGE P="226"/>revising the use by date for such product so that such date is substantiated by the stability testing results.</P>
              <P>(4) If results of the testing required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section show that any required nutrient is not present in the production aggregate of infant formula at the level required by § 107.100 of this chapter or that any nutrient added by the manufacturer is not present at the level declared on the label of the production aggregate of infant formula, the manufacturer shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Investigate the cause of such variance in the level of any required or added nutrient;</P>
              <P>(ii) Evaluate the significance, if any, of the results for other production aggregates of the same formula that have been released for distribution;</P>
              <P>(iii) Address, as appropriate, all production aggregates of formula released and pending release for distribution that are implicated by the testing results; and</P>
              <P>(iv) Determine whether it is necessary to conduct the testing required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) The testing required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is not required to evaluate the level of minerals present in the infant formula.</P>
              <P>(c) All quality control testing shall be conducted using appropriate, scientifically valid test methods.</P>

              <P>(vii) All findings and evaluations of the complaint.</P>
              <P>(6) The manufacturer should maintain the files regarding infant formula complaints at the establishment where the infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed. When the manufacturer wishes to maintain all consumer complaints for the entire firm at one location other than at the facility where an infant formula was manufactured, processed, or packed, the manufacturer may do so as long as all records required by this section are available within 24 hours of request for inspection at that facility. However, all records of consumer complaints, including summaries, any reports, and any files, maintained at the manufacturing facility or at any other facility shall be made available to investigators for review and copying upon request.</P>
              <P>(l) The manufacturer shall make readily available for authorized inspection all records required under this part or copies of such records. Records shall be available at any reasonable time at the establishment where the activities described in such records occurred. (Infant formula complaint files may be maintained at one facility, as provided in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, if all required records are readily available at that facility.) These records or copies thereof shall be subject to photocopying or other means of reproduction as part of such inspection. Records that can be immediately retrieved from another location by electronic means shall be considered as meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(m) A manufacturer shall maintain all records required under this part in a manner that ensures that both the manufacturer and the Food and Drug Administration can be provided with access to such records within 24 hours. The manufacturer may maintain the records required under this part as original records, as true copies such as photocopies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the original records, or as electronic records. Where reduction techniques, such as microfilming, are used, suitable reader and photocopying equipment shall be readily available. All electronic records maintained under this part shall comply with part 11 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(n) Production control, product testing, testing results, complaints, and distribution records necessary to verify compliance with parts 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, and 117 of this chapter, or with other appropriate regulations, shall be retained for 1 year after the expiration of the shelf life of the infant formula or 3 years from the date of manufacture, whichever is greater.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Status and applicability of the regulations in part 107.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The criteria in subpart B of this part describe the labeling requirements applicable to infant formula under section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C 343). Failure to comply with any regulation in subpart B of this part will render an infant formula misbranded under section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>

              <P>(b) The criteria in subpart C of this part describe the terms and conditions for the exemption of an infant formula from the requirements of section 412(a), (b), and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, <PRTPAGE P="240"/>and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350a(a), (b), and (c)). Failure to comply with any regulations in subpart C of this part will result in withdrawal of the exemption given under section 412(h)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(c) Subpart D of this part contains the nutrient requirements for infant formula under section 412(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Failure to comply with any regulation in subpart D of this part will render an infant formula adulterated under section 412(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</P>
              <P>(d) An exempt infant formula is subject to the provisions of § 107.50 and other applicable Food and Drug Administration food regulations.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Terms and conditions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Terms and conditions.</E> Section 412(f)(1) of the act exempts from the requirements of section 412(a), (b), and (c)(1)(A) of the act infant formulas that are represented and labeled for use by an infant who has an inborn error of metabolism or low brith weight or who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem, if such formulas comply with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The regulations in this subpart establish the terms and conditions that a manufacturer must meet with respect to such infant formulas.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Infant formulas generally available at the retail level.</E> (1) These exempt infant formulas can generally be purchased from retail store shelves that are readily available to the public. Such formulas are also typically represented and labeled for use to provide dietary management for diseases or conditions that are not clinically serious or life-threatening, even though such formulas may also be represented and labeled for use in clinically serious or life-threatening disorders.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, an infant formula manufacturer shall, with respect to each formula covered by this paragraph, comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, the quality control procedure requirements of part 106, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, the manufacturer shall submit to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, on or before May 21, 1986, or on or before the 90th day before the first processing of the infant formula for commercial or charitable distribution, whichever occurs later, the label and other labeling of the infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for the infant formula, and a detailed description of the medical conditions for which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review the information under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, when any change in ingredients or processes that may result in an adverse impact on levels of nutrients or availability of nutrients is instituted, the manufacturer shall submit to FDA at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, before the first processing of the infant formula, the label and other labeling of the infant formula, a complete quantitative formulation for the infant formula, a detailed description of the reformulation and the rationale for the reformulation, a complete description of the change in processing, and a detailed description of the medical conditions for which the infant formula is represented. FDA will review that information under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Infant formulas not generally available at the retail level.</E> (1) These exempt infant formulas are not generally found on retail shelves for general consumer purchase. Such formulas typically are prescribed by a physician, and must be requested from a pharmacist or are distributed directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and State or Federal agencies. Such formulas are also generally represented and labeled solely to provide dietary management for specific diseases or conditions that are clinically serious or life-threatening <PRTPAGE P="244"/>and generally are required for prolonged periods of time. Exempt infant formulas distributed directly to institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and State or Federal agencies that are of the same formulation as those generally available at the retail level are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section rather than to the requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, an infant formula manufacturer shall, with respect to each formula covered by this paragraph, comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</P>
              <P>(3) Each manufacturer of an infant formula covered by this paragraph shall establish quality control procedures designed to ensure that the infant formula meets applicable nutrient requirements of this section, including any special nutritional characteristics for the specific disorders or conditions for which the formula is represented for use. Each manufacturer shall maintain records of such quality control procedures sufficient to permit a public health evaluation of each manufactured batch of infant formula and shall permit any authorized FDA employee at all reasonable times to have access to and to copy and verify the records referred to in this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(4) To retain the exempt status of an infant formula covered by this paragraph, the manufacturer shall submit the information required by paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) A manufacturer may deviate from the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section only with respect to those specific requirements for which it submits to FDA, at the address specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the medical, nutritional, scientific, or technological rationale (including any appropriate animal or human clinical studies). FDA will review that information under paragaraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(6) The requirements of this section do not apply to an infant formula specially and individually prepared for one or more specific infants on a physician's request.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">FDA review of exempt status.</E> (1) FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition will review information submitted by infant formula manufacturers under paragraph (b) (3), (b) (4), or (c)(4) of this section. On the basis of such review and other information available to the agency, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition may impose additional conditions on, or modify requirements for, the quality control procedures, nutrient specifications, or labeling of an infant formula, or withdraw a product's exempt status. Such determinations will be made by the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) If after completing its review of all information submitted, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition concludes that additional or modified quality control, nutrient, or labeling requirements are needed, or that a product's exempt status is withdrawn, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition will so notify the manufacturer and this notification will specify the reasons therefor. Upon receipt of this notification, the manufacturer has 10 working days to have the decision reviewed under § 10.75 by the office of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. A determination by the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition that is not appealed becomes a final agency decision.</P>
              <P>(ii) After a final decision by the Director or by the office of the Commissioner that a product's exempt status is withdrawn, the manufacturer shall comply with the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act, the quality control requirements of part 106, and the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part.</P>

              <P>(iii) The compliance date for the withdrawal of a product's exempt status or the imposition of additional or modified quality control, nutrient, or labeling requirements is 60 calendar days after issuance of the final decision except as otherwise provided for reasons stated in the decision. If the agency determines that a health hazard <PRTPAGE P="245"/>may exist and so notifies the manufacturer, withdrawal of a product's exempt status shall be effective on the date of receipt of notification from the Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Additional or modified requirements, or the withdrawal of an exemption, apply only to those formulas that are manufactured after the compliance date. A postponement of the compliance date may be granted for good cause.</P>
              <P>(3) FDA may decide that withdrawal of an exemption is necessary when, on the basis of its review under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it concludes that quality control procedures are not adequate to ensure that the formula contains all required nutrients, that deviations in nutrient levels are not supported by generally accepted scientific, nutritional, or medical rationale, or that deviations from subpart B of this part are not necessary to provide appropriate directions for preparation and use of the infant formula, or that additional labeling information is necessary.</P>
              <P>(4) FDA will use the following criteria in determining whether deviations from the requirements of this subpart are necessary and will adequately protect the public health:</P>
              <P>(i) A deviation from the nutrient requirements of section 412(g) of the act or of regulations promulgated under section 412(a)(2) of the act is necessary to provide an infant formula that is appropriate for the dietary management of a specific disease, disorder, or medical condition;</P>
              <P>(ii) For exempt infant formulas subject to paragraph (b) of this section, a deviation from the quality control procedures requirements of part 106 is necessary because of unusal or difficult technological problems in manufacturing the infant formula; and</P>
              <P>(iii) A deviation from the labeling requirements of subpart B of this part is necessary because label information, including pictograms and symbols required by those regulations, could lead to inappropriate use of the product.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Notification requirements.</E> (1) Information required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Office of Nutrition, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, Infant Formula and Medical Foods Staff (HFS-850), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.</P>
              <P>(2) The manufacturer shall promptly notify the Food and Drug Administration when the manufacturer has knowledge (as defined in section 412(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) that reasonably supports the conclusion that an exempt infant formula that has been processed by the manufacturer and that has left an establishment subject to the control of the manufacturer may not provide the nutrients required by paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, or when there is an exempt infant formula that may be otherwise adulterated or misbranded and if so adulterated or misbranded presents a risk of human health. This notification shall be made, by telephone, to the Director of the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter. After normal business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.), contact the Food and Drug Administration Emergency Call Center at 866-300-4374. The manufacturer shall send a followup written confirmation to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-605), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, and to the appropriate FDA district office specified in part 5, subpart M of this chapter.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Elements of an infant formula recall.</SUBJECT>
              <P>A recalling firm shall conduct an infant formula recall with the following elements:</P>
              <P>(a) The recalling firm shall evaluate in writing the hazard to human health associated with the use of the infant formula. This health hazard evaluation shall include consideration of any disease, injury, or other adverse physiological effect that has been or that could be caused by the infant formula and of the seriousness, likelihood, and consequences of the diseases, injury, or other adverse physiological effect. The Food and Drug Administration will conduct its own health hazard evaluation and promptly notify the recalling firm of the results of that evaluation if the criteria for recall under § 107.200 have been met.</P>
              <P>(b) The recalling firm shall devise a written recall strategy suited to the individual circumstances of the particular recall. The recall strategy shall take into account the health hazard evaluation and specify the following: The extent of the recall; if necessary, the public warning to be given about any hazard presented by the infant formula; the disposition of the recalled infant formula; and the effectiveness checks that will be made to determine that the recall is carried out.</P>

              <P>(c) The recalling firm shall promptly notify each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format of a recall communication shall be distinctive, and the content and extent of a recall communication shall be commensurate with the hazard of the infant formula being recalled and the strategy developed for the recall. The <PRTPAGE P="248"/>recall communication shall instruct consignees to report back quickly to the recalling firm about whether they are in possession of the recalled infant formula and shall include a means of doing so. The recalled communication shall also advise consignees how to return the recall infant formula to the manufacturer or otherwise dispose of it. The recalling firm shall send a followup recall communication to any consignee that does not respond to the initial recall communication.</P>
              <P>(d) If the infant formula presents a risk to human health, the recalling firm shall request that each establishment, at which such infant formula is sold or available for sale, post at the point of purchase of such formula a notice of such recall at such establishment. The notice shall be provided by the recalling firm after approval of the notice by the Food and Drug Administration. The recalling firm shall also request that each retail establishment maintain such notice on display until such time as the Food and Drug Administration notifies the recalling firm that the agency considers the recall completed.</P>
              <P>(e) The recalling firm shall furnish promptly to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office listed in part 5, subpart M of this chapter, as they are available, copies of the health hazard evaluation, the recall strategy, and all recall communications (including, for a recall under § 107.200, the notice to be displayed at retail establishments) directed to consignees, distributors, retailers, and members of the public.</P>

The order shall specify the mandatory conditions and requirements with which there is a lack of compliance.</P>
              <P>(1) The manufacturer, processor, or packer shall have 3 working days after receipt of such order within which to file objections. Such objections may be filed by telegram, telex, or any other mode of written communication addressed to the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration (HFS-605), 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740. If such objections are filed, the determination is stayed pending a hearing to be held within 5 working days after the filing of objections on the issues involved unless the Commissioner determines that the objections raise no genuine and substantial issue of fact to justify a hearing.</P>

              <P>(c) Within 5 working days after the hearing, and based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the Commissioner shall determine whether a permit is required and shall so inform the manufacturer, processor, or packer in writing, with the reasons for his decision.</P>
              <P>(d) The Commissioner's determination of the need for a permit constitutes final agency action from which appeal lies to the courts. The Commissioner will not stay a determination of the need for a permit pending court appeal except in unusual circumstances, but will participate in expediting any such appeal.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Acidified foods.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Inadequate or improper manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to health. The harmful nature of such foods cannot be adequately determined after these foods have entered into interstate commerce. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs therefore finds that, to protect the public health, it may be necessary to require any commericial processor, in any establishment engaged in the manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods, to obtain and hold a temporary emergency permit provided for under section 404 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Such a permit may be required whenever the Commissioner finds, after investigation, that the commercial processor has failed to fulfill all the requirements of this section, including registration and filing of process information, and the mandatory portions of §§ 114.10, 114.80(a) (1) and (2), and (b), 114.83, 114.89, and 114.100 (b), (c), and (d) <PRTPAGE P="253"/>of this chapter as they relate to acidified foods. These requirements are intended to ensure safe manufacturing, processing, and packing processes and to permit the Food and Drug Administration to verify that these processes are being followed. Failure to meet these requirements shall constitute a prima facie basis for the immediate application of the emergency permit control provisions of section 404 of the act to that establishment, under the procedures established in subpart A of this part.</P>
              <P>(b) The definitions in § 114.3 of this chapter are applicable when those terms are used in this section.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) <E T="03">Registration.</E> A commercial processor, when first engaging in the manufacture, processing, or packing of acidified foods in any State, as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the act, shall, not later than 10 days after first so engaging, register and file with the Food and Drug Administration on Form FDA 2541 (food canning establishment registration) information including, but not limited to, the name of the establishment, principal place of business, the location of each establishment in which that processing is carried on, the processing method in terms of acidity and pH control, and a list of foods so processed in each establishment. These forms are available from the LACF Registration Coordinator (HFS-303), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or at any Food and Drug Administration district office.

If during the first year of the three-year record retention period the processing plant is closed for a prolonged period between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some other reasonably accessible location at the end of the seasonal pack. Upon written demand during the course of a factory inspection pursuant to section 704 of the act by a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration, a commercial processor shall permit the inspection and copying by such employee of these records to verify the adequacy of processing, the integrity of container closures, and the coding of the products.</P>

              <P>(i) This section shall not apply to the commercial processing of any food processed under the continuous inspection of the meat and poultry inspection program of the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (34 Stat. 1256, as amended by 81 Stat. 584 (21 U.S.C. 601 <E T="03">et seq.</E>)) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (71 Stat. 441, as amended by 82 Stat. 791 (21 U.S.C. 451 <E T="03">et seq.</E>)).</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Compliance with State regulations.</E> (1) Wherever the Commissioner finds that any State regulates the commercial thermal processing of low-acid foods in accordance with effective regulations specifying at least the requirements of part 113 of this chapter, he shall issue a notice stating that compliance with such State regulations shall constitute compliance with part 113 of this chapter. However, the provisions of this section shall remain applicable to the commercial processing of low-acid foods in any such State, except that, either the State through its regulatory agency or each processor of low-acid foods in such State shall file with the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition the registration information and the processing information prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>

              <P>(2) The Commissioner finds that the regulations adopted by the State of California under the laws relating to cannery inspections governing thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers satisfy the requirements of part 113 of this chapter.
              </P>
              <FP>Accordingly, processors, who under the laws relating to cannery inspections are licensed by the State of California and who comply with such state regulations, shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of part 113 of this chapter.</FP>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Imports.</E> (1) This section shall apply to any foreign commercial processor engaged in the thermal processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers and offering such foods for import into the United States except that, in lieu of providing for the issuance of an emergency permit under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner will request the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse admission into the United States, pursuant to section 801 of the act, of any such low-acid foods which the Commissioner determines, after investigation, may result in the distribution in interstate commerce of processed foods that may be injurious to <PRTPAGE P="259"/>health as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Any such food refused admission shall not be admitted until such time as the Commissioner may determine that the commercial processor offering the food for import is in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this section and that such food is not injurious to health. For the purpose of making such determination, the Commissioner reserves the right for a duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration to inspect the commercial processor's manufacturing, processing, and packing facilities.</P>

              <P>(b) When appropriate under the criteria of § 109.6, and under section 402(a)(1) of the act, a regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a food additive, may be established by regulation in subpart C of this part under the provisions of sections 402(a)(1) and 701(a) of the act. A regulatory limit may prohibit any detectable amount of the substance in food. The regulatory limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) When appropriate under the criteria of § 109.6, an action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a food additive, may be established to define a level of contamination at which a food may be regarded as adulterated.</P>

              <P>(2) Whenever an action level is established or changed, a notice shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as soon as practicable thereafter.

              <SUBJECT>Added poisonous or deleterious substances.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a pesticide chemical, that is also a food additive, will be controlled by a regulation issued under section 409 of the act when possible. When such a use cannot be approved under the criteria of section 409 of the act, or when the added poisonous or deleterious substance is not a food additive, a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level may be established pursuant to the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Residues resulting from the use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical will ordinarily be controlled by a tolerance established in a regulation issued under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When such a regulation has not been issued, an action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical may be established by the Food and Drug Administration. The Food and Drug Administration will request EPA to recommend such an action level pursuant to the criteria established in paragraph (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) A tolerance for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the following criteria are met:</P>
              <P>(1) The substance cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.</P>
              <P>(2) The tolerance established is sufficient for the protection of the public health, taking into account the extent to which the presence of the substance cannot be avoided and the other ways in which the consumer may be affected by the same or related poisonous or deleterious substances.</P>
              <P>(3) No technological or other changes are foreseeable in the near future that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance established. Examples of changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance include anticipated improvements in good manufacturing practice that would change the extent to which use of the substance is unavoidable and anticipated studies expected to provide significant new toxicological or use data.</P>
              <P>(c) A regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when each of the following criteria is met:</P>

              <P>(1) The substance cannot be avoided by current good manufacturing practices.<PRTPAGE P="261"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) There is no tolerance established for the substance in the particular food under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act.</P>
              <P>(3) There is insufficient information by which a tolerance may be established for the substance under section 406 of the act or technological changes appear reasonably possible that may affect the appropriateness of a tolerance. The regulatory limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.</P>
              <P>(d) An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established when the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are met, except that technological or other changes that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance are foreseeable in the near future. An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in any food may be established at a level at which the Food and Drug Administration may regard the food as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, without regard to the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section or in section 406 of the act. An action level will be withdrawn when a tolerance or regulatory limit for the same substance and use has been established.</P>
              <P>(e) Tolerances will be established under authority appropriate for action levels (sections 306, 402(a), and 701(a) of the act, together with section 408 or 409 of the act, if appropriate) as well as under authority appropriate for tolerances (sections 406 and 701 of the act). In the event the effectiveness of a tolerance is stayed pursuant to section 701(e)(2) of the act by the filing of an objection, the order establishing the tolerance shall be deemed to be an order establishing an action level until final action is taken upon such objection.</P>

              <P>(a) Tolerances and action levels in this part are established at levels based on the unavoidability of the poisonous or deleterious substance concerned and do not establish a permissible level of contamination where it is avoidable.</P>
              <P>(b) Compliance with tolerances, regulatory limits, and action levels does not excuse failure to observe either the requirement in section 402(a)(4) of the act that food may not be prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions or the other requirements in this chapter that food manufacturers must observe current good manufacturing practices. Evidence obtained through factory inspection or otherwise indicating such a violation renders the food unlawful, even though the amounts of poisonous or deleterious substances are lower than the currently established tolerances, regulatory limits, or action levels. The manufacturer of food must at all times utilize quality control procedures which will reduce contamination to the lowest level currently feasible.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, and plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn caused the contamination of food products intended for human consumption (meat, milk and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration <PRTPAGE P="262"/>have revealed that a significant percentage of paper food-packaging material contains PCB's which can migrate to the packaged food. The origin of PCB's in such material is not fully understood. Reclaimed fibers containing carbonless copy paper (contains 3 to 5 percent PCB's) have been identified as a primary source of PCB's in paper products. Some virgin paper products have also been found to contain PCB's, the source of which is generally attributed to direct contamination from industrial accidents from the use of PCB-containing equipment and machinery in food packaging manufacturing establishments. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food-packaging materials as a result of industrial accidents, which can cause the PCB contamination of food, represents a hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.</P>
              <P>(b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude the accidental PCB contamination of food-packaging materials:</P>
              <P>(1) New equipment or machinery for manufacturing food-packaging materials shall not contain or use PCB's.</P>
              <P>(2) On or before September 4, 1973, the management of establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials shall:</P>
              <P>(i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment for manufacturing food-packaging materials sampled and tested to determine whether it contains PCB's or verify the absence of PCB's in such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices be replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.</P>
              <P>(ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices from the establishment any other PCB-containing equipment, machinery and materials wherever there is a reasonable expectation that such articles could cause food-packaging materials to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.</P>

              <P>(iii) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least potentially hazardous replacement is used. In making this determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (<E T="03">a</E>) its toxicity; (<E T="03">b</E>) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its color and odor; (<E T="03">c</E>) possible signaling devices in the equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; and (<E T="03">d</E>) its environmental stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.</P>
              <P>(c) The provisions of this section do not apply to electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Tolerances for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are toxic, industrial chemicals. Because of their widespread, uncontrolled industrial applications, PCB's have become a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment. As a result, certain foods and animal feeds, principally those of animal and marine origin, contain PCB's as unavoidable, environmental contaminants. PCB's are transmitted to the food portion (meat, milk, and eggs) of food-producing animals ingesting PCB-contaminated animal feed. In addition, a significant percentage of paper food-packaging materials contain PCB's which may migrate to the packaged food. The source of PCB's in paper food-packaging materials is primarily of certain types of carbonless copy paper (containing 3 to 5 percent PCB's) in waste paper stocks used for manufacturing recycled paper. Therefore, temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's as unavoidable environmental or industrial contaminants are established for a sufficient period of time following the effective date of this paragraph to permit the elimination of such contaminants at the earliest practicable time. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's)” is applicable to mixtures of chlorinated biphenyl compounds, irrespective of which mixture of PCB's is present as the residue. The temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's are as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) 1.5 parts per million in milk (fat basis).</P>
              <P>(2) 1.5 parts per million in manufactured dairy products (fat basis).</P>
              <P>(3) 3 parts per million in poultry (fat basis).</P>
              <P>(4) 0.3 parts per million in eggs.</P>
              <P>(5) 0.2 parts per million in finished animal feed for food-producing animals (except the following finished animal feeds: feed concentrates, feed supplements, and feed premixes).</P>

              <P>(6) 2 parts per million in animal feed components of animal origin, including <PRTPAGE P="264"/>fishmeal and other by-products of marine origin and in finished animal feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes intended for food producing animals.</P>

              <P>(c) A barrier is functional for purposes of paragraph (a)(9) of this section if the barrier limits migration of PCB's from the packaging material to food to a level not exceeding the migration which occurs under the same test conditions from packaging material containing 10 parts per million PCB without the use of a barrier. A class of barrier material is functional for purposes of paragraph (a)(9) of this section if a representative barrier of the class limits migration of PCB's from the packaging material to food to a level not exceeding the migration which occurs under the same test conditions from packaging material containing 10 parts per million PCB without the use of a barrier. Migration levels shall be determined for purpose of this paragraph solely by use of testing conditions described in “Test Procedures for Determination of PCB Permeability of Food Packaging, Inner-Wraps, September 1976, revised May 1983”, which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_ regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> A class of barrier material shall be deemed functional only if the definition of the class and the designation of one or more representative barriers has been approved by the Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration. In the event that the Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, does not approve a proposal made to the Center regarding the definition of a class of barrier material or the designation of representative barriers, the Director shall advise the person making the proposal of the reasons for the Center's disapproval within 90 days of receipt of the proposal. All proposals for definition of classes and determinations of the Food and Drug Administration regarding such proposals shall be on file with the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.</P>

              <P>(d) Any person who asserts that a barrier or class of barriers is functional shall submit the results of tests conducted to determine the functionality of the barrier or class of barriers to Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-308), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740. All barriers or classes of barriers shall be tested with the four solid food receptors specified in “Test Procedures for Determination of PCB Permeability of Food Packaging, Inner-Wraps, September 1976, revised May 1983”, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this reference is given in paragraph (c) of this section.

              <SUBJECT>Definitions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The definitions and interpretations of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) are applicable to such terms when used in this part. The following definitions shall also apply:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Acid foods or acidified foods</E> means foods that have an equilibrium pH of 4.6 or below.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Adequate</E> means that which is needed to accomplish the intended purpose in keeping with good public health practice.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Batter</E> means a semifluid substance, usually composed of flour and other ingredients, into which principal components of food are dipped or with which they are coated, or which may be used directly to form bakery foods.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Blanching,</E> except for tree nuts and peanuts, means a prepackaging <PRTPAGE P="266"/>heat treatment of foodstuffs for a sufficient time and at a sufficient temperature to partially or completely inactivate the naturally occurring enzymes and to effect other physical or biochemical changes in the food.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Critical control point</E> means a point in a food process where there is a high probability that improper control may cause, allow, or contribute to a hazard or to filth in the final food or decomposition of the final food.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Food</E> means food as defined in section 201(f) of the act and includes raw materials and ingredients.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Food-contact surfaces</E> are those surfaces that contact human food and those surfaces from which drainage onto the food or onto surfaces that contact the food ordinarily occurs during the normal course of operations. “Food-contact surfaces” includes utensils and food-contact surfaces of equipment.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Lot</E> means the food produced during a period of time indicated by a specific code.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Microorganisms</E> means yeasts, molds, bacteria, and viruses and includes, but is not limited to, species having public health significance. The term “undesirable microorganisms” includes those microorganisms that are of public health significance, that subject food to decomposition, that indicate that food is contaminated with filth, or that otherwise may cause food to be adulterated within the meaning of the act. Occasionally in these regulations, FDA used the adjective “microbial” instead of using an adjectival phrase containing the word microorganism.</P>
              <P>(j) <E T="03">Pest</E> refers to any objectionable animals or insects including, but not limited to, birds, rodents, flies, and larvae.</P>
              <P>(k) <E T="03">Plant</E> means the building or facility or parts thereof, used for or in connection with the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding of human food.</P>
              <P>(l) <E T="03">Quality control operation</E> means a planned and systematic procedure for taking all actions necessary to prevent food from being adulterated within the meaning of the act.</P>
              <P>(m) <E T="03">Rework</E> means clean, unadulterated food that has been removed from processing for reasons other than insanitary conditions or that has been successfully reconditioned by reprocessing and that is suitable for use as food.</P>
              <P>(n) <E T="03">Safe-moisture level</E> is a level of moisture low enough to prevent the growth of undesirable microorganisms in the finished product under the intended conditions of manufacturing, storage, and distribution. The maximum safe moisture level for a food is based on its water activity (a<E T="52">w</E>). An a<E T="52">w</E> will be considered safe for a food if adequate data are available that demonstrate that the food at or below the given a<E T="52">w</E> will not support the growth of undesirable microorganisms.</P>
              <P>(o) <E T="03">Sanitize</E> means to adequately treat food-contact surfaces by a process that is effective in destroying vegetative cells of microorganisms of public health significance, and in substantially reducing numbers of other undesirable microorganisms, but without adversely affecting the product or its safety for the consumer.</P>
              <P>(p) <E T="03">Shall</E> is used to state mandatory requirements.</P>
              <P>(q) <E T="03">Should</E> is used to state recommended or advisory procedures or identify recommended equipment.</P>
              <P>(r) <E T="03">Water activity</E> (a<E T="52">w</E>) is a measure of the free moisture in a food and is the quotient of the water vapor pressure of the substance divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Natural or unavoidable defects in food for human use that present no health hazard.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Some foods, even when produced under current good manufacturing practice, contain natural or unavoidable defects that at low levels are not hazardous to health. The Food and Drug Administration establishes maximum levels for these defects in foods produced under current good manufacturing practice and uses these levels in deciding whether to recommend regulatory action.<PRTPAGE P="275"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) Defect action levels are established for foods whenever it is necessary and feasible to do so. These levels are subject to change upon the development of new technology or the availability of new information.</P>
              <P>(c) Compliance with defect action levels does not excuse violation of the requirement in section 402(a)(4) of the act that food not be prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions or the requirements in this part that food manufacturers, distributors, and holders shall observe current good manufacturing practice. Evidence indicating that such a violation exists causes the food to be adulterated within the meaning of the act, even though the amounts of natural or unavoidable defects are lower than the currently established defect action levels. The manufacturer, distributor, and holder of food shall at all times utilize quality control operations that reduce natural or unavoidable defects to the lowest level currently feasible.</P>
              <P>(d) The mixing of a food containing defects above the current defect action level with another lot of food is not permitted and renders the final food adulterated within the meaning of the act, regardless of the defect level of the final food.</P>
              <P>(e) A compilation of the current defect action levels for natural or unavoidable defects in food for human use that present no health hazard may be obtained upon request from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-565), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740.</P>

              <SUBJECT>What must you do to determine whether specifications are met?</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Before you use a component, you must:</P>
              <P>(1)(i) Conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, unless you petition the agency under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and the agency exempts you from such testing;</P>

              <P>(ii) You may submit a petition, under 21 CFR 10.30, to request an exemption from the testing requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. The petition must set forth the scientific rationale, and must be accompanied by the supporting data and information, for proposed alternative testing that will demonstrate that there is no material diminution of assurance, compared to the assurance provided by 100 percent identity testing, of the identity of <PRTPAGE P="288"/>the dietary ingredient before use when the dietary ingredient is obtained from one or more suppliers identified in the petition. If FDA grants the petition, you must conduct the tests and examinations for the dietary ingredient, otherwise required under § 111.75(a)(1)(i), under the terms specified by FDA when the petition is granted; and</P>
              <P>(2) Confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with § 111.70(b) are met. To do so, you must either:</P>
              <P>(i) Conduct appropriate tests or examinations; or</P>
              <P>(ii) Rely on a certificate of analysis from the supplier of the component that you receive, provided that:</P>
              <P>(A) You first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier's certificate of analysis through confirmation of the results of the supplier's tests or examinations;</P>
              <P>(B) The certificate of analysis includes a description of the test or examination method(s) used, limits of the test or examinations, and actual results of the tests or examinations;</P>
              <P>(C) You maintain documentation of how you qualified the supplier;</P>
              <P>(D) You periodically re-confirm the supplier's certificate of analysis; and</P>
              <P>(E) Your quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and re-qualification) of any supplier.</P>
              <P>(b) You must monitor the in-process points, steps, or stages where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the finished batch of dietary supplement to:</P>
              <P>(1) Determine whether the in-process specifications are met; and</P>
              <P>(2) Detect any deviation or unanticipated occurrence that may result in a failure to meet specifications.</P>
              <P>(c) For a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), you must verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement. To do so:</P>
              <P>(1) You must select one or more established specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and the limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the dietary supplement that, if tested or examined on the finished batches of the dietary supplement, would verify that the production and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that meets all product specifications (or only those product specifications not otherwise exempted from this provision by quality control personnel under paragraph (d) of this section);</P>
              <P>(2) You must conduct appropriate tests or examinations to determine compliance with the specifications selected in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;</P>
              <P>(3) You must provide adequate documentation of your basis for determining that compliance with the specification(s) selected under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, through the use of appropriate tests or examinations conducted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will ensure that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets all product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, and the limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to the adulteration of, the dietary supplement; and</P>
              <P>(4) Your quality control personnel must review and approve the documentation that you provide under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(d)(1) You may exempt one or more product specifications from verification requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if you determine and document that the specifications you select under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for determination of compliance with specifications are not able to verify that the production and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that meets the exempted product specification and there is no scientifically valid method for testing or examining such exempted product specification at the finished batch stage. In such a case, you must <PRTPAGE P="289"/>document why, for example, any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, and any other information, will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch; and</P>
              <P>(2) Your quality control personnel must review and approve the documentation that you provide under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(e) Before you package or label a product that you receive for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement (and for distribution rather than for return to the supplier), you must visually examine the product and have documentation to determine whether the specifications that you established under § 111.70 (f) are met.</P>
              <P>(f)(1) Before you use packaging, you must, at a minimum, conduct a visual identification of the containers and closures and review the supplier's invoice, guarantee, or certification to determine whether the packaging specifications are met; and</P>
              <P>(2) Before you use labels, you must, at a minimum, conduct a visual examination of the label and review the supplier's invoice, guarantee, or certification to determine whether label specifications are met.</P>
              <P>(g) You must, at a minimum, conduct a visual examination of the packaging and labeling of the finished packaged and labeled dietary supplements to determine whether you used the specified packaging and applied the specified label.</P>
              <P>(h)(1) You must ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods.</P>
              <P>(2) The tests and examinations that you use must include at least one of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Gross organoleptic analysis;</P>
              <P>(ii) Macroscopic analysis;</P>
              <P>(iii) Microscopic analysis;</P>
              <P>(iv) Chemical analysis; or</P>
              <P>(v) Other scientifically valid methods.</P>
              <P>(i) You must establish corrective action plans for use when an established specification is not met.</P>

              <P>(A) For an untreated surface water source, a minimum number of five samples per year (or an alternative testing frequency that you establish and use, in accordance with § 112.49).</P>
              <P>(B) For an untreated ground water source, a minimum of one sample per year.</P>

              <P>(ii) The samples of agricultural water must be representative of your use of the water and must be collected as <PRTPAGE P="321"/>close in time as practicable to, but prior to, harvest.</P>
              <P>(iii) To update the microbial water quality profile, you must calculate revised GM and STV values using your current annual survey data, combined with your most recent initial or annual survey data from within the previous 4 years, to make up a rolling data set of:</P>
              <P>(A) At least 20 samples for untreated surface water sources; and</P>
              <P>(B) At least 4 samples for untreated ground water sources.</P>
              <P>(iv) You must modify your water use, as appropriate, based on the revised GM and STV values in your updated microbial water quality profile in accordance with § 112.45(b).</P>
              <P>(3) If you have determined or have reason to believe that your microbial water quality profile no longer represents the quality of your water (for example, if there are significant changes in adjacent land use that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the quality of your water source), you must develop a new microbial water quality profile reflective of the time period at which you believe your microbial water quality profile changed.</P>
              <P>(i) To develop a new microbial water quality profile, you must calculate new GM and STV values using your current annual survey data (if taken after the time of the change), combined with new data, to make up a data set of:</P>
              <P>(A) At least 20 samples for untreated surface water sources; and</P>
              <P>(B) At least 4 samples for untreated ground water sources.</P>
              <P>(ii) You must modify your water use based on the new GM and STV values in your new microbial water quality profile in accordance with § 112.45(b).</P>
              <P>(c) If you use untreated ground water for the purposes that are subject to the requirements of § 112.44(a), you must initially test the microbial quality of each source of the untreated ground water at least four times during the growing season or over a period of 1 year, using a minimum total of four samples collected to be representative of the intended use(s). Based on these results, you must determine whether the water can be used for that purpose, in accordance with § 112.45(a). If your four initial sample results meet the microbial quality criteria of § 112.44(a), you may test once annually thereafter, using a minimum of one sample collected to be representative of the intended use(s). You must resume testing at least four times per growing season or year if any annual test fails to meet the microbial quality criteria in § 112.44(a).</P>

              <SUBJECT>What requirements are applicable to an informal hearing?</SUBJECT>
              <P>If the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the farm requests an informal hearing, and FDA grants the request:</P>

              <P>(a) The hearing will be held within 15 calendar days after the date the appeal is filed or, if applicable, within a timeframe agreed upon in writing by the <PRTPAGE P="341"/>owner, operator, or agent in charge of the farm and FDA.</P>
              <P>(b) The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under this subpart be completed within 1 calendar day, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) The order withdrawing an exemption under § 112.5, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of the opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for a hearing under this subpart must be addressed to the FDA Division Director (or, in the case of a foreign farm, the Director of the Office of Compliance in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition) as provided in the order withdrawing an exemption.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 112.209, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees who preside at hearings under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer must prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. The presiding officer must include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and must include a proposed decision, with a statement of reasons. The hearing participant may review and comment on the presiding officer's report within 2 calendar days of issuance of the report. The presiding officer will then issue the final decision.</P>
              <P>(5) Section 16.80(a)(4) of this chapter does not apply to a regulatory hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer's report of the hearing and any comments on the report by the hearing participant under § 112.208(c)(4) are part of the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(6) No party shall have the right, under § 16.119 of this chapter to petition the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for reconsideration or a stay of the presiding officer's final decision.</P>
              <P>(7) If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of an order withdrawing an exemption, the hearing must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under a regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that § 16.95(b) does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the administrative record of the hearing specified in §§ 16.80(a)(1), (2), (3), and (5) of this chapter and 112.208(c)(5) constitutes the exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision. For purposes of judicial review under § 10.45 of this chapter, the record of the administrative proceeding consists of the record of the hearing and the presiding officer's final decision.</P>

Vents shall be controlled by gate, plug cock, or other adequate type valves which shall be fully open to permit rapid discharge of air from the retort during the venting period. Vents shall not be connected directly to a closed drain system. If the overflow is used as a vent, there shall be an atmospheric break in the line before it connects to a closed drain. The vent shall be located in that portion of the retort opposite the steam inlet; for example, steam inlet in bottom portion and vent in top portion. Where a retort manifold connects several vent pipes from a single still retort, it shall be controlled by a gate, plug cock, or other adequate type of valve. The retort manifold shall be of a size that the cross-sectional area of the pipe is larger than the total cross-sectional area of all connecting vents. The discharge shall not be directly connected to a closed drain without an atmospheric break in the line.

Both the time at which the reel stopped and the time the retort was used for a still retort process, if so used, shall be indicated on the temperature-recording device record and entered on the other production records required in this chapter. If the alternative procedure of emptying the retort is followed, the subsequent handling methods used for the containers in the retort at the time of the temperature drop shall be entered on the production records. If the temperature drop was less than 10 °F (5 °C), a scheduled authorized emergency still process approved by a qualified person(s) having expert knowledge of thermal processing requirements may be used before restarting the retort reel. Alternatively, container entry to the retort shall be stopped and an authorized emergency agitating process may be used before container entry to the retort is restarted. When emergency procedures are used, no containers may enter the retort and the process and procedures used shall be noted on the production records.</P>

              <P>(a) Before using raw materials and ingredients susceptible to microbiological contamination, the processor shall ensure that those materials and ingredients are suitable for use in processing low-acid food. Compliance with this requirement may be accomplished by receiving the raw materials and ingredients under a supplier's <PRTPAGE P="373"/>guarantee that they are suitable for use, by examining them for their microbiological condition, or by other acceptable means.</P>
              <P>(b) Blanching by heat, when required in the preparation of food for canning, should be effected by heating the food to the required temperature, holding it at this temperature for the required time, and then either rapidly cooling the food or passing it to subsequent processing without delay. Thermophilic growth and contamination in blanchers should be minimized by the use of adequate operating temperatures and by cleaning. If the blanched food product is washed before filling, potable water should be used.</P>
              <P>(c) The filling of containers, either mechanically or by hand, shall be controlled so as to ensure that the filling requirements specified in the scheduled process are met.</P>
              <P>(d) The exhausting of containers for the removal of air shall be controlled so as to meet the conditions for which the process was designed. Compliance with the requirement may be accomplished by heat exhausting, mechanical exhausting, hot brining, or steam injection.</P>
              <P>(e) When the maintenance of pH (above 4.6) of a normally low-acid food is a basis for a scheduled process, there shall be careful supervision to ensure that the equilibrium pH of the finished product meets that of the scheduled process. The methodology described in § 114.90 of this chapter should be used.</P>

              <P>(f) When the scheduled process sets forth critical factors to prevent the growth of microorganisms not destroyed by the thermal process, the factors shall be carefully controlled to ensure that the limits established in the scheduled process are not exceeded. When normally low-acid foods require sufficient solute to permit safe processing at low temperatures, such as in boiling water, there shall be careful supervision to ensure that the equilibrium water activity (a<E T="52">w</E>) of the finished product meets that of the scheduled process. The scheduled thermal processes for foods having an a<E T="52">w</E> greater than 0.85 and less than the a<E T="52">w</E> that would allow the growth of spores of microorganisms of public health significance shall be sufficient to render the food free of microorganisms capable of reproducing in the food under normal nonrefrigerated conditions of storage and distribution.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Establishing scheduled processes.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Scheduled processes for low-acid foods shall be established by qualified persons having expert knowledge of thermal processing requirements for low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers and having adequate facilities for making such determinations. The type, range, and combination of variations encountered in commercial production shall be adequately provided for in establishing the scheduled process. Variations include those that occur due to seasonal or growing fluctuations, variety differences, supplier processes, reprocessing, and mixing a batch of processed product with the same unprocessed product before it is processed. Critical factors, e.g., minimum headspace, consistency, maximum fill-in or drained weight, a<E T="52">w</E>, <E T="03">etc.,</E> that may affect the scheduled process, shall be specified in the scheduled process. Acceptable scientific methods of establishing heat sterilization processes shall include, when necessary, but shall not be limited to, the use of microbial thermal death time data, process calculations based on product heat penetration data, and inoculated packs. Calculation shall be performed according to procedures recognized by competent processing authorities. If incubation tests are necessary for process confirmation, they shall include containers from test trials and from actual commercial production runs during the period of instituting the process. The incubation tests for confirmation of the scheduled processes should include the containers from the test trials and a number of containers from each of four or more actual commercial production runs. The number of containers from actual commercial production runs should be determined on the basis of recognized scientific methods to be of a size sufficient to ensure the adequacy of the process. Complete records covering all aspects of the establishment of the process and associated incubation tests shall be <PRTPAGE P="374"/>prepared and shall be permanently retained by the person or organization making the determination.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Operations in the thermal processing room.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Operating processes and retort venting procedures to be used for each product and container size being packed shall either be posted in a conspicuous place near the processing equipment or be made readily available to the retort or processing system operator and any duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration. Scheduled processes must be made readily available to the supervisor and any duly authorized employee of the Food and Drug Administration.</P>
              <P>(b) A system for product traffic control in the retort room shall be established to prevent unretorted product from bypassing the retort process. Each retort basket, truck, car, or crate used to hold containers in a retort, or one or more containers therein, shall, if it contains any retorted food product, be plainly and conspicuously marked with a heat-sensitive indicator, or by other effective means that will indicate visually, to thermal processing personnel, those units that have been retorted. A visual check shall be performed to determine whether or not the appropriate change has occurred in the heat-sensitive indicator as a result of retorting for all retort baskets, trucks, cars, or crates, to ensure that each unit of product has been retorted. A record of these checks should be made.</P>
              <P>(c) The initial temperature of the contents of the containers to be processed shall be accurately determined and recorded with sufficient frequency to ensure that the temperature of the product is no lower than the minimum initial temperature specified in the scheduled process. For those operations that use water during the filling of the retort or during processing, provision shall be made to ensure that the water will not, before the start of each thermal process, lower the initial temperature of the product below that specified in the scheduled process. The temperature-indicating device used to determine the initial temperature shall be tested for accuracy against a reference device for which the accuracy is traceable to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or other national metrology institute, standard reference device, by appropriate standard procedures, with sufficient frequency to ensure that initial temperature measurements are accurate. Records of the accuracy of the temperature-indicating device and of a reference device that is maintained by the processor shall be established and maintained in accordance with § 113.100(c) and (d).</P>
              <P>(d) Timing devices used in recording thermal process time information shall be accurate to the extent needed to ensure that the processing time and venting time specified in the scheduled process are achieved. Pocket or wrist watches are not considered satisfactory for timing purposes. Digital clocks may be used if the operating process and the venting schedule have a 1-minute or greater safety factor over the scheduled process.</P>
              <P>(e) Clock times on temperature-recording device records shall reasonably correspond to the time of day on the processing records to provide correlation of these records.</P>
              <P>(f) The steam supply to the thermal processing system shall be adequate to the extent needed to ensure that sufficient steam pressure is maintained during thermal processing, regardless of other demands of steam by the plant.</P>
              <P>(g) If mufflers are used on bleeders or vent systems, evidence that the bleeders or vents are operated in a manner that does not significantly impede the removal of air shall be kept on file. This evidence may be in the form of heat distribution data or other satisfactory evidence such as a letter from the manufacturer, the designer, or a competent processing authority.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Deviations in processing, venting, or control of critical factors.</SUBJECT>

              <P>Whenever any process is less than the scheduled process or when critical factors are out of control for any low-acid food or container system as disclosed <PRTPAGE P="375"/>from records by processor check or otherwise, the commerical processor of that low-acid food shall either fully reprocess that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of the reprocessing conditions or, alternatively, must set aside that portion of the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential public health significance. Such evaluation shall be made by a competent processing authority and shall be in accordance with procedures recognized by competent processing authorities as being adequate to detect any potential hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation demonstrates that the product had been given a thermal process that rendered it free of microorganisms of potential public health significance, the product set aside shall be either fully reprocessed to render it commercially sterile or destroyed. A record shall be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. Either upon completion of full reprocessing and the attainment of commerical sterility or after the determination that no significant potential for public health hazard exists, that portion of the product involved may be shipped in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved shall be destroyed. All process deviations involving a failure to satisfy the minimum requirements of the scheduled process, including emergencies arising from a jam or breakdown of a continuous agitating retort necessitating cooling the retort for repairs, shall be recorded and made the subject of a separate file (or a log identifying the appropriate data) detailing those deviations and the actions taken.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Processes and controls.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Processing operations.</E> The manufacturer shall employ appropriate quality control procedures to ensure that finished foods do not present a health hazard.</P>
              <P>(1) Acidified foods shall be so manufactured, processed, and packaged that a finished equilibrium pH value of 4.6 or lower is achieved within the time designated in the scheduled process and maintained in all finished foods. Manufacturing shall be in accordance with the scheduled process. Acidified foods shall be thermally processed to an extent that is sufficient to destroy the vegetative cells of microorganisms of public health significance and those of nonhealth significance capable of reproducing in the food under the conditions in which the food is stored, distributed, retailed and held by the user. Permitted preservatives may be used to inhibit reproduction of microorganisms of nonhealth significance (in lieu of thermal processing).</P>
              <P>(2) Sufficient control, including frequent testing and recording of results, shall be exercised so that the finished equilibrium pH values for acidified foods are not higher than 4.6. Measurement of acidity of foods in-process may be made by potentiometric methods, titratable acidity, or colorimetric methods. If the finished equilibrium pH of the food is above 4.0, the measurement of the finished equilibrium pH shall be by a potentiometric method, and the in-process measurements by titration or colorimetry shall be related to the finished equilibrium pH. If the finished equilibrium pH is 4.0 or below, then the measurement of acidity of the final product may be made by any suitable method. Special care should be taken when food ingredients have been subjected to lye, lime, or similar high pH materials.</P>
              <P>(3) Procedures for acidification to attain acceptable equilibrium pH levels in the final food include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Blanching of the food ingredients in acidified aqueous solutions.</P>
              <P>(ii) Immersion of the blanched food in acid solutions. Although immersion of food in an acid solution is a satisfactory method for acidification, care must be taken to ensure that the acid concentration is properly maintained.</P>
              <P>(iii) Direct batch acidification, which can be achieved by adding a known amount of an acid solution to a specified amount of food during acidification.</P>

              <P>(iv) Direct addition of a predetermined amount of acid to individual containers during production. Liquid acids are generally more effective than <PRTPAGE P="379"/>solid or pelleted acids. Care must be taken to ensure that the proper amount of acid is added to each container.</P>
              <P>(v) Addition of acid foods to low-acid foods in controlled proportions to conform to specific formulations.</P>
              <P>(4) Testing and examinations of containers shall occur often enough to ensure that the container suitably protects the food from leakage or contamination.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Coding.</E> Each container or product shall be marked with an identifying code permanently visible to the naked eye. If the container does not permit the code to be embossed or inked, the label may be legibly perforated or otherwise marked, as long as the label is securely affixed to the product container. The required identification shall specify in code the establishment where the product was packed, the product contained therein, and the year, day, and period during which it was packed. The packing period code shall be changed often enough to enable ready identification of lots during their sale and distribution. Codes may be changed periodically on one of the following bases: intervals of 4 to 5 hours; personnel shift changes; or batches, as long as the containers constituting the batch do not represent those processed during more than one personnel shift.</P>

              <P>Whenever any process operation deviates from the scheduled process for any acidified food and/or the equilibrium pH of the finished product is higher than 4.6, the commercial processor of the acidified food shall either: (a) Fully reprocess that portion of the food by a process established by a competent processing authority as adequate to ensure a safe product; (b) thermally process it as a low-acid food under part 113 of this chapter; or (c) set aside that portion of the food involved for further evaluation as to any potential public health significance. The evaluation shall be made by a competent processing authority and shall be in accordance with procedures recognized by competent processing authorities as being adequate to detect any potential hazard to public health. Unless the evaluation demonstrates that the food has undergone a process that has rendered it safe, the food set aside shall either be fully reprocessed to render it safe, or be destroyed. A record shall be made of the procedures used in the evaluation and the results. Either upon completion of full reprocessing and the attainment of a safe food, or after the determination that no significant potential for public health hazard exists, that portion of the food involved may be shipped in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the food involved shall be destroyed.</P>

              <SECTNO>§ 114.90</SECTNO>
              <SUBJECT>Methodology.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Methods that may be used to determine pH or acidity for acidified foods include, but are not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Potentiometric method for the determination of pH</E>—(1) <E T="03">Principles.</E> The term “pH” is used to designate the intensity or degree of acidity. The value of pH, the logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion concentration in solution, is determined by measuring the difference in potential between two electrodes immersed in a sample solution. A suitable system consists of a potentiometer, a glass electrode, and a reference electrode. A precise pH determination can be made by making an electromotive force (emf) measurement of a standard buffer solution whose pH is known, and then comparing that measurement to an emf measurement of a sample of the solution to be tested.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Instruments.</E> The primary instrument for use in pH determination is the pH meter or potentiometer. For most work, an instrument with a direct-reading pH scale is necessary. Battery and line-operated instruments are available commercially. If the line voltage is unstable, line-operated instruments should be fitted with voltage regulators to eliminate drifting of <PRTPAGE P="380"/>meter-scale readings. Batteries should be checked frequently to ensure proper operation of battery operated instruments. An instrument using an expanded unit scale or a digital readout system is preferred since it allows more precise measurements.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Electrodes.</E> The typical pH meter is equipped with a glass membrane electrode and a reference electrode or a single probe combination electrode. Various types of electrodes designed for specific uses are available. The most commonly used reference electrode is the calomel electrode, which incorporates a salt bridge filled with saturated potassium chloride solution.</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Care and use of electrodes.</E> Calomel electrodes should be kept filled with saturated potassium chloride solution or other solution specified by the manufacturer because they may become damaged if they are allowed to dry out. For best results, electrodes should be soaked in buffer solution, distilled or deionized water, or other liquid specified by the manufacturer for several hours before using and kept ready by storing with tips immersed in distilled water or in buffer solution used for standardization. Electrodes should be rinsed with water before immersing in the standard buffers and rinsed with water or the solution to be measured next between sample determinations. A lag in meter response may indicate aging effects or fouling of the electrodes, and cleaning and rejuvenation of the electrodes may be necessary and may be accomplished by placing the electrodes in 0.1 molar sodium hydroxide solution for 1 minute and then transferring them to 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid solution for 1 minute. The cycle should be repeated two times, ending with the electrodes in the acid solution. The electrodes should then be thoroughly rinsed with water and blotted with soft tissue before proceeding with the standardization.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Temperature.</E> To obtain accurate results, a uniform temperature should be maintained for the electrodes, the standard buffer solutions, and the samples. Tests should be made at a temperature between 20° and 30 °C, the optimum being 25 °C. Any temperature determinations made without meter compensation may affect pH values. An automatic temperature compensator may be used.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Accuracy.</E> The accuracy of most pH meters is stated to be approximately 0.1 pH unit, and reproducibility is usually ±0.05 pH unit or less. Some meters permit the expansion of any pH unit range to cover the entire scale and have an accuracy of approximately ±0.01 pH unit and a reproducibility of ±0.005 pH units.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">General procedure for determining pH.</E> When operating an instrument, the operator should use the manufacturer's instructions and should observe the following techniques for pH determinations:</P>
              <P>(i) Switch the instrument on and allow the electronic components to warm up and stabilize before proceeding.</P>

              <P>(ii) Standardize the instrument and electrodes with commercially prepared standard 4.0 pH buffer or with freshly prepared 0.05 molar potassium acid phthalate buffer solution prepared as outlined in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), section 50.007(c), under “Buffer Solutions for Calibration of pH Equipment—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_ regulations/ibr_locations.html.</E> Note the temperature of the buffer solution and set the temperature compensator control at the observed temperature (room temperature is near 25 °C).</P>
              <P>(iii) Rinse the electrodes with water and blot, but do not wipe, with soft tissue.</P>

              <P>(iv) Immerse the tips in the buffer solution and take the pH reading, allowing about 1 minute for the meter to stabilize. Adjust the standardization control so that the meter reading corresponds to the pH of the known buffer (for example, 4.0) for the temperature observed. Rinse the electrodes with <PRTPAGE P="381"/>water and blot with soft tissue. Repeat procedure with fresh portions of buffer solution until the instrument remains in balance on two successive trials. To check the operation of the pH meter, check the pH reading using another standard buffer such as one having a pH of 7.0, or check it with freshly prepared 0.025 molar phosphate solution prepared as outlined in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 50.007(e), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. Expanded scale pH meters may be checked with pH 3.0 or pH 5.0 standard buffers. Buffers and instruments can be further checked by comparison with values obtained with a second properly standardized instrument.</P>
              <P>(v) Indicating electrodes may be checked for proper operation by first using an acid buffer and then a base buffer. First standardize the electrodes using a pH 4.0 buffer at or near 25 °C. Standardization control should be adjusted so that the meter reads exactly 4.0. Electrodes should be rinsed with water, then blotted and immersed in a pH 9.18 borax buffer prepared as outlined in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 50.007(f), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The pH reading should be within ±0.3 units of the 9.18 value.</P>
              <P>(vi) The pH meter can be tested for proper operation by shorting the glass and reference electrode inputs, thereby reducing the voltage to zero. In some meters this shorting is done by switching the instrument to standby, and in other instruments by use of a shorting strap. With the instrument shorted out, standardization control should be turned from one extreme to another. This operation should produce a deflection greater than ±1.5 pH unit from center scale.</P>
              <P>(5) <E T="03">Determining pH on samples.</E> (i) Adjust the temperature of the sample to room temperature (25 °C), and set the temperature compensator control to the observed temperature. With some expanded scale instruments, the sample temperature must be the same as the temperature of the buffer solution used for the standardization.</P>
              <P>(ii) Rinse and blot the electrodes. Immerse the electrodes in the sample and take the pH reading, allowing 1 minute for the meter to stabilize. Rinse and blot the electrodes and repeat on a fresh portion of sample. Oil and grease from the samples may coat the electrodes; therefore, it is advisable to clean and standardize the instrument frequently. When oily samples cause fouling problems, it may become necessary to rinse the electrodes with ethyl ether.</P>
              <P>(iii) Determine two pH values on the well-mixed sample. These readings should agree with one another to indicate that the sample is homogeneous. Report values to the nearest 0.05 pH unit.</P>
              <P>(6) <E T="03">Preparation of samples.</E> Some food products may consist of a mixture of liquid and solid components that differ in acidity. Other food products may be semisolid in character. The following are examples of preparation procedures for pH testing for each of these categories:</P>
              <P>(i) <E T="03">Liquid and solid component mixtures.</E> Drain the contents of the container for 2 minutes on a U.S. standard No. 8 sieve (preferably stainless steel) inclined at a 17- to 20-degree angle. Record weight of the liquid and solid portions and retain each portion separately.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) If the liquid contains sufficient oil to cause electrode fouling, separate the layers with a separatory funnel and retain the aqueous layer. The oil layer may be discarded. Adjust the temperature of the aqueous layer to 25 °C and determine its pH.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Remove the drained solids from the sieve, blend to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25 °C and determine its pH.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Mix aliquots of solid and liquid fractions in the same ratio as found in the original container and blend to a uniform consistency. Adjust the temperature of the blend to 25 °C and determine the equilibriated pH. Alternatively, blend the entire contents of the container to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25 °C, and determine the equilibriated pH.<PRTPAGE P="382"/>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Marinated oil products.</E> Separate the oil from the solid product. Blend the solid in a blender to a paste consistency; it may become necessary to add a small amount of distilled water to some samples to facilitate the blending. A small amount of added water will not alter the pH of most food products, but caution must be exercised concerning poorly buffered foods. No more than 20 milliliters of distilled water should be added to each 100 grams of product. Determine the pH by immersing electrodes in the prepared paste after adjusting the temperature to 25 °C.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Semisolid products.</E> Food products of a semisolid consistency, such as puddings, potato salad, etc., may be blended to a paste consistency, and the pH may be determined on the prepared paste. If more fluidity is required, 10 to 20 milliliters of distilled water may be added to 100 grams of product. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 °C and determine its pH.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Special product mixtures.</E> For special product mixtures such as antipasto, pour off the oil, blend the remaining product to a paste, and determine the pH of the blended paste. If more fluidity is required, add 10 to 20 milliliters of distilled water to each 100 grams of product and blend. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 °C and determine its pH.</P>
              <P>(7) <E T="03">Process pH determination.</E> Obtain sample portions of material for pH determination.</P>
              <P>(i) For process liquids, adjust the temperature of the liquid to 25 °C and determine the pH by immersing the electrodes in the liquid.</P>
              <P>(ii) Drain solid materials on a sieve and blend to a workable paste. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 °C and determine its pH.</P>
              <P>(iii) If enough solid materials are available to make a paste, blend representative aliquots of liquid and solid materials to a workable paste. Adjust the temperature of the prepared paste to 25 °C and determine the equilibrated pH. Alternatively, blend the entire contents of the container to a uniform paste, adjust the temperature of the paste to 25 °C, and determine the equilibrated pH.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Colorimetric methods for the determination of pH.</E> This method may be used in lieu of the potentiometric method if the pH is 4.0 or lower.</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Principle.</E> The colorimetric method for pH involves the use of indicator dyes in solutions that gradually change color over limited pH ranges. An indicator that has the greatest color change at approximately the pH of the sample being tested is selected. The pH is determined by the color of the indicator when exposed to the sample under test.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Indicator solutions.</E> Most indicator solutions are prepared as a 0.04 percent solution of the indicator dye in alcohol. In testing, a few drops of indicator solution are added to 10-milliliter portions of the sample solution. Colors should be compared using a bright background. Approximate determinations can be made on white porcelain spot plates, the test colors being compared thereon with a set of color standards. More accurate colorimetric tests can be made using a comparator block fitted with sets of tubes of standard indicator solutions of known pH.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Indicator paper.</E> A paper tape treated with indicator dye is dipped into the sample solution. Depending upon the pH of the solution, the tape will change color and an approximate pH can be determined by comparison with a standard color chart.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Titratable acidity.</E> Acceptable methods for determining titratable acidity are described in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 22.060, under “Titratable Acidity—Official Final Action,” for “Indicator Method,” and section 22.061 for “Glass Electrode Method—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section. The procedure for preparing and standardizing the sodium hydroxide solution is described in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), sections 50.032-50.035, under “Sodium Hydroxide—Official Final Action” by the “Standard <PRTPAGE P="383"/>Potassium Hydroxide Phthalate Method,” which is also incorporated by reference and available as set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</P>

            <SUBJECT>Refrigeration of shell eggs held for retail distribution.</SUBJECT>
            <P>(a) For purposes of this section a “retail establishment” is an operation that stores, prepares, packages, serves, vends, or otherwise provides food for human consumption directly to consumers.</P>
            <P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, all shell eggs, whether in intrastate or interstate commerce, held for retail distribution:</P>
            <P>(1) Shall promptly be placed under refrigeration as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section upon receipt at a retail establishment, except that, when short delays are unavoidable, the eggs shall be placed under refrigeration, as soon as reasonably possible; and</P>
            <P>(2) Shall be stored and displayed under refrigeration at an ambient temperature not greater than 7.2 °C (45 °F) while held at a retail establishment.</P>

            <P>(c) Shell eggs that have been specifically processed to destroy all viable <E T="03">Salmonella</E> shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.</P>

            <P>(d) Under sections 311 and 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), any State or locality that is willing and able to assist the agency in the enforcement of paragraph (b) of this section, and is authorized to inspect or regulate retail establishments, may, in its own jurisdiction, enforce paragraph (b) of this section through inspections under paragraph (f) of this section and through administrative enforcement remedies identified in paragraph (e) of this section until FDA notifies the State or locality in writing that such assistance is no longer needed. When providing assistance under paragraph (e) of this section, a State or locality may follow the hearing procedures set out in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii) through (e)(2)(iv) of this section, substituting, where necessary, appropriate State or local officials for designated FDA officials or may utilize State or local hearing procedures if such procedures satisfy due process.<PRTPAGE P="384"/>
            </P>
            <P>(e) This section is established under authority of both the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and the PHS Act. Under the act, the agency can enforce the food adulteration provisions under 21 U.S.C. 331, 332, 333, and 334. However, 42 U.S.C. 264 provides for the issuance of implementing enforcement regulations; therefore, FDA has established the following administrative enforcement procedures for the diversion or destruction of shell eggs and for informal hearings under the PHS Act:</P>

            <P>(1) Upon finding that any shell eggs have been held in violation of this section, an authorized FDA representative or a State or local representative in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section may order such eggs to be diverted, under the supervision of said representative, for processing in accordance with the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA) (21 U.S.C. 1031 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of the FDA, or, if applicable, of the State or locality in accordance with the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Order for diversion or destruction.</E> Any division office of FDA or any State or local agency acting under paragraph (d) of this section, upon finding shell eggs held in violation of this section, may serve upon the person in whose possession such eggs are found a written order that such eggs be diverted, under the supervision of an officer or employee of the issuing entity, for processing in accordance with the EPIA (21 U.S.C. 1031 <E T="03">et seq.</E>) or destroyed by or under the supervision of said division office, within 10 working days from the date of receipt of the order.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Issuance of order.</E> The order shall include the following information:</P>
            <P>(A) A statement that the shell eggs identified in the order are subject to diversion for processing in accordance with the EPIA or destruction;</P>
            <P>(B) A detailed description of the facts that justify the issuance of the order;</P>
            <P>(C) The location of the eggs;</P>
            <P>(D) A statement that these eggs shall not be sold, distributed, or otherwise disposed of or moved except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section;</P>
            <P>(E) Identification or description of the eggs;</P>
            <P>(F) The order number;</P>
            <P>(G) The date of the order;</P>
            <P>(H) The text of this entire section;</P>
            <P>(I) A statement that the order may be appealed by written appeal or by requesting an informal hearing;</P>
            <P>(J) The name and phone number of the person issuing the order; and</P>
            <P>(K) The location and telephone number of the office or agency and the name of its director.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Approval of Division Director.</E> An order, before issuance, shall be approved by the FDA Division Director in whose division the shell eggs are located. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval shall be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum as soon as possible.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Labeling or marking of shell eggs under order.</E> An FDA, State, or local agency representative issuing an order under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall label or mark the shell eggs with official tags that include the following information:</P>
            <P>(A) A statement that the shell eggs are detained in accordance with regulations issued under section 361(a) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 264(a)).</P>
            <P>(B) A statement that the shell eggs shall not be sold, distributed or otherwise disposed of or moved except, after notifying the issuing entity in writing, to:</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">1</E>) Divert them for processing in accordance with the EPIA or destroy them; or</P>
            <P>(<E T="03">2</E>) Move them to an another location for holding pending appeal.</P>
            <P>(C) A statement that the violation of the order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 368 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 271).</P>
            <P>(D) The order number and the date of the order, and the name of the government representative who issued the order.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Sale or other disposition of shell eggs under order.</E> After service of the order, the person in possession of the shell eggs that are the subject of the order shall not sell, distribute, or otherwise dispose of or move any eggs subject to the order unless and until the notice is withdrawn after an appeal except, after <PRTPAGE P="385"/>notifying FDA's division office or, if applicable, the State or local agency in writing, to:</P>
            <P>(A) Divert or destroy them as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section; or</P>
            <P>(B) Move them to another location for holding pending appeal.</P>
            <P>(2) The person on whom the order for diversion or destruction is served may either comply with the order or appeal the order to an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director in accordance with the following procedures:</P>
            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal of a detention order.</E> Any appeal shall be submitted in writing to FDA's Division Director in whose division the shell eggs are located within 5 working days of the issuance of the order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, the hearing shall be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or, if requested by the appellant, at a later date, which shall not be later than 20 calendar days after the issuance of the order. The order may also be appealed within the same period of 5 working days by any other person having an ownership or proprietary interest in such shell eggs. The appellant of an order shall state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the shell eggs.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Summary decision.</E> A request for a hearing may be denied, in whole or in part and at any time after a request for a hearing has been submitted, if the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact has been raised by the material submitted in connection with the hearing or from matters officially noticed. If the presiding FDA official determines that a hearing is not justified, written notice of the determination will be given to the parties explaining the reason for denial.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Informal hearing.</E> Appearance by any appellant at the hearing may be by mail or in person, with or without counsel. The informal hearing shall be conducted by the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director, and a written summary of the proceedings shall be prepared by the presiding FDA official.</P>
            <P>(A) The presiding FDA official may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and this section. The presiding FDA official has the power to take such actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and to conduct an informal, fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements concerning the conduct of hearings.</P>
            <P>(B) Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the information and reasons supporting it, and may present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing may then present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. All parties may conduct reasonable examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.</P>
            <P>(C) The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but any party may comment upon or rebut any information and views presented by another party.</P>
            <P>(D) The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with the presiding FDA official's report of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(E) The presiding FDA official shall prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the presiding FDA official may give the parties the opportunity to review and comment on the report of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(F) The presiding FDA official shall include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and shall include a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Written appeal.</E> If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a hearing, the presiding <PRTPAGE P="386"/>FDA official shall render a decision on the appeal affirming or revoking the detention within 5-working days after the receipt of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Presiding FDA official's decision.</E> If, based on the evidence presented at the hearing or by the appellant in a written appeal, the presiding FDA official finds that the shell eggs were held in violation of this section, he shall affirm the order that they be diverted, under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA for processing under the EPIA or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA; otherwise, the presiding FDA official shall issue a written notice that the prior order is withdrawn. If the presiding FDA official affirms the order, he shall order that the diversion or destruction be accomplished within 10-working days from the date of the issuance of his decision. The presiding FDA official's decision shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision. The decision of the presiding FDA official shall constitute final agency action, reviewable in the courts.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">No appeal.</E> If there is no appeal of the order and the person in possession of the shell eggs that are subject to the order fails to divert or destroy them within 10 working days, or if the demand is affirmed by the presiding FDA official after an appeal and the person in possession of such eggs fails to divert or destroy them within 10 working days, FDA's division office or appropriate State or local agency may designate an officer or employee to divert or destroy such eggs. It shall be unlawful to prevent or to attempt to prevent such diversion or destruction of the shell eggs by the designated officer or employee.</P>
            <P>(f) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> Persons engaged in retail distribution of shell eggs shall permit authorized representatives of FDA to make at any reasonable time such inspection of the retail establishment in which shell eggs are being held, including inspection and sampling of such eggs and the equipment in which shell eggs are held and any records relating to such equipment or eggs, as may be necessary in the judgement of such representatives to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. Inspections may be made with or without notice and will ordinarily be made during regular business hours.</P>
            <P>(g) <E T="03">Preemption.</E> No State or local governing entity shall establish or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement allowing refrigeration of unpasteurized shell eggs at retail establishments at any temperature greater than 7.2 °C (45 °F).</P>

              <P>(b) The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under this subpart be completed within 1-calendar day, as appropriate.</P>
              <P>(c) FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) The order withdrawing an exemption under §§ 117.254 and 117.257, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) A request for a hearing under this subpart must be addressed to the FDA Division Director (or, in the case of a foreign facility, the Director of the Office of Compliance in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition) as provided in the order withdrawing an exemption.</P>
              <P>(3) Section 117.274, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees who preside at hearings under this subpart.</P>
              <P>(4) Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer must prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. The presiding officer must include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and must include a proposed decision, with a statement of reasons. The hearing participant may review and comment on the presiding officer's report within 2-calendar days of issuance of the report. The presiding officer will then issue the final decision.</P>
              <P>(5) Section 16.80(a)(4) of this chapter does not apply to a regulatory hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer's report of the hearing and any comments on the report by the hearing participant under § 117.270(c)(4) are part of the administrative record.</P>
              <P>(6) No party shall have the right, under § 16.119 of this chapter to petition the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for reconsideration or a stay of the presiding officer's final decision.</P>
              <P>(7) If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of an order withdrawing an exemption, the hearing must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under a regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that § 16.95(b) of this chapter does not apply to a hearing under this subpart. With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the administrative record of the hearing specified in §§ 16.80(a)(1) through (3) and (a)(5) of this chapter and 117.270(c)(5) constitutes the exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision.

            <SUBJECT>Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) prevention measures.</SUBJECT>
            <P>You must follow the SE prevention measures set forth in this section. In addition, you must have and implement a written SE prevention plan that is specific to each farm where you produce eggs and that includes, at a minimum, the following SE prevention measures:</P>
            <P>(a) <E T="03">Pullets.</E> You must procure pullets that are SE monitored or raise pullets under SE monitored conditions. “SE monitored” means the pullets are raised under SE control conditions that prevent SE, including:</P>
            <P>(1) <E T="03">Procurement of chicks.</E> Chicks are procured from SE-monitored breeder flocks that meet the National Poultry Improvement Plan's standards for “U.S. S. Enteritidis Clean” status (9 CFR 145.23(d)) or equivalent standard;</P>
            <P>(2) <E T="03">Environmental testing.</E> (i) The pullet environment is tested for SE when pullets are 14 to 16 weeks of age;</P>
            <P>(ii) If the environmental test required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is negative, you do not need to perform any additional testing of those birds or their environment until the environmental test at 40 to 45 weeks of age specified in § 118.5(a); and</P>
            <P>(iii) If the environmental test required in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is positive, you must begin egg testing, as specified in § 118.6, within 2 weeks of the start of egg laying.</P>
            <P>(3) <E T="03">Cleaning and disinfection.</E> If the environmental test required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is positive, the pullet environment is cleaned and disinfected, to include:</P>
            <P>(i) Removal of all visible manure;</P>
            <P>(ii) Dry cleaning the positive pullet house to remove dust, feathers, and old feed; and</P>
            <P>(iii) Following cleaning, disinfection of the positive pullet house with spray, aerosol, fumigation, or another appropriate disinfection method.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Biosecurity.</E> As part of this program, you must take steps to ensure that there is no introduction or transfer of SE into or among poultry houses. Among such biosecurity measures you must, at a minimum:</P>
            <P>(1) Limit visitors on the farm and in the poultry houses;</P>
            <P>(2) Maintain practices that will protect against cross contamination when equipment is moved among poultry houses;</P>
            <P>(3) Maintain practices that will protect against cross contamination when persons move between poultry houses;</P>
            <P>(4) Prevent stray poultry, wild birds, cats, and other animals from entering poultry houses; and</P>
            <P>(5) Not allow employees to keep birds at home.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">Rodents, flies, and other pest control.</E> As part of this program, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Monitor for rodents by visual inspection and mechanical traps or glueboards or another appropriate monitoring method and, when monitoring indicates unacceptable rodent activity within a poultry house, use appropriate methods to achieve satisfactory rodent control;</P>
            <P>(2) Monitor for flies by spot cards, Scudder grills, or sticky traps or another appropriate monitoring method and, when monitoring indicates unacceptable fly activity within a poultry house, use appropriate methods to achieve satisfactory fly control.</P>
            <P>(3) Remove debris within a poultry house and vegetation and debris outside a poultry house that may provide harborage for pests.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Cleaning and disinfection.</E> You must clean and disinfect the poultry house according to these procedures before new laying hens are added to the house, if you have had an environmental test or an egg test that was positive for SE at any point during the life of a flock that was housed in the poultry house prior to depopulation. As part of the cleaning and disinfection procedures, you must:</P>
            <P>(1) Remove all visible manure;</P>
            <P>(2) Dry clean the positive poultry house to remove dust, feathers, and old feed; and</P>
            <P>(3) Following cleaning, disinfect the positive poultry house with spray, aerosol, fumigation, or another appropriate disinfection method.</P>
            <P>(e) <E T="03">Refrigeration.</E> You must hold and transport eggs at or below 45 °F ambient temperature beginning 36 hours after time of lay. If the eggs are to be processed as table eggs and are not processed for the ultimate consumer within 36 hours from the time of lay <PRTPAGE P="429"/>and, therefore, are held and transported as required at or below 45 °F ambient temperature, then you may then hold them at room temperature for no more than 36 hours just prior to processing to allow an equilibration step to temper the eggs.</P>

            <P>(a) <E T="03">Environmental testing when laying hens are 40 to 45 weeks of age.</E> As one indicator of the effectiveness of your SE prevention plan, you must perform environmental testing for SE (as described in §§ 118.7 and 118.8) in a poultry house when any group of laying hens constituting the flock within the poultry house is 40 to 45 weeks of age.</P>
            <P>(1) If an environmental test at 40 to 45 weeks is negative and your laying hens do not undergo induced molting, then you do not need to perform any additional environmental testing within that poultry house, unless the poultry house contains more than one group of laying hens. If the poultry house contains more than one group of laying hens, then you must perform environmental testing on the poultry house when each group of laying hens is 40 to 45 weeks of age.</P>
            <P>(2) If the environmental test at 40 to 45 weeks is positive, then you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Review and make any necessary adjustments to your SE prevention plan to ensure that all measures are being properly implemented and</P>
            <P>(ii) Begin egg testing (described in § 118.6), unless you divert eggs to treatment as defined in § 118.3 for the life of the flock in that poultry house. Results of egg testing must be obtained within 10-calendar days of receiving notification of the positive environmental test.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Environmental testing after an induced molting period.</E> If you induce a molt in a flock or a group in a flock, you must perform environmental testing for SE in the poultry house at 4 to 6 weeks after the end of any molting process.</P>
            <P>(1) If an environmental test at 4 to 6 weeks after the end of the molting process is negative and none of your laying hens in that poultry house is molted again, then you do not need to perform any additional environmental testing in that poultry house. Each time a flock or group within the flock is molted, you must perform environmental testing in the poultry house at 4 to 6 weeks after the end of the molting process.</P>
            <P>(2) If the environmental test at 4 to 6 weeks after the end of a molting process is positive, then you must:</P>
            <P>(i) Review and make any necessary adjustments to your SE prevention plan to ensure that all measures are being properly implemented; and</P>
            <P>(ii) Begin egg testing (described in § 118.6), unless you divert eggs to treatment as defined in § 118.3 for the life of the flock in that poultry house. Results of egg testing, when conducted, must be available within 10-calendar days of receiving notification of the positive environmental test.</P>

            <P>(i) <E T="03">Appeal of a detention order.</E> Any appeal must be submitted in writing to FDA's Division Director in whose division the shell eggs are located within 5 working days of the issuance of the order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, the hearing must be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or, if requested by the appellant, at a later date, which must not be later than 20 calendar days after the issuance of the order. The order may also be appealed within the same period of 5 working days by any other person having an ownership or proprietary interest in such shell eggs. The appellant of an order must state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the shell eggs.</P>
            <P>(ii) <E T="03">Summary decision.</E> A request for a hearing may be denied, in whole or in part and at any time after a request for a hearing has been submitted, if the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director determines that no genuine and substantial issue of fact has been raised by the material submitted in connection with the hearing or from matters officially noticed. If the presiding FDA official determines that a hearing is not justified, written notice of the determination will be given to the parties explaining the reason for denial.</P>
            <P>(iii) <E T="03">Informal hearing.</E> Appearance by any appellant at the hearing may be by mail or in person, with or without counsel. The informal hearing must be conducted by the Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director, and a written summary of the proceedings must be prepared by the presiding FDA official.</P>
            <P>(A) The presiding FDA official may direct that the hearing be conducted in any suitable manner permitted by law and by this section. The presiding FDA official has the power to take such actions and make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and to conduct an informal, fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce the requirements concerning the conduct of hearings.</P>
            <P>(B) Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the action that is the subject of the hearing, together with the information and reasons supporting it, and may present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the hearing may then present oral or written information relevant to the hearing. All parties may conduct reasonable examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.</P>

            <P>(C) The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and views will be made or considered, but any party may comment upon or rebut any information and views presented by another party.<PRTPAGE P="436"/>
            </P>
            <P>(D) The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with the presiding FDA official's report of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(E) The presiding FDA official must prepare a written report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached to the report. Whenever time permits, the presiding FDA official may give the parties the opportunity to review and comment on the report of the hearing.</P>
            <P>(F) The presiding FDA official must include as part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and must include a recommended decision, with a statement of reasons.</P>
            <P>(iv) <E T="03">Written appeal.</E> If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a hearing, the presiding FDA official must render a decision on the appeal affirming or revoking the detention order within 5-working days after the receipt of the appeal.</P>
            <P>(v) <E T="03">Presiding FDA official's decision.</E> If, based on the evidence presented at the hearing or by the appellant in a written appeal, the presiding FDA official finds that the shell eggs were produced or held in violation of this section, he must affirm the order that they be diverted, under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA for processing under the EPIA or by a treatment that achieves at least a 5-log destruction of SE or destroyed by or under the supervision of an officer or employee of FDA; otherwise, the presiding FDA official must issue a written notice that the prior order is withdrawn. If the presiding FDA official affirms the order, he must order that the diversion or destruction be accomplished within 10-working days from the date of the issuance of his decision. The presiding FDA official's decision must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision. The decision of the presiding FDA official constitutes final agency action, subject to judicial review.</P>
            <P>(vi) <E T="03">No appeal.</E> If there is no appeal of the order and the person in possession of the shell eggs that are subject to the order fails to divert or destroy them within 10 working days, or if the demand is affirmed by the presiding FDA official after an appeal and the person in possession of such eggs fails to divert or destroy them within 10 working days, FDA's division office or, if applicable, the State or local representative may designate an officer or employee to divert or destroy such eggs. It shall be unlawful to prevent or to attempt to prevent such diversion or destruction of the shell eggs by the designated officer or employee.</P>
            <P>(b) <E T="03">Inspection.</E> Persons engaged in production of shell eggs must permit authorized representatives of FDA to make, at any reasonable time, an inspection of the egg production establishment in which shell eggs are being produced. Such inspection includes the inspection and sampling of shell eggs and the environment, the equipment related to production of shell eggs, the equipment in which shell eggs are held, and examination and copying of any records relating to such equipment or eggs, as may be necessary in the judgment of such representatives to determine compliance with the provisions of this section. Inspections may be made with or without notice and will ordinarily be made during regular business hours.</P>
            <P>(c) <E T="03">State and local cooperation.</E> Under sections 311 and 361 of the Public Health Service Act, any State or locality that is willing and able to assist the agency in the enforcement of §§ 118.4 through 118.10, and is authorized to inspect or regulate egg production establishments, may, in its own jurisdiction, enforce §§ 118.4 through 118.10 through inspections under paragraph (b) of this section and through administrative enforcement remedies specified in paragraph (a) of this section unless FDA notifies the State or locality in writing that such assistance is no longer needed. A state or locality may substitute, where necessary, appropriate State or local officials for designated FDA officials in this section. When providing assistance under paragraph (a) of this section, a State or locality may follow the hearing procedures set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) through (a)(2)(v) of this section, or may <PRTPAGE P="437"/>utilize comparable State or local hearing procedures if such procedures satisfy due process.</P>
            <P>(d) <E T="03">Preemption.</E> No State or local governing entity shall establish, or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement regarding prevention of SE in shell eggs during production, storage, or transportation that is less stringent than those required by this part.</P>

              <P>(a) Each processor shall develop, or have developed for it, a written hazard analysis to determine whether there are food hazards that are reasonably likely to occur for each type of juice processed by that processor and to identify control measures that the processor can apply to control those hazards. The written hazard analysis shall consist of at least the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Identification of food hazards;</P>
              <P>(2) An evaluation of each food hazard identified to determine if the hazard is reasonably likely to occur and thus, constitutes a food hazard that must be addressed in the HACCP plan. A food hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent processor would establish controls because experience, illness data, scientific reports, or other information provide a basis to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that, in the absence of those controls, the food hazard will occur in the particular type of product being processed. This evaluation shall include an assessment of the severity of the illness or injury if the food hazard occurs;</P>

              <P>(3) Identification of the control measures that the processor can apply to control the food hazards identified as reasonably likely to occur in paragraph (a)(2) of this section;<PRTPAGE P="440"/>
              </P>
              <P>(4) Review of the current process to determine whether modifications are necessary; and</P>

              <P>(b) The hazard analysis shall include food hazards that can be introduced both within and outside the processing plant environment, including food hazards that can occur before, during, and after harvest. The hazard analysis shall be developed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with § 120.13 and shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of § 120.12.</P>
              <P>(c) In evaluating what food hazards are reasonably likely to occur, consideration should be given, at a minimum, to the following:</P>

              <P>(5) Decomposition in food where a food hazard has been associated with decomposition;</P>
              <P>(6) Natural toxins;</P>
              <P>(7) Unapproved use of food or color additives;</P>
              <P>(8) Presence of undeclared ingredients that may be allergens; and</P>
              <P>(9) Physical hazards.</P>

              <P>(2) List the critical control points for each of the identified food hazards that is reasonably likely to occur, including as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) Critical control points designed to control food hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and could be introduced inside the processing plant environment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Critical control points designed to control food hazards introduced outside the processing plant environment, including food hazards that occur before, during, and after harvest;</P>

              <P>(a) Processors may develop written corrective action plans, which become part of their HACCP plans in accordance with § 120.8(b)(5), by which processors predetermine the corrective actions that they will take whenever there is a deviation from a critical limit. A corrective action plan that is appropriate for a particular deviation is one that describes the steps to be taken and assigns responsibility for taking those steps, to ensure that:</P>
              <P>(1) No product enters commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation; and</P>
              <P>(2) The cause of the deviation is corrected.</P>
              <P>(b) When a deviation from a critical limit occurs, and the processor does not have a corrective action plan that is appropriate for that deviation, the processor shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Segregate and hold the affected product, at least until the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section are met;</P>

              <P>Each juice processor that relies on treatments that do not come into direct contact with all parts of the juice to achieve the requirements of § 120.24 shall analyze the finished product for biotype I <E T="03">Escherichia coli</E> as follows:</P>
              <P>(a) One 20 milliliter (mL) sample (consisting of two 10 mL subsamples) for each 1,000 gallons of juice produced shall be sampled each production day. If less than 1,000 gallons of juice is produced per day, the sample must be taken for each 1,000 gallons produced but not less than once every 5 working days that the facility is producing that juice. Each subsample shall be taken by randomly selecting a package of juice ready for distribution to consumers.</P>
              <P>(b) If the facility is producing more than one type of juice covered by this section, processors shall take subsamples according to paragraph (a) of this section for each of the covered juice products produced.</P>

              <P>(c) Processors shall analyze each subsample for the presence of <E T="03">E. coli</E> by the <PRTPAGE P="446"/>method entitled “Analysis for <E T="03">Escherichia coli</E> in Citrus Juices—Modification of AOAC Official Method 992.30” or another method that is at least equivalent to this method in terms of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity in detecting <E T="03">E. coli.</E> This method is designed to detect the presence or absence of <E T="03">E. coli</E> in a 20 mL sample of juice (consisting of two 10 mL subsamples). The method is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Sample size.</E> Total-20 mL of juice; perform analysis using two 10 mL aliquots.</P>

              <P>(ii) Next day, transfer 1 mL of preenriched sample into 10 mL of EC Broth, without durham gas vials. After inoculation, aseptically add a ColiComplete SSD disc into each tube.</P>
              <P>(iii) Incubate at 44.5 °C for 18 to 24 hours.</P>

              <P>(iv) Examine the tubes under longwave ultra violet light (366 nm). Fluorescent tubes indicate presence of <E T="03">E. coli.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(v) MUG positive and negative controls should be used as reference in interpreting fluorescence reactions. Use an <E T="03">E. coli</E> for positive control and 2 negative controls—a MUG negative strain and an uninoculated tube media.</P>
              <P>(d) If either 10 mL subsample is positive for <E T="03">E. coli,</E> the 20 mL sample is recorded as positive and the processor shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Review monitoring records for the control measures to attain the 5-log reduction standard and correct those conditions and practices that are not met. In addition, the processor may choose to test the sample for the presence of pathogens of concern.</P>

              <P>(2) If the review of monitoring records or the additional testing indicates that the 5-log reduction standard was not achieved (<E T="03">e.g.,</E> a sample is found to be positive for the presence of a pathogen or a deviation in the process or its delivery is identified), the processor shall take corrective action as set forth in § 120.10.</P>

              <P>(e) If two samples in a series of seven tests are positive for <E T="03">E. coli,</E> the control measures to attain the 5-log reduction standard shall be deemed to be inadequate and the processor shall immediately:</P>
              <P>(1) Until corrective actions are completed, use an alternative process or processes that achieve the 5-log reduction after the juice has been expressed;</P>
              <P>(2) Perform a review of the monitoring records for control measures to attain the 5-log reduction standard. The review shall be sufficiently extensive to determine that there are no trends towards loss of control;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Hazard analysis and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Hazard analysis.</E> Every processor shall conduct, or have conducted for it, a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur for each kind of fish and fishery product processed by that processor and to identify the preventive measures that the processor can apply to control those hazards. Such food safety hazards can be introduced both within and outside the <PRTPAGE P="456"/>processing plant environment, including food safety hazards that can occur before, during, and after harvest. A food safety hazard that is reasonably likely to occur is one for which a prudent processor would establish controls because experience, illness data, scientific reports, or other information provide a basis to conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that it will occur in the particular type of fish or fishery product being processed in the absence of those controls.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">The HACCP plan.</E> Every processor shall have and implement a written HACCP plan whenever a hazard analysis reveals one or more food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, as described in paragraph (a) of this section. A HACCP plan shall be specific to:</P>
              <P>(1) Each location where fish and fishery products are processed by that processor; and</P>
              <P>(2) Each kind of fish and fishery product processed by the processor. The plan may group kinds of fish and fishery products together, or group kinds of production methods together, if the food safety hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and procedures required to be identified and performed in paragraph (c) of this section are identical for all fish and fishery products so grouped or for all production methods so grouped.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">The contents of the HACCP plan.</E> The HACCP plan shall, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) List the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, as identified in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and that thus must be controlled for each fish and fishery product. Consideration should be given to whether any food safety hazards are reasonably likely to occur as a result of the following:</P>
              <P>(i) Natural toxins;</P>
              <P>(ii) Microbiological contamination;</P>
              <P>(iii) Chemical contamination;</P>
              <P>(iv) Pesticides;</P>
              <P>(v) Drug residues;</P>
              <P>(vi) Decomposition in scombroid toxin-forming species or in any other species where a food safety hazard has been associated with decomposition;</P>
              <P>(vii) Parasites, where the processor has knowledge or has reason to know that the parasite-containing fish or fishery product will be consumed without a process sufficient to kill the parasites, or where the processor represents, labels, or intends for the product to be so consumed;</P>
              <P>(viii) Unapproved use of direct or indirect food or color additives; and</P>
              <P>(ix) Physical hazards;</P>
              <P>(2) List the critical control points for each of the identified food safety hazards, including as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards that could be introduced in the processing plant environment; and</P>
              <P>(ii) Critical control points designed to control food safety hazards introduced outside the processing plant environment, including food safety hazards that occur before, during, and after harvest;</P>
              <P>(3) List the critical limits that must be met at each of the critical control points;</P>
              <P>(4) List the procedures, and frequency thereof, that will be used to monitor each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the critical limits;</P>
              <P>(5) Include any corrective action plans that have been developed in accordance with § 123.7(b), to be followed in response to deviations from critical limits at critical control points;</P>
              <P>(6) List the verification procedures, and frequency thereof, that the processor will use in accordance with § 123.8(a);</P>
              <P>(7) Provide for a recordkeeping system that documents the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall contain the actual values and observations obtained during monitoring.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Signing and dating the HACCP plan.</E> (1) The HACCP plan shall be signed and dated, either by the most responsible individual onsite at the processing facility or by a higher level official of the processor. This signature shall signify that the HACCP plan has been accepted for implementation by the firm.</P>
              <P>(2) The HACCP plan shall be dated and signed:</P>
              <P>(i) Upon initial acceptance;</P>
              <P>(ii) Upon any modification; and</P>

              <P>(iii) Upon verification of the plan in accordance with § 123.8(a)(1).<PRTPAGE P="457"/>
              </P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Products subject to other regulations.</E> For fish and fishery products that are subject to the requirements of part 113 or 114 of this chapter, the HACCP plan need not list the food safety hazard associated with the formation of <E T="03">Clostridium botulinum</E> toxin in the finished, hermetically sealed container, nor list the controls to prevent that food safety hazard. A HACCP plan for such fish and fishery products shall address any other food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Sanitation.</E> Sanitation controls may be included in the HACCP plan. However, to the extent that they are monitored in accordance with § 123.11(b) they need not be included in the HACCP plan, and vice versa.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Legal basis.</E> Failure of a processor to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section whenever a HACCP plan is necessary, otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of this part, shall render the fish or fishery products of that processor adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. Whether a processor's actions are consistent with ensuring the safety of food will be determined through an evaluation of the processors overall implementation of its HACCP plan, if one is required.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Corrective actions.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Whenever a deviation from a critical limit occurs, a processor shall take corrective action either by:</P>
              <P>(1) Following a corrective action plan that is appropriate for the particular deviation, or</P>
              <P>(2) Following the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) Processors may develop written corrective action plans, which become part of their HACCP plans in accordance with § 123.6(c)(5), by which they predetermine the corrective actions that they will take whenever there is a deviation from a critical limit. A corrective action plan that is appropriate for a particular deviation is one that describes the steps to be taken and assigns responsibility for taking those steps, to ensure that:</P>
              <P>(1) No product enters commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation; and</P>
              <P>(2) The cause of the deviation is corrected.</P>
              <P>(c) When a deviation from a critical limit occurs and the processor does not have a corrective action plan that is appropriate for that deviation, the processor shall:</P>
              <P>(1) Segregate and hold the affected product, at least until the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section are met;</P>
              <P>(2) Perform or obtain a review to determine the acceptability of the affected product for distribution. The review shall be performed by an individual or individuals who have adequate training or experience to perform such a review. Adequate training may or may not include training in accordance with § 123.10;</P>
              <P>(3) Take corrective action, when necessary, with respect to the affected product to ensure that no product enters commerce that is either injurious to health or is otherwise adulterated as a result of the deviation;</P>
              <P>(4) Take corrective action, when necessary, to correct the cause of the deviation;</P>
              <P>(5) Perform or obtain timely reassessment by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with § 123.10, to determine whether the HACCP plan needs to be modified to reduce the risk of recurrence of the deviation, and modify the HACCP plan as necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) All corrective actions taken in accordance with this section shall be fully documented in records that are subject to verification in accordance with § 123.8(a)(3)(ii) and the recordkeeping requirements of § 123.9.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Overall verification.</E> Every processor shall verify that the HACCP plan is adequate to control food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, and that the plan is being effectively implemented. Verification shall include, at a minimum:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Reassessment of the HACCP plan.</E> A reassessment of the adequacy of the HACCP plan whenever any changes occur that could affect the hazard analysis or alter the HACCP plan in any way or at least annually. Such changes may include changes in the following: <PRTPAGE P="458"/>Raw materials or source of raw materials, product formulation, processing methods or systems, finished product distribution systems, or the intended use or consumers of the finished product. The reassessment shall be performed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with § 123.10. The HACCP plan shall be modified immediately whenever a reassessment reveals that the plan is no longer adequate to fully meet the requirements of § 123.6(c).</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Ongoing verification activities.</E> Ongoing verification activities including:</P>
              <P>(i) A review of any consumer complaints that have been received by the processor to determine whether they relate to the performance of critical control points or reveal the existence of unidentified critical control points;</P>
              <P>(ii) The calibration of process-monitoring instruments; and,</P>
              <P>(iii) At the option of the processor, the performing of periodic end-product or in-process testing.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Records review.</E> A review, including signing and dating, by an individual who has been trained in accordance with § 123.10, of the records that document:</P>
              <P>(i) The monitoring of critical control points. The purpose of this review shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete and to verify that they document values that are within the critical limits. This review shall occur within 1 week of the day that the records are made;</P>
              <P>(ii) The taking of corrective actions. The purpose of this review shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete and to verify that appropriate corrective actions were taken in accordance with § 123.7. This review shall occur within 1 week of the day that the records are made; and</P>
              <P>(iii) The calibrating of any process control instruments used at critical control points and the performing of any periodic end-product or in-process testing that is part of the processor's verification activities. The purpose of these reviews shall be, at a minimum, to ensure that the records are complete, and that these activities occurred in accordance with the processor's written procedures. These reviews shall occur within a reasonable time after the records are made.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Corrective actions.</E> Processors shall immediately follow the procedures in § 123.7 whenever any verification procedure, including the review of a consumer complaint, reveals the need to take a corrective action.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Reassessment of the hazard analysis.</E> Whenever a processor does not have a HACCP plan because a hazard analysis has revealed no food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, the processor shall reassess the adequacy of that hazard analysis whenever there are any changes that could reasonably affect whether a food safety hazard now exists. Such changes may include, but are not limited to changes in: Raw materials or source of raw materials, product formulation, processing methods or systems, finished product distribution systems, or the intended use or consumers of the finished product. The reassessment shall be performed by an individual or individuals who have been trained in accordance with § 123.10.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Recordkeeping.</E> The calibration of process-monitoring instruments, and the performing of any periodic end-product and in-process testing, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) through (iii) of this section shall be documented in records that are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of § 123.9.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sanitary facilities.</SUBJECT>
              <P>Each plant shall provide adequate sanitary facilities including, but not limited to, the following:</P>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Product water and operations water</E>—(1) <E T="03">Product water.</E> The product water supply for each plant shall be from an approved source properly located, protected, and operated and shall be easily accessible, adequate, and of a safe, sanitary quality which shall be in conformance at all times with the applicable laws and regulations of the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Operations water.</E> If different from the product water supply, the operations water supply shall be obtained from an approved source properly located, protected, and operated and shall be easily accessible, adequate, and of a safe, sanitary quality which shall be in conformance at all times with the applicable laws and regulations of the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Product water and operations water from approved sources.</E> (i) Samples of source water from each source in use by the plant are to be taken and analyzed by the plant as often as necessary, but at a minimum frequency of once each year for chemical contaminants and once every 4 years for radiological contaminants. Additionally, source water obtained from other than a public water system is to be sampled and analyzed for total coliform at least once each week. If any coliform organisms are detected, follow-up testing must be conducted to determine whether any of the coliform organisms are <E T="03">Escherichia coli.</E> This sampling is in addition to any performed by government agencies having jurisdiction. Source water found to contain <E T="03">E. coli</E> is not considered water of a safe, sanitary quality as required for use in bottled <PRTPAGE P="464"/>water by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Before a bottler can use source water from a source that has tested positive for <E T="03">E. coli</E>, the bottler must take appropriate measures to rectify or otherwise eliminate the cause of <E T="03">E. coli</E> contamination of that source in a manner sufficient to prevent its reoccurrence. A source previously found to contain <E T="03">E. coli</E> will be considered negative for <E T="03">E. coli</E> after five samples collected over a 24-hour period from the same sampling site that originally tested positive for <E T="03">E. coli</E> are tested and found to be <E T="03">E. coli</E> negative. Records of approval of the source water by government agencies having jurisdiction, records of sampling and analyses for which the plant is responsible, and records describing corrective measures taken in response to a finding of <E T="03">E. coli</E> are to be maintained on file at the plant.</P>
              <P>(ii) Test and sample methods shall be those recognized and approved by the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction over the approval of the water source, and shall be consistent with the minimum requirements set forth in § 165.110(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Analysis of the sample may be performed for the plant by competent commercial laboratories (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State-certified laboratories).</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Source water testing exemptions.</E> (i) Firms that use a public water system for source water may substitute public water system testing results, or certificates showing full compliance with all provisions of EPA National Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Regulations pertaining to chemical contaminants (40 CFR parts 141 and 143), for the testing requirements of § 129.35(a)(3).</P>
              <P>(ii) Firms that do not use a public water system as the source of their water may reduce the frequency of their testing of that source, as well as the number of chemical contaminants for which they test the source water, if they can document that such reduction is consistent with a State-issued waiver under EPA regulations (40 CFR parts 141 and 143).</P>
              <P>(iii) Firms that do not use a public water system as the source of their water and whose source water has not been treated with a chlorine-based disinfectant or ozone do not have to test their source water for the residual disinfectants and DBP's listed in § 165.110(b)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter. Firms that do not use a public water system as the source of their water but whose source water has been treated with a chlorine-based disinfectant or ozone must test their source water for the residual disinfectants and the DBP's listed in § 165.110(b)(4)(iii)(H) that are likely to result from such treatment.</P>
              <P>(iv) The finished bottled water must comply with bottled water quality standards (§ 165.110(b) of this chapter) and section 402(a)(1) and (a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act dealing with adulterated foods.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Air under pressure.</E> Whenever air under pressure is directed at product water or a product water-contact surface, it shall be free of oil, dust, rust, excessive moisture, and extraneous materials; shall not affect the bacteriological quality of the water; and should not adversely affect the flavor, color, or odor of the water.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Locker and lunchrooms.</E> When employee locker and lunchrooms are provided, they shall be separate from plant operations and storage areas and shall be equipped with self-closing doors. The rooms shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition and refuse containers should be provided. Packaging or wrapping material or other processing supplies shall not be stored in locker or lunchrooms.</P>

The procedure and apparatus for these bacteriological tests shall be in conformance with those recognized by the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction. Tests shall be performed either by qualified plant personnel or a competent commercial laboratory.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Compliance procedures.</E> A quality standard for bottled drinking water is established in § 165.110(b) of this chapter. To assure that the plant's production of bottled drinking water complies with the applicable standards, laws, and regulations of the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction, the plant will analyze product samples as follows:</P>

              <P>(1) For bacteriological purposes, take and analyze at least once a week for total coliform a representative sample from a batch or segment of a continuous production run for each type of bottled drinking water produced during a day's production. The representative sample shall consist of primary containers of product or unit packages of product. If any coliform organisms are detected, follow-up testing must be conducted to determine whether any of the coliform organisms are <E T="03">E. coli.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(2) For chemical, physical, and radiological purposes, take and analyze at least annually a representative sample from a batch or segment of a continuous production run for each type of bottled drinking water produced during a day's production. The representtive <PRTPAGE P="467"/>sample(s) consists of primary containers of product of unit packages of product.</P>
              <P>(3) Analyze such samples by methods approved by the government agency or agencies having jurisdiction. The plant shall maintain records of date of sampling, type of product sampled, production code, and results of the analysis.</P>
              <P>(h) <E T="03">Record retention.</E> All records required by §§ 129.1, 129.20, 129.35, 129.37, 129.40, and 129.80 shall be maintained at the plant for not less than 2 years. Plants shall also retain, on file at the plant, current certificates or notifications of approval issued by the government agency or agencies approving the plant's source and supply of product water and operations water. All required documents shall be available for official review at reasonable times.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Definitions and interpretations.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The definitions and interpretations of terms contained in section 201 of the act shall be applicable also to such terms when used in regulations promulgated under the act.</P>
              <P>(b) If a regulation prescribing a definition and standard of identity for a food has been promulgated under section 401 of the act and the name therein specified for the food is used in any other regulation under section 401 or any other provision of the act, such name means the food which conforms to such definition and standard, except as otherwise specifically provided in such other regulation.</P>
              <P>(c) No provision of any regulation prescribing a definition and standard of identity or standard of quality or fill of container under section 401 of the act shall be construed as in any way affecting the concurrent applicability of the general provisions of the act and the regulations thereunder relating to adulteration and misbranding. For example, all regulations under section 401 contemplate that the food and all articles used as components or ingredients thereof shall not be poisonous or deleterious and shall be clean, sound, and fit for food. A provision in such regulations for the use of coloring or flavoring does not authorize such use under circumstances or in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed or whereby the food is made to appear better or of greater value than it is.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Safe and suitable</E> means that the ingredient:</P>
              <P>(1) Performs an appropriate function in the food in which it is used.</P>
              <P>(2) Is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that food.</P>
              <P>(3) Is not a food additive or color additive as defined in section 201 (s) or (t) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as used in that food, or is a food additive or color additive as so defined and is used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 or 721 of the act.</P>

              <P>(e) Section 403(i) of the act requires the listing of all ingredients in standardized foods. All ingredients must be <PRTPAGE P="468"/>listed in accordance with the requirements of part 101 of this chapter, except that where a definition and standard of identity has specific labeling provisions for optional ingredients, optional ingredients may be declared in accordance with those provisions.</P>

              <P>(b) Any petition for a food standard shall show that the proposal, if adopted, would promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.</P>
              <P>(c) Any petition for a food standard shall assert that the petitioner commits himself to substantiate the information in the petition by evidence in a public hearing, if such a hearing becomes necessary.</P>
              <P>(d) If a petitioner fails to appear, or to substantiate the information in his petition, at a public hearing on the matter, the Commissioner may either (1) withdraw the regulation and terminate the proceeding or (2) if he concludes that it is in accordance with the requirements of section 401 of the act, continue the proceeding and introduce evidence to substantiate such information.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Review of Codex Alimentarius food standards.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) All food standards adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission will be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration and will be accepted without change, accepted with change, or not accepted.</P>
              <P>(b) Review of Codex standards will be accomplished in one of the following three ways:</P>

              <P>(1) Any interested person may petition the Commissioner to adopt a Codex standard, with or without change, by proposing a new standard or an appropriate amendment of an existing standard, pursuant to section 401 of the act. Any such petition shall specify any deviations from the Codex standard, and the reasons for any such deviations. The Commissioner shall publish such a petition in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a proposal, with an opportunity for comment, if reasonable grounds are provided in the petition. Any published proposal shall state any deviations from the Codex standard and the stated reasons therefor.</P>

              <P>(2) The Commissioner may on his own initiative propose by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> the adoption of a Codex standard, with or without change, through a new standard or an appropriate amendment to an existing standard, pursuant to section 401 of the act. Any such proposal shall specify any deviations from the Codex standard, and the reasons for any such deviations.</P>

              <P>(3) Any Codex standard not handled under paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section may be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> for review and informal comment. Interested persons shall be requested to comment on the desirability and need for the standard, on the specific provisions of the standard, on additional or different provisions that should be included in the standard, and on any other pertinent points. After reviewing all such comments, the Commissioner either shall publish a proposal to establish a food standard pursuant to section 401 of the act covering the food involved, or shall publish a notice terminating consideration of such a standard.</P>
              <P>(c) All interested persons are encouraged to confer with different interest groups (consumers, industry, the academic community, professional organizations, and others) in formulating petitions or comments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. All such petitions or comments are requested to include a statement of any meetings and discussions that have been held with other interest groups. Appropriate weight will be given by the Commissioner to petitions or comments that reflect a consensus of different interest groups.</P>

              <P>In the following conditions, among others, a food does not conform to the <PRTPAGE P="469"/>definition and standard of identity therefor:</P>
              <P>(a) If it contains an ingredient for which no provision is made in such definition and standard, unless such ingredient is an incidental additive introduced at a nonfunctional and insignificant level as a result of its deliberate and purposeful addition to another ingredient permitted by the terms of the applicable standard and the presence of such incidental additive in unstandardized foods has been exempted from label declaration as provided in § 101.100 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) If it fails to contain any one or more ingredients required by such definition and standard;</P>

              <SUBJECT>Sulfites in standardized food.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Any standardized food that contains a sulfiting agent or combination of sulfiting agents that is functional and provided for in the applicable standard or that is present in the finished food at a detectable level is misbranded unless the presence of the sulfiting agent or agents is declared on the label of the food. A detectable amount of sulfiting agent is 10 parts per million or more of the sulfite in the finished food. The level of sulfite in the finished food will be determined using sections 20.123 through 20.125, “Sulfurous Acid (Total) in Food Modified Monier-Williams Method Final Action” in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 14th ed. (1984), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51, and the refinements of the “Total Sulfurous Acid” procedure in the “Monier-Williams Procedure (with Modifications) for Sulfites in Foods,” which is appendix A to part 101 of this chapter. A copy of sections 20.123 through 20.125 of the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” is available from AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877 , or available for at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              </P>
              <P>(b) Any standardized food that, as a result of actions that are consistent with current good manufacturing practice, contains an indirectly added sulfiting agent that has no functional effect in the food and that would, in the absence of § 101.100(a)(4) of this chapter, be considered to be an incidental additive for purposes of § 130.8, conforms to the applicable definition and standard of identity if the presence of the sulfiting agent is declared on the label of the food.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Requirements for foods named by use of a nutrient content claim and a standardized term.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> The foods prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those foods that substitute (see § 101.13(d) of this chapter) for a standardized food defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter and that use the name of that standardized food in their statement of identity but that do not comply with the standard of identity because of a deviation that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by FDA regulation. The nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 101.13 of this chapter and with the requirements of the regulations in part 101 of this chapter that define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The food shall comply with the relevant standard in all other respects except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Nutrient addition.</E> Nutrients shall be added to the food to restore nutrient levels so that the product is not nutritionally inferior, as defined in § 101.3(e)(4) of this chapter, to the standardized food as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter. The addition of nutrients shall be reflected in the ingredient statement.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Performance characteristics.</E> Deviations from noningredient provisions of the standard of identity (e.g., moisture <PRTPAGE P="470"/>content, food solids content requirements, or processing conditions) are permitted in order that the substitute food possesses performance characteristics similar to those of the standardized food. Deviations from ingredient and noningredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim while maintaining similar performance characteristics as the standardized food, or the food will be deemed to be adulterated under section 402(b) of the act. The performance characteristics (e.g., physical properties, flavor characteristics, functional properties, shelf life) of the food shall be similar to those of the standardized food as produced under parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, except that if there is a significant difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the uses of the food compared to the uses of the standardized food, the label shall include a statement informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., if appropriate, “not recommended for cooking”). Such statement shall comply with the requirements of § 101.13(d) of this chapter. The modified product shall perform at least one of the principal functions of the standardized product substantially as well as the standardized product.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Other ingredients.</E> (1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for by the standard as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter and in paragraph (b) of this section, except that safe and suitable ingredients may be used to improve texture, add flavor, prevent syneresis, extend shelf life, improve appearance, or add sweetness so that the product is not inferior in performance characteristics to the standardized food defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) An ingredient or component of an ingredient that is specifically required by the standard (i.e., a mandatory ingredient) as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source unless the standard, as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, provides for the addition of such ingredient (e.g., vegetable oil shall not replace milkfat in light sour cream).</P>
              <P>(3) An ingredient or component of an ingredient that is specifically prohibited by the standard as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, shall not be added to a substitute food under this section.</P>
              <P>(4) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, shall be present in the product in a significant amount. A significant amount of an ingredient or component of an ingredient is at least that amount that is required to achieve the technical effect of that ingredient in the food.</P>
              <P>(5) Water and fat analogs may be added to replace fat and calories in accordance with § 130.10(c), (d)(1), and (d)(2).</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of a substitute food that complies with all parts of this regulation is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.</P>
              <P>(f) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> (1) Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of part 101 of this chapter and part 130.</P>
              <P>(2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in parts 131 through 169 of this chapter, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredient statement, except that ingredients added to restore nutrients to the product as required in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be identified with an asterisk. The statement “*Ingredient(s) not in regular ___” (fill in name of the traditional standardized food) or “*Ingredient(s) in excess of amount permitted in regular ___” (fill in name of the traditional standardized food) or both as appropriate shall immediately follow the ingredient statement in the same type size.</P>

              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">general method for water capacity of containers</E> means the following method:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a container with lid attached by double seam, cut out the lid without removing or altering the height of the double seam.</P>
              <P>(2) Wash, dry, and weigh the empty container.</P>
              <P>(3) Fill the container with distilled water at 68 °F to <FR>3/16</FR> inch vertical distance below the top level of the container, and weigh the container thus filled.</P>

              <P>(4) Subtract the weight found in paragraph (a)(2) of this section from the weight found in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The difference shall be considered to be the weight of water required to fill the container.
              </P>
              <FP>In the case of a container with lid attached otherwise than by double seam, remove the lid and proceed as directed in paragraphs (a) (2) to (4) of this section, except that under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, fill the container to the level of the top thereof.</FP>
              <P>(b) The term <E T="03">general method for fill of containers</E> means the following method:</P>
              <P>(1) In the case of a container with lid attached by double seam, cut out the lid without removing or altering the height of the double seam.</P>
              <P>(2) Measure the vertical distance from the top level of the container to the top level of the food.</P>
              <P>(3) Remove the food from the container; wash, dry, and weigh the container.</P>
              <P>(4) Fill the container with water to <FR>3/16</FR> inch vertical distance below the top level of the container. Record the temperature of the water, weigh the container thus filled, and determine the weight of the water by subtracting the weight of the container found in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(5) Maintaining the water at the temperature recorded in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, draw off water from the container as filled in paragraph (b)(4) of this section to the level of the food found in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, weigh the container with remaining water, and determine the weight of the remaining water by subtracting the weight of the container found in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>

              <P>(6) Divide the weight of water found in paragraph (b)(5) of this section by the weight of water found in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, and multiply by 100. The result shall be considered to be the percent of the total capacity of the container occupied by the food.
              </P>
              <FP>In the case of a container with lid attached otherwise than by double seam, remove the lid and proceed as directed in paragraphs (b) (2) to (6) of this section, except that under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, fill the container to the level of the top thereof.</FP>

              <P>For the purposes of regulations promulgated under section 401 of the act:</P>
              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">general statement of substandard quality</E> means the statement “Below Standard in Quality Good Food—Not High Grade” printed in two lines of Cheltenham bold condensed caps. The words “Below Standard in Quality” constitute the first line, and the second immediately follows. If the <PRTPAGE P="472"/>quantity of the contents of the container is less than 1 pound, the type of the first line is 12-point, and of the second, 8-point. If such quantity is 1 pound or more, the type of the first line is 14-point, and of the second, 10-point.

              <SUBJECT>Temporary permits for interstate shipment of experimental packs of food varying from the requirements of definitions and standards of identity.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The Food and Drug Administration recognizes that before petitions to amend food standards can be submitted, appropriate investigations of potential advances in food technology sometimes require tests in interstate markets of the advantages to and acceptance by consumers of experimental packs of food varying from applicable definitions and standards of identity prescribed under section 401 of the act.</P>

              <P>(b) It is the purpose of the Food and Drug Administration to permit such tests when it can be ascertained that the sole purpose of the tests is to obtain data necessary for reasonable grounds in support of a petition to amend food standards, that the tests are necessary to the completion or conclusiveness of an otherwise adequate investigation, and that the interests of consumers are adequately safeguarded; permits for such tests shall normally be for a period not to exceed 15 months. The Food and Drug Administration, or good cause shown by the applicant, may provide for a longer test market period. The Food and Drug Administration will therefore refrain from recommending regulatory proceedings under the act on the charge that a food does not conform to an applicable standard, if the person who introduces or causes the introduction of the food into interstate commerce holds an effective permit from the Food and Drug Administration providing specifically for those variations in respect to which the food fails to conform to the applicable definition and standard of identity. The test period will begin on the date the person holding an effective permit from the Food and Drug Administration introduces or causes the introduction of the food covered by the permit into interstate commerce but not later than 3 months after notice of the issuance of the permit is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The Food and Drug Administration shall be notified in writing of the date on which the test period begins as soon as it is determined.</P>
              <P>(c) Any person desiring a permit may file with the Team Leader, Conventional Foods Team, Division of Standards and Labeling Regulations, Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-822), 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, a written application in triplicate containing as part thereof the following:</P>
              <P>(1) Name and address of the applicant.</P>

              <P>(2) A statement of whether or not the applicant is regularly engaged in producing the food involved.<PRTPAGE P="473"/>
              </P>
              <P>(3) A reference to the applicable definition and standard of identity (citing applicable section of regulations).</P>
              <P>(4) A full description of the proposed variation from the standard.</P>
              <P>(5) The basis upon which the food so varying is believed to be wholesome and nondeleterious.</P>
              <P>(6) The amount of any new ingredient to be added; the amount of any ingredient, required by the standard, to be eliminated; any change of concentration not contemplated by the standard; or any change in name that would more appropriately describe the new product under test. If such new ingredient is not a commonly known food ingredient, a description of its properties and basis for concluding that it is not a deleterious substance.</P>
              <P>(7) The purpose of effecting the variation.</P>
              <P>(8) A statement of how the variation is of potential advantage to consumers. The statement shall include the reasons why the applicant does not consider the data obtained in any prior investigations which may have been conducted sufficient to support a petition to amend the standard.</P>
              <P>(9) The proposed label (or an accurate draft) to be used on the food to be market tested. The label shall conform in all respects to the general requirements of the act and shall provide a means whereby the consumer can distinguish between the food being tested and such food complying with the standard.</P>
              <P>(10) The period during which the applicant desires to introduce such food into interstate commerce, with a statement of the reasons supporting the need for such period. If a period longer than 15 months is requested, a detailed explanation of why a 15-month period is inadequate shall be provided.</P>
              <P>(11) The probable amount of such food that will be distributed. The amount distributed should be limited to the smallest number of units reasonably required for a bona fide market test. Justification for the amount requested shall be included.</P>
              <P>(12) The areas of distribution.</P>
              <P>(13) The address at which such food will be manufactured.</P>
              <P>(14) A statement of whether or not such food has been or is to be distributed in the State in which it was manufactured.</P>
              <P>(15) If it has not been or is not to be so distributed, a statement showing why.</P>
              <P>(16) If it has been or is to be so distributed, a statement of why it is deemed necessary to distribute such food in other States.</P>
              <P>(d) The Food and Drug Administration may require the applicant to furnish samples of the food varying from the standard and to furnish such additional information as may be deemed necessary for action on the application.</P>
              <P>(e) If the Food and Drug Administration concludes that the variation may be advantageous to consumers and will not result in failure of the food to conform to any provision of the act except section 403(g), a permit shall be issued to the applicant for interstate shipment of such food. The terms and conditions of the permit shall be those set forth in the application with such modifications, restrictions, or qualifications as the Food and Drug Administration may deem necessary and state in the permit.</P>
              <P>(f) The terms and conditions of the permit may be modified at the discretion of the Food and Drug Administration or upon application of the permittee during the effective period of the permit.</P>
              <P>(g) The Food and Drug Administration may revoke a permit for cause, which shall include but not be limited to the following:</P>
              <P>(1) That the permittee has introduced a food into interstate commerce contrary to the terms and conditions of the permit.</P>
              <P>(2) That the application for a permit contains an untrue statement of a material fact.</P>
              <P>(3) That the need therefor no longer exists.</P>
              <P>(h) During the period within which any permit is effective, it shall be deemed to be included within the terms of any guaranty or undertaking otherwise effective pursuant to the provisions of section 303(c) of the act.</P>

              <P>(i) If an application is made for an extension of the permit, it shall be accompanied by a description of experiments conducted under the permit, <PRTPAGE P="474"/>tentative conclusions reached, and reasons why further experimental shipments are considered necessary. The application for an extension shall be filed not later than 3 months prior to the expiration date of the permit and shall be accompanied by a petition to amend the affected food standard. If the Food and Drug Administration concludes that it will be in the interest of consumers to issue an extension of the time period for the market test, a notice will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> stating that fact. The notice will include an invitation to all interested persons to participate in the market test under the same conditions that applied to the initial permit holder, including labeling and the amount to be distributed, except that the designated area of distribution shall not apply. The extended market test period shall not begin prior to the publication of a notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> granting the extension and shall terminate either on the effective date of an affirmative order ruling on the proposal or 30 days after a negative order ruling on the proposal, whichever the case may be. Any interested person who accepts the invitation to participate in the extended market test shall notify the Food and Drug Administration in writing of that fact, the amount to be distributed, and the area of distribution; and along with such notification, he shall submit the labeling under which the food is to be distributed.</P>

              <P>(j) Notice of the granting or revocation of any permit shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E>
              </P>

              <P>(k) All applications for a temporary permit, applications for an extension of a temporary permit, and related records are available for public disclosure when the notice of a permit or extension thereof is published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> Such disclosure shall be in accordance with the rules established in part 20 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(l) Any person who contests denial, modification, or revocation of a temporary permit shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.</P>

Since section 409(b)(5) of the act requires that the Commissioner publish notice of a petition for the establishment of a food additive regulation within 30 days after filing, notice of a petition relating to a definition and standard of identity shall also be published within that time limitation if it includes a request, so designated, for the establishment of a regulation pertaining to a food additive.</P>
              <P>(b) If a petition for a definition and standard of identity contains a proposal for a food additive regulation, and the petitioner fails to designate it as such, the Commissioner, upon determining that the petition includes a proposal for a food additive regulation, shall so notify the petitioner and shall thereafter proceed in accordance with the regulations in part 171 of this chapter.</P>

Lowfat yogurt, before the addition of bulky flavors, contains not less than 0.5 percent nor more than 2 percent milkfat and not less than 8.25 percent milk solids not fat, and has a titratable acidity of not less than 0.9 percent, expressed as lactic acid. The food may be homogenized and shall be pasteurized or ultra-pasteurized prior to the addition of the bacterial culture. Flavoring ingredients may be added after pasteurization or ultra-pasteurization. To extend the shelf life of the food, lowfat yogurt may be heat treated after culturing is completed, to destroy viable microorganisms.<PRTPAGE P="491"/>

              <SUBJECT>Notice to manufacturers, packers, and distributors of pasteurized blended cheese, pasteurized process cheese, cheese food, cheese spread, and related foods.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Definitions and standards of identity have recently been promulgated under the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a number of foods made in part from cheese, including pasteurized process cheese; pasteurized process cheese with fruits, vegetables, or meats; pasteurized blended cheese; pasteurized process cheese food; pasteurized process cheese spread, and related foods. These standards prescribe the name for each such food. The act requires that this name appear on the label. Many of these names consist of several words. In the past it has been the practice of some manufacturers to subordinate the words “pasteurized,” “blended,” “process,” “food,” and “spread” to give undue prominence to the word “cheese” and to words naming the variety of cheese involved.</P>
              <P>(b) When placing the names of these foods on labels so as to comply with the requirements of section 403 (a), (f), and (g) of the act, all the words forming the name specified by a definition and standard of identity should be given equal prominence. This can readily be accomplished by printing the specified name of the food in letters of the same size, color, and style of type, and with the same background.</P>
              <P>(c) Where the names of optional ingredients are required to appear on the label, the designations of all such ingredients should be given equal prominence. The names of the optional ingredients should appear prominently and conspicuously but should not be displayed with greater prominence than the name of the food. The word “contains” may precede the names of the optional ingredients, and when so used will not be considered as intervening printed matter between name of food and name of optional ingredients required to be placed on the label.</P>
              <P>(d) Where a manufacturer elects to include a label statement of fat and moisture content, the declaration should be on the basis of the food as marketed. A fat declaration on a moisture-free basis is likely to be misleading, and should not be used in labeling.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Asiago fresh and asiago soft cheese.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Asiago fresh cheese, asiago soft cheese, is the food prepared from milk and other ingredients specified in this section, by the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, or by another procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties as the cheese produced when the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is used. It contains not more than 45 percent of moisture, and its solids contain not less than 50 percent of milkfat, as determined by the methods prescribed in § 133.5 (a), (b), and (d). It is cured for not less than 60 days.</P>

              <P>(b) Milk which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Harmless artificial blue or green coloring in a quantity which neutralizes any natural yellow coloring in the curd may be added. Sufficient rennet, or other safe and suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, or both, with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) of the weight of the milk, is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut, stirred, and heated to promote and regulate separation of the whey from the curd. The whey is drained off. When the curd is sufficiently firm it is removed from the kettle or vat, further drained for a short time, packed into hoops, and pressed. The pressed curd is salted in brine and cured in a well-ventilated room. During curing the surface of the cheese is occasionally rubbed with a vegetable oil. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of asiago fresh cheese may be added during the procedure in such quantity that the weight <PRTPAGE P="496"/>of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) For the purposes of this section, the word “milk” means cow's milk, which may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom or by adding thereto one or more of the following: Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk, water in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any concentrated skim milk or nonfat dry milk used.</P>
              <P>(2) Such milk may be bleached by the use of benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate; but the weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more than 0.002 percent of the weight of the milk bleached, and the weight of the potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide used. If milk is bleached in this manner, sufficient vitamin A is added to the curd to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors destroyed in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.</P>
              <P>(d) Safe and suitable antimycotic agent(s), the cumulative levels of which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be added to the surface of the cheese.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as “enzymes”.</P>

It is characterized by the presence of bluish-green mold, <E T="03">Penicillium roque­fortii,</E> throughout the cheese. The minimum milkfat content is 50 percent by weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 46 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. The dairy ingredients used may be pasteurized. Blue cheese is at least 60 days old.</P>

              <P>(2) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be homogenized, bleached, warmed, and is subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture. One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut into smaller portions and allowed to stand for a time. The mixed curd and whey is placed in forms permitting further drainage. While the curd is being placed in forms, spores of the mold <E T="03">Penicillium roque­fortii</E> are added. The forms are turned several times during drainage. When sufficiently drained, the shaped curd is removed from the forms and salted with dry salt or brine. Perforations are then made in the shaped curd, and it is held at a temperature of approximately 50 °F. at 90 to 95 percent relative humidity, until the characteristic mold growth has developed. During storage the surface of the cheese may be scraped to remove surface growth of undesirable microorganisms. Antimycotics may be applied to the <PRTPAGE P="497"/>surface of the whole cheese. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.</P>

The whey is drained off, and the curd is removed to another vat containing hot whey, in which it is soaked for several hours. This whey is withdrawn, the curd is allowed to mat, and is cut into blocks. These are washed in hot whey until the desired elasticity is obtained. The curd is removed from the vat, drained, pressed into oblong forms, dried, and salted in brine, and cured. It may be paraffined. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of caciocavallo siciliano cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.<PRTPAGE P="499"/>

The minimum milkfat content is 50 percent by weight of the solids, and the maximum moisture content is 39 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. If the dairy ingredients used are not pasteurized, the cheese is cured at a temperature of not less than 35 °F for at least 60 days.</P>
              <P>(2) If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of cheddar cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in § 133.5.</P>

              <P>(3) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be warmed, treated with hydrogen peroxide/catalase, and is subjected to the action of a lactic acid-producing bacterial culture. One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is so cut, stirred, and heated with continued stirring, as to promote and regulate the separation of whey and curd. The whey is drained off, and the curd is matted into a cohesive mass. The mass is cut into slabs, which are so piled and handled as to promote the drainage of whey and the development of acidity. The slabs are then cut into pieces, which may be rinsed by sprinkling or pouring water over them, with free and continuous drainage; but the duration of such rinsing is so limited that only the whey on the surface of such pieces is removed. The curd is salted, stirred, further drained, and pressed into forms. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.<PRTPAGE P="500"/>

              <SUBJECT>Hard grating cheeses.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) The cheeses for which definitions and standards of identity are prescribed by this section are hard grating cheeses for which specifically applicable definitions and standards of identity are not prescribed by other sections of this part. They are made from milk and the other ingredients specified in this section, by the procedure set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. They contain not more than 34 percent of moisture, and their solids contain not less than 32 percent of milkfat, as determined by the methods prescribed in § 133.5 (a), (b), and (d). Hard grating cheeses are cured for not less than 6 months.</P>
              <P>(b) Milk, which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria or other harmless flavor-producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Sufficient rennet, rennet paste, extract of rennet paste, or other safe and suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, singly or in any combination (with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity not more than 0.02 percent, calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride, of the weight of the milk) is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass. Harmless artificial coloring may be added. The mass is cut into small particles, stirred, and heated. The curd is separated from the whey, drained, shaped into forms, pressed, salted, and cured. The rind may be colored or rubbed with vegetable oil or both. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of hard grating cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.</P>
              <P>(c) For the purposes of this section, the word “milk” means cow's milk or goat's milk or sheep's milk or mixtures of two or all of these. Such milk may be adjusted by separating part of the fat therefrom or (in the case of cow's milk) by adding one or more of the following: Cream, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, nonfat dry milk; (in the case of goat's milk) the corresponding products from goat's milk; (in the case of sheep's milk) the corresponding products from sheep's milk; water in a quantity sufficient to reconstitute any such concentrated or dried products used.</P>
              <P>(d) Safe and suitable antimycotic agent(s), the cumulative levels of which shall not exceed current good manufacturing practice, may be added to the surface of the cheese.</P>
              <P>(e) The name of each hard grating cheese for which a definition and standard of identity is prescribed by this section is “Hard grating cheese”, preceded or followed by:</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> (1) Gruyere cheese is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. It contains small holes or eyes. It has a mild flavor, due in part to the growth of surface-curing agents. The minimum milkfat content is 45 percent by weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 39 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. The dairy ingredients used may be pasteurized. The cheese is at least 90 days old.</P>
              <P>(2) If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of gruyere cheese is not more than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in § 133.5.</P>
              <P>(3) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be warmed and is subjected to the action of lactic acid-producing and propionic acid-producing bacterial cultures. One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut into particles similar in size to wheat kernels. For about 30 minutes the particles are alternately stirred and allowed to settle. The temperature is raised to about 126 °F. Stirring is continued until the curd becomes firm. The curd is transferred to hoops or forms, and pressed until the desired shape and firmness are obtained. The cheese is surface-salted while held at a temperature of 48° to 54 °F for a few days. It is soaked for 1 day in a saturated salt solution. It is then held for 3 weeks in a salting cellar and wiped every 2 days with brine cloth to insure growth of biological curing agents on the rind. It is then removed to a heating room and held at progressively higher temperatures, finally reaching 65 °F with a relative humidity of 85 to 90 percent, for several weeks, during which time small holes, or so-called eyes, form. The cheese is then stored at a lower temperature for further curing. One or more of the other optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.</P>

It is characterized by a granular texture and a hard and brittle rind. It grates readily. It contains not more than 32 percent of moisture, and its solids contain not less than 32 percent of milkfat, as determined by the methods prescribed in § 133.5 (a), (b), and (d). It is cured for not less than 10 months.</P>
              <P>(b) Milk, which may be pasteurized or clarified or both, and which may be warmed, is subjected to the action of harmless lactic-acid-producing bacteria, present in such milk or added thereto. Sufficient rennet, or other safe and suitable milk-clotting enzyme that produces equivalent curd formation, or both, with or without purified calcium chloride in a quantity not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) of the weight of the milk, is added to set the milk to a semisolid mass. Harmless artificial coloring may be added. The mass is cut into pieces no larger than wheat kernels, heated, and stirred until the temperature reaches between 115 °F and 125 °F. The curd is allowed to settle and is then removed from the kettle or vat, drained for a short time, placed in hoops, and pressed. The pressed curd is removed and salted in brine, or dry-salted. The cheese is cured in a cool, ventilated room. The rind of the cheese may be coated or colored. A harmless preparation of enzymes of animal or plant origin capable of aiding in the curing or development of flavor of parmesan cheese may be added during the procedure, in such quantity that the weight of the solids of such preparation is not more than 0.1 percent of the weight of the milk used.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Swiss and emmentaler cheese.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Description.</E> (1) Swiss cheese, emmentaler cheese, is the food prepared by the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, or by any other procedure which produces a finished cheese having the same physical and chemical properties. It has holes or eyes developed throughout the cheese. The minimum milkfat content is 43 percent by weight of the solids and the maximum moisture content is 41 percent by weight, as determined by the methods described in § 133.5. The dairy ingredients used may be pasteurized. Swiss cheese is at least 60 days old.</P>

              <P>(2) If pasteurized dairy ingredients are used, the phenol equivalent value of 0.25 gram of swiss cheese is not more <PRTPAGE P="544"/>than 3 micrograms as determined by the method described in § 133.5.</P>
              <P>(3) One or more of the dairy ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be bleached, warmed, or treated with hydrogen peroxide/catalase, and is subjected to the action of lactic acid-producing and propionic acid-producing bacterial cultures. One or more of the clotting enzymes specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is added to set the dairy ingredients to a semisolid mass. The mass is cut into particles similar in size to wheat kernels. For about 30 minutes the particles are alternately stirred and allowed to settle. The temperature is raised to about 126 °F. Stirring is continued until the curd becomes firm. The acidity of the whey at this point, calculated as lactic acid, does not exceed 0.13 percent. The curd is transferred to hoops or forms and pressed until the desired shape and firmness are obtained. The cheese is then salted by immersing it in a saturated salt solution for about 3 days. It is then held at a temperature of about 50° to 60 °F. for a period of 5 to 10 days, after which it is held at a temperature of about 75 °F. until it is approximately 30 days old, or until the so-called eyes form. Salt, or a solution of salt in water, is added to the surface of the cheese at some time during the curing process. The cheese is then stored at a lower temperature for further curing. One or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be added during the procedure.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Optional ingredients.</E> The following safe and suitable ingredients may be used:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Dairy ingredients.</E> Milk, nonfat milk, or cream, as defined in § 133.3, used alone or in combination.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Clotting enzymes.</E> Rennet and/or other clotting enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other optional ingredients.</E> (i) Coloring.</P>
              <P>(ii) Calcium chloride in an amount not more than 0.02 percent (calculated as anhydrous calcium chloride) by weight of the dairy ingredients, used as a coagulation aid.</P>
              <P>(iii) Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin, used in curing or flavor development.</P>
              <P>(iv) Antimycotic agents, the cumulative levels of which shall not exceed good manufacturing practice, may be added to the surface of the cheese.</P>
              <P>(v) Benzoyl peroxide or a mixture of benzoyl peroxide with potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate used to bleach the dairy ingredients. The weight of the benzoyl peroxide is not more than 0.002 percent of the weight of the milk being bleached, and the weight of the potassium alum, calcium sulfate, and magnesium carbonate, singly or combined, is not more than six times the weight of the benzoyl peroxide used. If milk is bleached in this manner, vitamin A is added to the curd in such quantity as to compensate for the vitamin A or its precursors destroyed in the bleaching process, and artificial coloring is not used.</P>
              <P>(vi) Hydrogen peroxide, followed by a sufficient quantity of catalase preparation to eliminate the hydrogen peroxide. The weight of the hydrogen peroxide shall not exceed 0.05 percent of the weight of the milk and the weight of the catalase shall not exceed 20 parts per million of the weight of the milk treated.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of the food is “swiss cheese”, or alternatively, “emmentaler cheese”.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) Enzymes of animal, plant, or microbial origin may be declared as “enzymes”; and</P>
              <P>(2) The dairy ingredients may be declared, in descending order of predominance, by the use of the terms “milkfat and nonfat milk” or “nonfat milk and milkfat”, as appropriate.</P>

Except in the case of frozen custard, ice cream contains less than 1.4 percent egg yolk solids by weight of the food, exclusive of the weight of any bulky flavoring ingredients used. Frozen custard shall contain 1.4 percent egg yolk solids by weight of the finished food: <E T="03">Provided, however,</E> That when bulky flavors are added the egg yolk solids content of frozen custard may be reduced in proportion to the amount by weight of the bulky flavors added, but in no case is the content of egg yolk solids in the finished food less than 1.12 percent. A product containing egg yolk solids in excess of 1.4 percent, the maximum set forth in this paragraph for ice cream, may be marketed if labeled as specified by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.<PRTPAGE P="546"/>
              </FP>
              <P>(3) When calculating the minimum amount of milkfat and nonfat milk solids required in the finished food, the solids of chocolate or cocoa used shall be considered a bulky flavoring ingredient. In order to make allowance for additional sweetening ingredients needed when certain bulky ingredients are used, the weight of chocolate or cocoa solids used may be multiplied by 2.5; the weight of fruit or nuts used may be multiplied by 1.4; and the weight of partially or wholly dried fruits or fruit juices may be multiplied by appropriate factors to obtain the original weights before drying and this weight may be multiplied by 1.4.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Optional dairy ingredients.</E> The optional dairy ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are: Cream; dried cream; plastic cream (sometimes known as concentrated milkfat); butter; butter oil; milk; concentrated milk; evaporated milk; sweetened condensed milk; superheated condensed milk; dried milk; skim milk; concentrated skim milk; evaporated skim milk; condensed skim milk; superheated condensed skim milk; sweetened condensed skim milk; sweetened condensed part-skim milk; nonfat dry milk; sweet cream buttermilk; condensed sweet cream buttermilk; dried sweet cream buttermilk; skim milk, that may be concentrated, and from which part or all of the lactose has been removed by a safe and suitable procedure; skim milk in concentrated or dried form that has been modified by treating the concentrated skim milk with calcium hydroxide and disodium phosphate; and whey and those modified whey products (e.g., reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, and whey protein concentrate) that have been determined by FDA to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in this type of food. Water may be added, or water may be evaporated from the mix. The sweet cream buttermilk and the concentrated sweet cream buttermilk or dried sweet cream buttermilk, when adjusted with water to a total solids content of 8.5 percent, has a titratable acidity of not more than 0.17 percent, calculated as lactic acid. The term “milk” as used in this section means cow's milk. Any whey and modified whey products used contribute, singly or in combination, not more than 25 percent by weight of the total nonfat milk solids content of the finished food. The modified skim milk, when adjusted with water to a total solids content of 9 percent, is substantially free of lactic acid as determined by titration with 0.1<E T="03">N</E> NaOH, and it has a Ph value in the range of 8.0 to 8.3.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Optional caseinates.</E> The optional caseinates referred to in paragraph (a) of this section that may be added to ice cream mix containing not less than 20 percent total milk solids are: Casein prepared by precipitation with gums, ammonium caseinate, calcium caseinate, potassium caseinate, and sodium caseinate. Caseinate may be added in liquid or dry form, but must be free of excess alkali.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Optional hydrolyzed milk proteins.</E> One or more of the optional hydrolyzed milk proteins referred to in paragraph (a) of this section may be added as stabilizers at a level not to exceed 3 percent by weight of ice cream mix containing not less that 20 percent total milk solids, provided that any whey and modified whey products used contribute, singly or in combination, not more than 25 percent by weight of the total nonfat milk solids content of the finished food. Further, when hydrolyzed milk proteins are used in the food, the declaration of these ingredients on the food label shall comply with the requirements of § 102.22 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Methods of analysis.</E> The fat content shall be determined by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), sections 16.287 and 16.059, under “Fat, Roese-Gottlieb Method—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference.

              <P>(iv) In the case of two or more fruits or fruit juices, or nut meats, or both, used in combination with artificial flavors simulating the natural flavors and dispersed throughout the food, if the quantity of any fruit or fruit juice or nut meat is less than one-half the applicable percentage specified in paragraph (e)(5) (ii) or (iii) of this section. For example, if a combination ice cream contains less than 5 percent of bananas and less than 1 percent of almonds it would be “artificially flavored banana-almond ice cream”. However, if it contains more than 5 percent of bananas and more than 1 percent of almonds it would be “banana-almond flavored ice cream”.</P>
              <P>(6) If two or more flavors of ice cream are distinctively combined in one package, e.g., “Neapolitan” ice cream, the applicable provisions of this paragraph shall govern each flavor of ice cream comprising the combination.</P>

If the food purports to be or is represented for special dietary use, it shall bear labeling in accordance with the requirements of part 105 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(g) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that the sources of milkfat or milk solids not fat may be declared in descending order of predominance either by the use of all the terms “milkfat and nonfat milk” when one or any combination of two or more of the ingredients listed in § 101.4(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this chapter are used or, alternatively, as permitted in § 101.4 of this chapter. Under section 403(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, artificial color need not be declared in ice cream, except as required by § 101.22(c) or (k) of this chapter. Voluntary declaration of all colors used in ice cream and frozen custard is recommended.</P>

The fruit or fruit juice used may be fresh, frozen, canned, concentrated, or partially or wholly dried. The fruit may be thickened with pectin or other <PRTPAGE P="551"/>optional ingredients. The fruit is prepared by the removal of pits, seeds, skins, and cores, where such removal is usual in preparing that kind of fruit for consumption as fresh fruit. The fruit may be screened, crushed, or otherwise comminuted. It may be acidulated. In the case of concentrated fruit or fruit juices, from which part of the water is removed, substances contributing flavor volatilized during water removal may be condensed and reincorporated in the concentrated fruit or fruit juice. In the case of citrus fruits, the whole fruit, including the peel but excluding the seeds, may be used, and in the case of citrus juice or concentrated citrus juices, cold-pressed citrus oil may be added thereto in an amount not exceeding that which would have been obtained if the whole fruit had been used. The quantity of fruit ingredients used is such that, in relation to the weight of the finished sherbet, the weight of fruit or fruit juice, as the case may be (including water necessary to reconstitute partially or wholly dried fruits or fruit juices to their original moisture content), is not less than 2 percent in the case of citrus sherbets, 6 percent in the case of berry sherbets, and 10 percent in the case of sherbets prepared with other fruits. For the purpose of this section, tomatoes and rhubarb are considered as kinds of fruit.</P>

Harmless preparations of α-amylase obtained from <E T="03">Aspergillus oryzae,</E> alone or in a safe and suitable carrier, may be used. When tested for granulation as prescribed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, not less than 98 percent of the flour passes through a cloth having openings not larger than those of woven wire cloth designated “212 µm (No. 70)” complying with the specifications for such cloth set forth in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(a) Self-rising flour, self-rising white flour, self-rising wheat flour, is an intimate mixture of flour, sodium bicarbonate, and one or more of the acid-reacting substances monocalcium phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, and sodium aluminum phosphate. It is seasoned with salt. When it is tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section not less than 0.5 percent of carbon dioxide is evolved. The acid-reacting substance is added in sufficient quantity to neutralize the sodium bicarbonate. The combined weight of such acid-reacting substance and sodium bicarbonate is not more than 4.5 parts to each 100 parts of flour used. Subject to the conditions and restrictions prescribed by § 137.105(a), the bleaching ingredients specified in such section may be added as optional ingredients. If the flour used in making the self-rising flour is bleached, the optional bleaching ingredient used therein (see § 137.105(a)) is also an optional ingredient of the self-rising flour.</P>

              <P>(c) The method referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), section 8.002, “Reagent (Displacement soln.),” and section 8.003, “Chittick apparatus,” under the heading “Total Carbon Dioxide (1)—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference.

              <P>(1) Weigh 17 grams of the official sample into flask A, add 15-20 glass beads (4-6 mm. diameter), and connect this flask with the apparatus (fig. 22). Open stopcock C and by means of the leveling bulb E bring the displacement solution to the 25 cc. graduation above the zero mark. (This 25 cc. is a partial allowance for the volume of acid to be used in the decomposition.) Allow the apparatus to stand 1-2 minutes to insure that the temperature and pressure within the apparatus are the same as those of the room. Close the stopcock, lower the leveling bulb somewhat to reduce the pressure within the apparatus, and slowly run into the decomposition flask from burette F 45 cc. of sulfuric acid (1 + 5). To prevent the liberated carbon dioxide from escaping through the acid burette into the air, keep the displacement solution in the leveling bulb at all times during the decomposition at a lower level than that in the gas-measuring tube. Rotate and then vigorously agitate the decomposition flask for three minutes to mix the contents intimately. Allow to stand for 10 minutes to bring to equilibrium. Equalize the pressure in the measuring tube by means of the leveling bulb and read the volume of gas from the zero point on the tube. Deduct 20 cc. from this reading (this 20 cc. together with previous allowance of 25 cc. compensates for the 45 cc. acid used in the decomposition). Observe the temperature of the air surrounding the apparatus and also the barometric pressure and multiply the number of mL of gas evolved by the factor given in section 52.007, “Correction factors for gasometric determination of carbon dioxide,” AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (c) of this section), for the temperature and pressure observed. Divide the corrected reading by 100 to obtain the apparent percent by weight of carbon dioxide in the official sample.</P>

              <P>(2) Correct the apparent percent of carbon dioxide to compensate for varying atmospheric conditions by immediately assaying a synthetic sample by <PRTPAGE P="561"/>the same method in the same apparatus.</P>
              <P>(3) Prepare the synthetic sample with 16.2 grams of flour, 0.30 gram of monocalcium phosphate, 0.30 gram of salt, and a sufficient quantity of sodium bicarbonate U.S.P. (dried over sulfuric acid) to yield the amount of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample. Determine this quantity by multiplying weight of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample by 1.91.</P>
              <P>(4) Divide the weight of carbon dioxide recovered from synthetic sample by weight of carbon dioxide contained in sodium bicarbonate used.</P>
              <P>(5) Divide the quotient into the apparent percent of carbon dioxide in official sample to obtain percent of carbon dioxide evolved from the official sample.</P>

              <P>(2) The method referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is as follows: Use No. 12 and No. 25 sieves, having standard 20.3 centimeter (8-inch) diameter full-height frames, complying with the specifications for wire cloth and sieve frames in “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series)” prescribed in § 137.105(a), which is incorporated by reference.

It is referred to hereafter as the No. 72 sieve. The 72 XXX grits gauze has openings equivalent in size with those of No. 70 woven-wire cloth, complying with specifications for such cloth contained in such “Standard Specifications for Sieves.” Attach bottom pan to No. 72 sieve. Fit the No. 25 sieve into the No. 72 sieve and the No. 12 sieve into the No. 25 sieve. Pour 100 grams of sample into the No. 12 sieve, attach cover and hold the assembly in a slightly inclined position and shake the assembly of sieves by striking the sides against one hand with an upward stroke, at the rate of about 150 times per minute. Turn the assembly of sieves about one-sixth of a revolution, each time in the same direction, after each 25 strokes. Continue shaking for 2 minutes. Weigh separately the material remaining on each sieve and in the pan, and calculate each weight as percent of sample. Sometimes when meals are tested, fine particles clog the sieve openings. If any sieve is clogged by fine material smaller than its openings, empty the contents onto a piece of paper. Remove the entrapped material on the bottom of the sieve by a hair brush and add to the sieve below. In like manner, clean the adhering material from inside the sieve and add to the material on the paper. Return mixture on the paper to the sieve, reassemble the sieves, and shake in the same manner as before for 1 minute. Repeat cleaning procedure if necessary until a 5-gram or less loss in weight occurs in any sieve during a 1-minute shaking. The percent of sample passing through No. 12 sieve shall be determined by subtracting from 100 percent, the percent of material remaining on the No. 12 sieve. The percent passing through a No. 25 sieve shall be determined by adding the percents remaining on the No. 72 sieve and the percent in pan. The percent in the pan shall be considered as the percent passing through a No. 72 XXX grits gauze.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Self-rising white corn meal.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Self-rising white corn meal is an intimate mixture of white corn meal, sodium bicarbonate, and one or both of the acid-reacting substances monocalcium phosphate and sodium aluminum phosphate. It is seasoned with salt. When it is tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, not less than 0.5 percent of carbon dioxide is evolved. The acid-reacting substance is added in sufficient quantity to neutralize the sodium bicarbonate. The combined weight of such acid-reacting substance and sodium bicarbonate is not more than 4.5 parts to each 100 parts of white corn meal used.<PRTPAGE P="567"/>
              </P>

              <P>(b) The method referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), section 8.002, “Reagent (Displacement soln.),” and section 8.003, “Chittick apparatus,” under the heading “Total Carbon Dioxide (1)—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(1) Weigh 17 grams of the official sample into flask <E T="03">A,</E> add 15-20 glass beads (4-6 mm. diameter), and connect this flask with the apparatus (fig. 25). Open stopcock <E T="03">C</E> and by means of the leveling bulk <E T="03">E</E> bring the displacement solution to the 25 cc. graduation above the zero mark. (This 25 cc. is a partial allowance for the volume of acid to be used in the decomposition.) Allow the apparatus to stand 1-2 minutes to insure that the temperature and pressure within the apparatus are the same as those of the room. Close the stopcock, lower the leveling bulb somewhat to reduce the pressure within the apparatus, and slowly run into the decomposition flask from burette <E T="03">F</E> 45 cc. of sulfuric acid (1 + 5). To prevent the liberated carbon dioxide from escaping through the acid burette into the air keep the displacement solution in the leveling bulb at all times during the decomposition at a lower level than that in the gas-measuring tube. Rotate and then vigorously agitate the decomposition flask for 3 minutes to mix the contents intimately. Allow to stand for 10 minutes to bring to equilibrium. Equalize the pressure in the measuring tube by means of the leveling bulb and read the volume of gas from the zero point on the tube. Deduct 20 cc. from this reading (this 20 cc. together with previous allowance of 25 cc. compensates for the 45 cc. acid used in the decomposition). Observe the temperature of the air surrounding the apparatus and also the barometric pressure and multiply the number of mL of gas evolved by the factor given in the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), section 52.007 under Reference Tables for the temperature and pressure observed, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b) of this section. Divide the corrected reading by 100 to obtain the apparent percent by weight of carbon dioxide in the official sample.</P>
              <P>(2) Correct the apparent percent of carbon dioxide to compensate for varying atmospheric conditions by immediately assaying a synthetic sample by the same method in the same apparatus.</P>
              <P>(3) Prepare the synthetic sample with 16.2 grams of corn meal, 0.30 gram of monocalcium phosphate, 0.30 gram of salt, and a sufficient quantity of sodium bicarbonate U.S.P. (dried over sulfuric acid) to yield the amount of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample. Determine this quantity by multiplying weight of carbon dioxide recovered in assay of official sample by 1.91.</P>
              <P>(4) Divide the weight of carbon dioxide recovered from synthetic sample by weight of carbon dioxide contained in sodium bicarbonate used.</P>
              <P>(5) Divide the quotient into the apparent percent of carbon dioxide in official sample to obtain percent of carbon dioxide evolved from the official sample.</P>

Allow the rice to settle for <FR>1/2</FR> minute, then pour off 1,600 milliliters of the water, together with any floating and suspended matter, and discard. To the contents of the flask, add 1,600 milliliters of distilled water and 20 milliliters of 10 <E T="03">N</E> hydrochloric acid. Agitate vigorously and wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 <E T="03">N</E> hydrochloric acid. In order to avoid excess foaming during the extraction, heat the mixture slowly to about 100 °C, agitate if necessary, and maintain at this temperature until air is expelled. Again wash down the sides of the flask with 150 milliliters of 0.1 <E T="03">N</E> hydrochloric acid. Heat the mixture in an autoclave at 120 °C to 123 °C for 30 minutes, remove and cool to room temperature. Dilute the mixture with distilled water so that the total volume is 2,500 milliliters. Swirl the flask, and while the solids are in uniform suspension pour off about 250 milliliters of the mixture for later determination of iron (and calcium, if this is to be determined). With filter paper that has been shown not to adsorb thiamine, riboflavin, or niacin, filter enough of the remaining mixture for determination of thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. (In the case of a mixture difficult to filter, centrifuging or filtering through fritted glass, or both, using a suitable analytical filter-aid, may be substituted for, or may precede, filtering through paper.) Dilute an aliquot of filtrate with 0.1 <E T="03">N</E> hydrochloric acid, so that each milliliter contains about 0.2 microgram of thiamine, and determine thiamine by the “Rapid Fluorometric Method—Official Final Action,” in section 43.034 of “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed.

              <P>For the purposes of this part:</P>
              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">corn sirup</E> means a clarified, concentrated aqueous solution of the products obtained by the incomplete hydrolysis of cornstarch, and includes dried corn sirup. The solids of corn sirup and of dried corn sirup contain not less than 40 percent by weight of reducing sugars calculated as anhydrous dextrose.</P>
              <P>(b) The term <E T="03">dextrose</E> means the hydrated or anhydrous, refined monosaccharide obtained from hydrolyzed starch.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">dried glucose sirup</E> means the product obtained by drying “glucose sirup.”</P>
              <P>(d) The term <E T="03">glucose sirup</E> means a clarified, concentrated, aqueous solution of the products obtained by the incomplete hydrolysis of any edible starch. The solids of glucose sirup contain not less than 40 percent by weight of reducing sugars calculated as anhydrous dextrose.</P>
              <P>(e) The term <E T="03">invert sugar sirup</E> means an aqueous solution of inverted or partly inverted, refined or partly refined sucrose, the solids of which contain not more than 0.3 percent by weight of ash, and which is colorless, odorless, and flavorless, except for sweetness.</P>
              <P>(f) The term <E T="03">sugar</E> means refined sucrose.</P>
              <P>(g) The terms <E T="03">edible organic acid</E> and <E T="03">edible organic salt</E> refer to any edible organic acid and any edible organic salt added for the purpose of flavor enhancement that either is not a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or, if it is a food additive as so defined, is used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act.</P>
              <P>(h) The term <E T="03">water</E> means, in addition to water, any mixture of water and fruit juice in which the fruit juice(s) is less than 50 percent of such mixture, including any water contributed by the use of liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.</P>
              <P>(i) The term <E T="03">fruit juice(s) and water</E> means any mixture of fruit juice as herein defined and water, including any water contributed by the use of liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, in which the fruit juice(s) is 50 percent, or more, of such mixture except that water used in preparing equivalent single strength juice(s) from concentrate(s) shall not be considered to be a mixture of fruit juice and water.</P>
              <P>(j) The term <E T="03">fruit juice(s)</E> means single strength expressed juice(s) of sound, mature fruit(s). It may be fresh, frozen, canned, or made from concentrate(s). However, if it is made from concentrate(s), the juice(s) shall be reconstituted with water to not less than the soluble solids that such fruit juice had before concentration. Fruit juice(s) may be used singly or in combination. If a fruit juice(s) is used which is regulated by a standard of identity of this chapter, it shall conform to the compositional requirements prescribed by such standard prior to the addition of any sweetener which may be used.</P>
              <P>(k) The term <E T="03">clarified juice</E> means the liquid expressed wholly or in part from fruit peelings, fruit shells, fruit cores, or from the fruit flesh or parts thereof, which is clarified and may be further refined or concentrated.</P>
              <P>(l) The term <E T="03">solid pack</E> means the product contains practically all fruit with only the very little free flowing liquid that is expressed from the fruit <PRTPAGE P="583"/>and to which no packing media have been added.</P>

              <P>(m) The procedure for determining the densities of the packing media means the following: The density of the packing medium, when measured 15 days or more after packing, or the density of the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container, when measured less than 15 days after canning, is determined according to “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference, section 31.<SU>6</SU>F011 (Solids) “By Means of the Refractometer—Official Final Action” (and sections 52.012 and 52.015) with result expressed as percent by weight of sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C, but without correction for invert sugar or other substances. Copies of the material incorporated by reference may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(n) The procedure for determining drained weight is as follows: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth which complies with the specifications for the No. 8 sieve set forth in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” of the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (m) of this section. Carefully invert by hand all fruits having cups or cavities if they fall on the sieve with cups or cavities up. Cups or cavities in soft products may be drained by tilting sieve. Without further shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained fruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of the drained fruit.</P>
              <P>(o) Compliance means the following: Unless otherwise provided in a standard, a lot of canned fruits shall be deemed in compliance for the following factors, to be determined by the sampling and acceptance procedure as provided in paragraph (p) of this section, namely:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Packing medium density.</E> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for packing medium density based on the average sucrose value for all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans, but no container may have a sucrose value lower than that of the next lower category or 2 percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) lower if no lower category exists.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Quality.</E> The quality of a lot shall be considered acceptable when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number in the sampling plans.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for fill of container (packing medium and fruit ingredient) when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number (c) in the sampling plans.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Drained weight.</E> A lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for drained weight based on the average value of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans. The sample unit shall be the entire contents of the container.</P>
              <P>(p) The sampling and acceptance procedure means the following:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Definitions</E>—(i) <E T="03">Lot.</E> A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style manufactured or packed under similar conditions and handled as a single unit of trade.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> The number of primary containers or units in the lot.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Sample size.</E> The total number of sample units drawn for examination from a lot.<PRTPAGE P="584"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Sample unit.</E> A container, a portion of the contents of a container, or a composite mixture of product from small containers that is sufficient for the examination or testing as a single unit.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Defective.</E> Any sample unit shall be regarded as defective when the sample unit does not meet the criteria set forth in the standards.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Acceptance number</E> (<E T="03">c</E>). The maximum number of defective sample units permitted in the sample in order to consider the lot as meeting the specified requirements.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Acceptable quality level</E> (<E T="03">AQL</E>). The maximum percent of defective sample units permitted in a lot that will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Canned applesauce is the food prepared from comminuted or chopped apples (<E T="03">Malus domestica</E> Borkhausen), which may or may not be peeled and cored, and which may have added thereto one or more of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The apple ingredient is heated and, in accordance with good manufacturing practices, bruised apple particles, peel, seed, core material, carpel tissue, and other coarse, hard, or extraneous materials are removed. The food is sealed in containers. It is so processed by heat, either before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage. The soluble solids content, measured by refractometer and expressed as percent sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C (68 °F), is not less than 9 percent (exclusive of the solids of any added optional nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners) as determined by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed.

              </P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional ingredients.</E> The following safe and suitable optional ingredients may be used:</P>
              <P>(i) Water.</P>
              <P>(ii) Apple juice.</P>
              <P>(iii) Salt.</P>

              <P>(iv) Any organic acid added for the purpose of acidification. (Organic acids <PRTPAGE P="585"/>generally recognized as having a preservative effect are not permitted in applesauce except as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(viii) of this section.)</P>
              <P>(v) Nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.</P>
              <P>(vi) Spices.</P>
              <P>(vii) Natural and artificial flavoring.</P>
              <P>(viii) Either of the following:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Erythorbic acid or ascorbic acid as an antioxidant preservative in an amount not to exceed 150 parts per million; or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in a quantity such that the total vitamin C in each 113 g (4 ounces) by weight of the finished food amounts to 60 mg. This requirement will be deemed to have been met if a reasonable overage of the vitamin, within limits of good manufacturing practice, is present to insure that the required level is maintained throughout the expected shelf life of the food under customary conditions of distribution.</P>
              <P>(ix) Color additives in such quantity as to distinctly characterize the food unless such addition conceals damage or inferiority or makes the finished food appear better or of greater value than it is.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of the food is “applesauce”. The name of the food shall include a declaration indicating the presence of any flavoring that characterizes the product as specified in § 101.22 of this chapter and a declaration of any spice that characterizes the product. If a nutritive sweetener as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section is added and the soluble solids content of the finished food is not less than 16.5 percent as determined by the method referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the name may include the word “sweetened”. If no such sweetener is added, the name may include the word “unsweetened”.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter. However, when ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is added as provided for in paragraph (a)(2)(viii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section, after the application of heat to the apples, preservative labeling requirements do not apply.</P>
              <P>(b) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned applesauce is a fill of not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for fill of containers prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter; except that in the case of glass containers having a total capacity of 192 ml (6<FR>1/2</FR> fluid ounces) or less, the fill is not less than 85 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) Sampling and acceptance procedure: A lot will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the number of “defectives” exceeds the acceptance number “c” in the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(i) Definitions of terms to be used in the sampling plans in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are as follows:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">Lot.</E> A collection of primary containers or units of the same size, type, and style manufactured or packed under similar conditions and handled as a single unit of trade.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) <E T="03">Lot size.</E> The number of primary containers or units in the lot.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) <E T="03">Sample size “n.”</E> The total number of sample units drawn for examination from a lot as indicated in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">d</E>) <E T="03">Sample unit.</E> A container, the entire contents of a container, a portion of the contents of a container, or a composite mixture of product from small containers that is sufficient for examination or testing as a single unit.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">e</E>) <E T="03">Defective.</E> A container that falls below the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is considered a “defective.”</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">f</E>) <E T="03">Acceptable number “c.”</E> The maximum number of defective sample units permitted in the sample in order to consider the lot as meeting the specified requirements.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">g</E>) <E T="03">Acceptable quality level</E> (<E T="03">AQL</E>). The maximum percent of defective sample units permitted in a lot that will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for canned apricots is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) All units tested in accordance with the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are pierced by a weight of not more than 300 grams.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the cases of whole apricots, halves, and quarters, the weight of the largest unit in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest unit therein.</P>
              <P>(iii) Not more than 20 percent of the units in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormalities.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the cases of whole apricots, halves, and quarters, all units are untrimmed, or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape.</P>
              <P>(v) Except in the case of mixed pieces of irregular sizes and shapes, not more than 5 percent of the units in a container of 20 or more units, and not more than 1 unit in a container of less than 20 units, are crushed or broken. (A unit which has lost its normal shape because of ripeness and which bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered to be crushed or broken.)</P>
              <P>(2) Canned apricots shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 1<FR>1/8</FR> inches inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, <FR>3/4</FR> inch by 1 inch inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of <FR>3/4</FR> inch. Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with rectangular peel surface at least <FR>1/2</FR> inch by 1 inch cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod <FR>3/16</FR> inch in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by a support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams. Set the receptacle so that the surface of the test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less, except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random, in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.</P>
              <P>(3) If the quality of canned apricots falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; but in lieu of such general statement of substandard quality, the label may bear the alternative statement “Below standard in quality ___”, the blank to be filled in with the words specified after the corresponding number of each subparagraph of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which such canned apricots fail to meet, as follows:</P>

              <P>Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name “apricots” and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by § 145.115(a)(2).</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned apricots is the maximum quantity of the optional apricot ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.<PRTPAGE P="589"/>
              </P>
              <P>(2) If canned apricots fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for canned cherries is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) In the case of pitted cherries, not more than 1 pit is present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of each cherry in the container is not less than <FR>1/10</FR> ounce.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the case of unpitted cherries, the weight of the largest cherry in the container is not more than twice the weight of the smallest cherry therein.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the case of unpitted cherries, the total weight of pits is not more than 12 percent of the weight of drained cherries, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(v) Not more than 15 percent by count of the cherries in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue or other abnormality. A cherry showing skin discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area exceeding that of a circle <FR>9/32</FR> inch in diameter is considered to be blemished. A cherry showing discoloration of any area but extending into <PRTPAGE P="593"/>the fruit tissue is also considered to be blemished.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) Pitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: Take at random such number of containers as to have a total quantity of contents of at least 24 pounds. Open the containers and weigh the contents. Count the pits and pieces of pit shell in such total quantity. Count a piece of pit shell equal to or smaller than one-half pit shell as one-half pit, and a piece of pit shell larger than one-half pit shell as one pit; but when two or more pieces of pit shell are within or attached to a single cherry, count such pieces as one-half pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of one-half pit shell or less, and as one pit if their combined size is equivalent to that of more than one-half pit shell. From the total number of pits so counted and the combined weight of the contents of all the containers, calculate the number of pits present in each 20 ounces of canned cherries.</P>

              <P>(ii) Unpitted canned cherries shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 8 inches if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 3 pounds, or 12 inches if such quantity is 3 pounds or more. The bottom of the sieve is No. 8 woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth in the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD, 20877-2504, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained cherries. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of drained cherries. Pit the cherries and wash the pits free from adhering flesh. Drain and weigh the pits by the method prescribed above. Divide the weight of pits so found by the weight of drained cherries, and multiply by 100.</P>
              <P>(3) If the quality of canned cherries falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; but in lieu of such general statement of substandard quality, the label may bear the alternative statement “Below Standard in Quality ___”, the blank to be filled in with the words specified after the corresponding number of each subparagraph of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which such canned cherries fail to meet, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) “Partially pitted”;</P>
              <P>(ii) “Small”;</P>
              <P>(iii) “Mixed sizes”;</P>

Such drained weights shall be determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(v) There is present in the finished canned fruit cocktail not more than 1 square inch of peach peel per each 1 pound of drained weight of units of peach plus the weight of a proportion of the packing medium which is the same proportion as the drained weight of units of peach bears to the drained weight of the entire contents of the can. Such drained weights shall be determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) Not more than 15 percent of the units of cherry ingredient, and not more than 20 percent of the units of peach, pear, or grape, in the container are blemished with scab, hail injury, scar tissue or other abnormality.</P>
              <P>(vii) If the cherry ingredient is artificially colored, the color of not more than 15 percent of the units thereof in a container containing more than six units and of not more than one unit in a container containing six units or less, is other than evenly distributed in the unit or other than uniform with the color of the other units of the cherry ingredient.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned fruit cocktail is a fill such that the total weight of drained fruit is not less than 65 percent of the water capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for water capacity of containers prescribed in § 130.12(a) of this chapter. Such total weight of drained fruit is determined by the following method: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has been previously weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 8 inches if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 3 pounds, and 12 inches if such quantity is 3 pounds or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth under “2.38 mm (No. 8)” in Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Without shifting the material on the sieve so incline the sieve as to facilitate drainage. Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained fruit. The weight so found, less the <PRTPAGE P="600"/>weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the total weight of drained fruit.</P>
              <P>(2) If canned fruit cocktail falls below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein prescribed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Product identification.</E> Canned grapefruit is the food prepared from one of the optional grapefruit ingredients specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and one of the optional packing media specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Such food may also contain one or more of the following safe and suitable optional ingredients:</P>
              <P>(i) Spices.</P>
              <P>(ii) Natural and artificial flavoring.</P>
              <P>(iii) Lemon juice.<PRTPAGE P="602"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Citric acid.</P>

              <P>(v) Calcium chloride or calcium lactate or a mixture of the two calcium salts in a quantity reasonably necessary to firm the grapefruit sections, but in no case in a quantity such that the calcium contained in such calcium salt or mixture is more than 0.035 percent by weight of the finished food.
              </P>
              <FP>Such food is sealed in a container and, before or after sealing, is so processed by heat as to prevent spoilage.</FP>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Optional grapefruit ingredient.</E> The optional grapefruit ingredients referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are prepared from sound, mature grapefruit (<E T="03">Citrus paradisi</E> Macfadyen) of the color types white—produced from white-fleshed grapefruit, and pink—produced from pink or red-fleshed grapefruit and are in the following forms of units: Whole sections or broken sections. Each such form of units or a mixture of such forms of units prepared from a single varietal group (color type) is an optional grapefruit ingredient. The core, seeds, and major portions of membrane of such ingredient are removed. For the purpose of this section, a grapefruit section is considered whole when the unit is intact or an intact portion of such unit is not less than 75 percent of its apparent original size and is not excessively trimmed.</P>
              <P>(i) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the name of the optional grapefruit ingredient is:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) “Section” or “segments”, if 50 percent or more of the drained weight of the food consists of whole sections.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) “Broken sections” or “broken segments”, if less than 50 percent of the drained weight of the food consists of whole sections.</P>
              <P>(ii) The drained weight is determined by the method prescribed in the standard of fill of container for canned grapefruit set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Packing media.</E> (i) The optional packing media referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:</P>

              </P>
              <FP>As used in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the optional packing medium “water” means, in addition to water, any mixture of water and grapefruit juice in which there is less than 50 percent grapefruit juice; the optional packing medium “grapefruit juice and water” means the liquid packing medium in which juice of mature grapefruit and water are combined as a liquid packing medium with not less than 50 percent grapefruit juice and the term “grapefruit juice” means single strength expressed juice of sound, mature fruit. It may be fresh, canned, or made from concentrate. However, if it is made from concentrate, the juice shall be reconstituted with water to not less than the soluble solids the grapefruit juice had before concentration.</FP>

              <P>(ii) Each of the packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">d</E>) to (<E T="03">l</E>) of this section is prepared with a liquid ingredient and one or more safe and suitable nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. Water is the liquid ingredient from which packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">d</E>) to (<E T="03">f</E>) of this section are prepared. Grapefruit juice and water are the liquid ingredients from which the packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">g</E>) to (<E T="03">i</E>) of this section are prepared. Grapefruit juice is the liquid ingredient from which the packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">j</E>) to (<E T="03">l</E>) of this section are prepared. If one or more liquid nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners and grapefruit juice are combined as a liquid packing medium with not less than 50 percent grapefruit juice, the packing medium is as set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">g</E>) to (<E T="03">i</E>) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) The respective densities of packing media in paragraph (a)(3)(i) (<E T="03">d</E>) to (<E T="03">i</E>) of this section as measured on the <PRTPAGE P="603"/>refractometer, expressed as percent by weight sucrose (degrees Brix) with correction for temperature to the equivalent at 20 °C (68 °F), 15 days or more after the grapefruit are canned or the blended homogenized slurry of the comminuted entire contents of the container if canned for less than 15 days, according to the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists” (AOAC), 13th Ed. (1980), section 31.011 under “Solids By Means of Refractometer—Official Final Action,” and Reference Tables, section 52.012 (Refractive indices (n) of sucrose solutions at 20°) and section 52.015 (Refractive indices of invert sugar solutions), which is incorporated by reference (copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned grapefruit is:</P>
              <P>(i) The fill of grapefruit and packing medium, as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter, is not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container.</P>
              <P>(ii) The drained weight of grapefruit ingredient is not less than 50 percent of the water capacity of the container, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the general method for water capacity of containers prescribed in § 130.12(a) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(2) Drained weight is determined by the following method: Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is <PRTPAGE P="605"/>20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for the No. 8 sieve set forth in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” of the AOAC, 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section. Without shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve at an angle of 17° to 20° to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after the drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained grapefruit. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the weight of the drained grapefruit.</P>
              <P>(3)(i) A container that falls below the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall be considered a “defective”. The food will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the number of defectives exceeds the acceptance number (c) in the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Canned grapefruit will be deemed to fall below the standard of fill when the average drained weight of all containers analyzed when sampled according to the sampling plans prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is less than that prescribed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If canned grapefruit falls below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Uniformity of size</E>—(<E T="03">a</E>) <E T="03">Whole, halves, and quarters.</E> In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, the diameter (width) of the largest unit is not more than 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inch) greater than the diameter (width) of the smallest unit. In containers with more than 20 units, 2 units may be disregarded in making the determination. Where a unit has broken in the container, the combined broken pieces are to be reassembled to approximate a single unit of the appropriate style.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) <E T="03">Chunky.</E> In the case of chunky style, not more than 25 percent of the drained weight of the contents of the container consists of units that will pass through an opening 13 millimeters (0.5 inch) wide or that are more than 44 millimeters (1.75 inches) along the longest cut edge.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Peel.</E> Not more than 15 square centimeters aggregate area of peel per 1,000 grams (1.05 square inches per 16 ounces) of net weight. Include any peel adhering to the peach or loose in the container.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Blemished units.</E> Not more than 20 percent by count of the units in the container are blemished, e.g., with scab, hail injury, discoloration, or other abnormalities. Blemished units are units which contain surface discolorations that definitely contrast with the overall color and may penetrate into the flesh.</P>
              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Trimmed units.</E> In the case of whole, halves, quarters, and slices styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the units.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Crushed or broken units.</E> In the case of whole, halves, halves and pieces, quarters, slices, dice and chunky styles, not more than 5 percent <PRTPAGE P="608"/>by count of the units in containers of 20 or more units and not more than 1 unit in containers of fewer than 20 units are crushed or broken. A unit that has lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered crushed or broken.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Pits and pieces of pit.</E> In the case of all styles, except whole peaches and when whole peach pits or peach kernels are used as seasoning ingredients, there is not more than one loose pit or one loose large hard piece of pit (10 millimeters (<FR>3/8</FR> inch) or larger) or one unit of peach (e.g., peach half or peach slice) to which one or more large hard pieces of pit are attached per 5.67 kilograms (200 ounces) net weight. In addition, there is not more than three of any one or any combination of two or more, per 2.83 kilograms (100 ounces) net weight of the following: (<E T="03">a</E>) A unit to which one or more small hard pieces of pit less than 10 millimeters (<FR>3/8</FR> inch) but not less than 1.6 millimeters (<FR>1/16</FR> inch) are attached, (<E T="03">b</E>) a unit to which three or more small pieces of pit less than 1.6 millimeters (<FR>1/16</FR> inch) are attached, or (<E T="03">c</E>) a loose small hard piece of pit less than 10 millimeters (<FR>3/8</FR> inch).</P>
              <P>(2) Canned peaches shall be tested by the following method to determine whether or not they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 29 millimeters (1.125 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with a rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by a support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.53 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.45 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less, except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random, in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.</P>
              <P>(3) Determine compliance as specified in § 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel, pits, and pieces of pit based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in § 145.3(p).</P>

              <P>(4) If the quality of canned peaches falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality defined in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned peaches falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (viii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (“Good Food—Not High Grade”) a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned peaches fail to meet, as follows: (i) “Not tender”; (ii) “Small halves” or “Small quarters” as the case may be; (iii) (<E T="03">a</E>) “Mixed sizes”; (<E T="03">b</E>) “Undersized and/or oversized pieces”, (iv) “Excess peel”; (v) “Blemished”; <PRTPAGE P="609"/>(vi) “Unevenly trimmed”; (vii) “Partly crushed or broken”; (viii) “Contains pits or pit fragments”. Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name “peaches” and any words and statements required or authorized to appear with such name by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned peaches is the maximum quantity of the optional peach ingredient that can be sealed in the container and processed by heat to prevent spoilage, without crushing or breaking such ingredient.</P>
              <P>(2) If canned peaches fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

              <P>(vi) <E T="03">Trimmed units.</E> In the case of whole, halves, and quarters styles, all units are untrimmed or are so trimmed as to preserve normal shape of the unit.</P>
              <P>(vii) <E T="03">Crushed or broken units.</E> In the case of whole, halves, quarter, slices, dice, and chunky styles, not more than 10 percent by count of the units in containers of 10 or more units and not more than 1 unit in containers of less than 10 units are crushed or broken. A unit that lost its normal shape because of ripeness and bears no mark of crushing shall not be considered to be crushed or broken.</P>
              <P>(viii) <E T="03">Loose core material in all styles except uncored whole style.</E> Not more than two units of loose core material per kilogram (35.3 ounces) of net weight. A unit of such material is defined as a portion of loose core, with or <PRTPAGE P="612"/>without seeds, aggregating approximately one-half of a pear core.</P>

Seeds included as cored material in paragraph (b)(1) (viii) and (ix) of this section shall not be counted a second time.</P>
              <P>(2) Canned pears shall be tested by the following method to determine whether they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section: So trim a test piece from the unit as to fit, with peel surface up, into a supporting receptacle. If the unit is of different firmness in different parts of its peel surface, trim the piece from the firmest part. If the piece is unpeeled, remove the peel. The top of the receptacle is circular in shape, of 28.6 millimeters (1.12 inches) inside diameter, with vertical sides; or rectangular in shape, 19 millimeters (0.75 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) inside measurements, with ends vertical and sides sloping downward and joining at the center at a vertical depth of 19 millimeters (0.75 inch). Use the circular receptacle for testing units of such size that a test piece can be trimmed therefrom to fit it. Use the rectangular receptacle for testing other units. Test no unit from which a test piece with rectangular peel surface at least 13 millimeters (0.51 inch) by 25.4 millimeters (1 inch) cannot be trimmed. Test the piece by means of a round metal rod 4 millimeters (0.16 inch) in diameter. To the upper end of the rod is affixed a device to which weight can be added. The rod is held vertically by the support through which it can freely move upward or downward. The lower end of the rod is a plane surface to which the vertical axis of the rod is perpendicular. Adjust the combined weight of the rod and device to 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Set the receptacle so that the surface of the test piece is held horizontally. Lower the end of the rod to the approximate center of such surface, and add weight to the device at a uniform, continuous rate of 12 grams (0.42 ounce) per second until the rod pierces the test piece. Weigh the rod and weighted device. Test all units in containers of 50 units or less except those units too small for testing or too soft for trimming. Test at least 50 units, taken at random in containers of more than 50 units; but if less than 50 units are of sufficient size and firmness for testing, test those which are of sufficient size and firmness.</P>
              <P>(3) Determine compliance as specified in § 145.3(o) except that a lot shall be deemed to be in compliance for peel in all styles except unpeeled styles and seeds in all styles except whole uncored style based on the average of all samples analyzed according to the sampling plans set out in § 145.3(p).</P>
              <P>(4) If the quality of canned pears falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned pears falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1) (i) through (x) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality (“Good Food—Not High Grade”) a new line, as specified after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section which the canned pears fail to meet, as follows:</P>

              <P>(v) “Blemished”;</P>
              <P>(vi) “Unevenly trimmed”;</P>
              <P>(vii) “Partly crushed or broken”;</P>

              <P>(x) “Excessive seeds”.
              </P>

              <P>(ii) Identify and separate any core material cleanly from each of the units in the container, and weigh the aggregate of the core material. Calculate the percent core material to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iii) In the case of slices, half slices, quarter slices, spears, tidbits, chunks, and pieces, check the weight of the units against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (<E T="03">a</E>), (<E T="03">b</E>), (<E T="03">d</E>), (<E T="03">e</E>), (<E T="03">f</E>), and (<E T="03">h</E>) of this section.</P>

              <P>(iv) In the case of broken slices, check the dimensions of each unit against the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(<E T="03">c</E>) of this section.</P>

              <P>(v) In the case of cubes, and pieces, determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) (<E T="03">g</E>) and (<E T="03">h</E>) of this section by placing the units, a few at a time, on the mesh of a U.S. Standard No. 8 sieve (8-millimeter (0.31 inch)) mesh. After shaking gently, remove those units that remain on the sieve before testing the next portion. Continue portion-wise until all units are tested, then determine the aggregate weight of those units that have passed through the sieve.</P>

              <P>(vi) Except in the case of crushed pineapple, segregate and count each unit that is blemished as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. In the case of crushed pineapple, segregate each fragment of crushed pineapple bearing a blemish and determine the aggregate weight of such fragments to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vii) Except in the case of chunks, cubes, pieces, and crushed pineapple, inspect all the units in the container to determine those that have been excessively trimmed, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.</P>
              <P>(viii) Except in the case of cubes, pieces, and crushed pineapple, count the total units in the container and the number of mashed units to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) Determine the total acidity of the drained liquid by titration, using the following method: Measure with a pipette 10 milliliters of the unfiltered drained liquid into a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask. Add 25 milliliters of distilled or deionized water and 0.3 milliliter of 1-percent phenolphthalein solution. Titrate with one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide solution to a faint, permanently pink coloration. Multiply the number of milliliters of one-tenth normal sodium hydroxide required by 0.064 to calculate the number of grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100 milliliters of drained liquid to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section.</P>
              <P>(4) If the quality of canned pineapple falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form specified in that section; however, if the quality of the canned pineapple falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of the general statement of substandard quality (“Good Food—Not High Grade”) one of the following new lines, placed after the corresponding designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section that the canned pineapple fails to meet:</P>
              <P>(i) “Poorly cored” or “Excessive core”.</P>

              <P>(vi) “Excessively tart”.</P>
              <P>(vii) “Contains excess liquid”.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of Container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned crushed pineapple is a fill of not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container, as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) If canned crushed pineapple falls below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

After draining in accordance with the procedure set out in § 145.3(n) not more than 30 percent by weight of the drained plums consists of plums which have been blemished or damaged by any of the following factors either singly or in combination: Damaged by insects; appearance or eating quality materially affected by friction, disease, external stone gum or discoloration.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Crushed or broken units in whole and halves styles.</E> In the case of the whole styles, not more than 25 percent by weight of the drained plums are deformed or broken to an extent that the normal shape of the fruit is seriously affected. In the case of the halves style, not more than 25 percent by weight of the drained plums are damaged or torn to such an extent that they are smaller than 50 percent of a plum half.</P>
              <P>(iii) <E T="03">Blemishes and crushed or broken units.</E> Not more than 35 percent by weight of the drained plums consist of both blemishes as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and crushed or broken units in the case of the whole and halves styles as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(iv) <E T="03">Extraneous plant material.</E> Not more than one piece of stalk or stem from the plum tree or other harmless extraneous plant material per 200 grams (7 ounces) of drained plums.</P>
              <P>(v) <E T="03">Loose pits in whole style.</E> Not more than three loose pits per 500 grams (17.6 ounces) of drained plums.</P>

              <P>(iv) “Contains extraneous plant material”;</P>
              <P>(v) “Contains loose pits”; or</P>
              <P>(vi) “Contains pits” or “Contains pieces of pits”.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for canned plums is:</P>
              <P>(i) The fill of the plums and packing medium, as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter, is not less than 90 percent of the total capacity of the container.</P>
              <P>(ii) The drained weight of the plum ingredient as determined by the method prescribed in § 145.3(n) is not less than 50 percent for whole styles and 55 percent for halves styles based on the water capacity of containers as determined in § 130.12(a) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) Determine compliance for fill of container as specified in § 145.3(o).</P>
              <P>(3) If canned plums fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified. If canned plums fall below the standard of fill of container in respect to drained weight, the words “Low drained weight” shall follow the general statement of substandard fill on the label.</P>

The juice may be adjusted by the addition of the optional concentrated lemon juice ingredient <PRTPAGE P="624"/>specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section in such quantity so that the increase in acidity, calculated as anhydrous citric acid, does not exceed 15 percent of the acidity of the finished food. The lemon oil and lemon essence (derived from lemons) content may be adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The juice may have been concentrated and later reconstituted. When prepared from concentrated lemon juice, the finished food contains not less than 6 percent, by weight, of soluble solids taken as the refractometric sucrose value (of the filtrate), corrected to 20 °C, but uncorrected for acidity, in accordance with the “International Scale of Refractive Indices of Sucrose Solutions” in section 52.012 of “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed.

              <SUBJECT>Frozen concentrated orange juice.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Frozen concentrated orange juice is the food prepared by removing water from the juice of mature oranges as provided in § 146.135, to which may be added unfermented juice obtained from mature oranges of the species <E T="03">Citrus reticulata,</E> other <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> hybrids, or of <E T="03">Citrus aurantium,</E> or both. However, in the unconcentrated blend, the volume of juice from <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> or <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> hybrids shall not exceed 10 percent (except that this limitation shall not apply to the hybrid species described in § 146.135) and from <E T="03">Citrus aurantium</E> shall not exceed 5 percent. The concentrate so obtained is frozen. In its preparation, seeds (except embryonic seeds and small fragments of seeds that cannot be separated by good manufacturing practice) and excess pulp are removed, and a properly prepared water extract of the excess pulp so removed may be added. Orange oil, orange pulp, orange essence (obtained from orange juice), orange juice and other orange juice concentrate as provided in this section or concentrated orange juice for manufacturing provided in § 146.153 (when made from mature oranges), water, and one or more of the optional sweetening ingredients specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be added to adjust the final composition. The juice of <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> and <E T="03">Citrus aurantium,</E> as permitted by this paragraph, may be <PRTPAGE P="631"/>added in single strength or concentrated form prior to concentration of the <E T="03">Citrus sinensis</E> juice, or in concentrated form during adjustment of the composition of the finished food. The addition of concentrated juice from <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> or <E T="03">Citrus aurantium,</E> or both, shall not exceed, on a single-strength basis, the 10 percent maximum for <E T="03">Citrus reticulata</E> and the 5 percent maximum for <E T="03">Citrus aurantium</E> prescribed by this paragraph. Any of the ingredients of the finished concentrate may have been so treated by heat as to reduce substantially the enzymatic activity and the number of viable microorganisms. The finished food is of such concentration that when diluted according to label directions the diluted article will contain not less than 11.8 percent by weight of orange juice soluble solids, exclusive of the solids of any added optional sweetening ingredients. The dilution ratio shall be not less than 3 plus 1. For the purposes of this section and § 146.150, the term “dilution ratio” means the whole number of volumes of water per volume of frozen concentrate required to produce orange juice from concentrate having orange juice soluble solids of not less than 11.8 percent by weight exclusive of the solids of any added optional sweetening ingredients.</P>
              <P>(b) The optional sweetening ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are sugar, sugar sirup, invert sugar, invert sugar sirup, dextrose, corn sirup, dried corn sirup, glucose sirup, and dried glucose sirup.</P>
              <P>(c) If one or more of the sweetening ingredients specified in paragraph (b) of this section are added to the frozen concentrated orange juice, the label shall bear the statement “___ added”, the blank being filled in with the name or an appropriate combination of names of the sweetening ingredients used. However, for the purpose of this section, the name “sweetener” may be used in lieu of the specific name or names of the sweetening ingredients.</P>
              <P>(d) The name of the food concentrated to a dilution ratio of 3 plus 1 is “frozen concentrated orange juice” or “frozen orange juice concentrate”. The name of the food concentrated to a dilution ratio greater than 3 plus 1 is “frozen concentrated orange juice, ___ plus 1” or “frozen orange juice concentrate, ___ plus 1”, the blank being filled in with the whole number showing the dilution ratio; for example, “frozen orange juice concentrate, 4 plus 1”. However, where the label bears directions for making 1 quart of orange juice from concentrate (or multiples of a quart), the blank in the name may be filled in with a mixed number; for example, “frozen orange juice concentrate, 4<FR>1/3</FR> plus 1”. For containers larger than 1 pint, the dilution ratio in the name may be replaced by the concentration of orange juice soluble solids in degrees Brix; for example, a 62° Brix concentrate in 3<FR>1/2</FR>-gallon cans may be named on the label “frozen concentrated orange juice, 62° Brix”.</P>
              <P>(e) Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the statements specified in this section for naming the optional ingredients used shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow the name of the food, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter.</P>
              <P>(f) Nothing in this section is intended to interfere with the adoption and enforcement by any State, in regulating the production of frozen concentrated orange juice in such State, of State standards, consistent with this section, but which impose higher or more restrictive requirements than those set forth in this section.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Pineapple juice.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity.</E> (1) Pineapple juice is the juice, intended for direct consumption, obtained by mechanical process from the flesh or parts thereof, with or without core material, of sound, ripe pineapple (<E T="03">Ananas comosus</E> L. Merrill). The juice may have been concentrated and later reconstituted with water suitable for the purpose of maintaining essential composition and quality factors of the juice. Pineapple juice may contain finely divided insoluble solids, but it does not contain pieces of shell, seeds, or other coarse or hard substances or excess pulp. It may be sweetened with any safe and suitable dry nutritive carbohydrate sweetener. However, if the pineapple juice is prepared from concentrate, such sweeteners, in liquid <PRTPAGE P="634"/>form, also may be used. It may contain added vitamin C in a quantity such that the total vitamin C in each 4 fluid ounces of the finished food amounts to not less than 30 milligrams and not more than 60 milligrams. In the processing of pineapple juice, di­methyl­poly­sil­oxane complying with the requirements of § 173.340 of this chapter may be employed as a defoaming agent in an amount not greater than 10 parts per million by weight of the finished food. Such food is prepared by heat sterilization, refrigeration, or freezing. When sealed in a container to be held at ambient temperatures, it is so processed by heat, before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage.</P>
              <P>(2) The name of the food is “Pineapple juice” if the juice from which it is prepared has not been concentrated and/or diluted with water. The name of the food is “Pineapple juice from concentrate” if the finished juice has been made from pineapple juice concentrate as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. If a nutritive sweetener is added, the label shall bear the statement “Sweetener added.” If no sweetener is added, the word “Unsweetened” may immediately precede or follow the words “Pineapple juice” or “Pineapple juice from concentrate.”</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for pineapple juice is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The soluble solids content of pineapple juice (exclusive of added sugars) without added water shall not be less than 10.5° Brix as determined by refractometer at 20 °C uncorrected for acidity and read as degrees Brix on International Sucrose Scales. Where the juice has been obtained using concentrated juice with addition of water, the soluble pineapple juice solids content (exclusive of added sugars) shall be not less than 12.8° Brix, uncorrected for acidity and read as degrees Brix on the International Sucrose Scales.</P>
              <P>(ii) The acidity, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, is not more than 1.35 grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100 milliliters of the juice.</P>
              <P>(iii) The ratio of the degrees Brix to total acidity, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, is not less than 12.</P>
              <P>(iv) The quantity of finely divided “insoluble solids”, as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, is not less than 5 percent nor more than 30 percent.</P>
              <P>(2) The methods referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Determine the degrees Brix of the pineapple juice by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), section 31.009, “Solids by Means of Spindle—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(ii) Determine the total acidity of the pineapple juice by titration by the method prescribed in § 145.180(b)(2)(ix) of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(iii) Divide the degrees Brix determined as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section by the grams of anhydrous citric acid per 100 milliliters of juice, determined as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and report the results as ratio of degrees Brix to total acidity.</P>

              <P>(iv) Determine the quantity of “insoluble solids” in pineapple juice as follows: Measure 50 milliliters of thoroughly stirred pineapple juice into a cone-shaped graduated tube of the long-cone type, measuring approximately 4<FR>3/16</FR> inches from tip to top calibration and having a capacity of 50 milliliters. Place the tube in a suitable centrifuge the approximate speed of which is related to diameter of swing in accordance with the table immediately below. The word “diameter” means the over-all distance between <PRTPAGE P="635"/>the tips of opposing centrifuge tubes in operating position.</P>

              <P>(1) One or any combination of two or more of the following acidifying ingredients:</P>
              <P>(i) Lemon juice.</P>
              <P>(ii) Lime juice.</P>
              <P>(iii) Citric acid.</P>
              <P>(2) Honey, in a quantity not less than 2 percent and not more than 3 percent by weight of the finished food.</P>
              <P>(3) Vitamin C, in a quantity such that the total vitamin C in each 6 fluid ounces of the finished food amounts to not less than 30 milligrams and not more than 50 milligrams.</P>
              <P>(c)(1) The name of the food is “Prune juice—a water extract of dried prunes”. For the purposes of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act concerning the label declaration of the name of the food, the explanatory statement “A water extract of dried prunes” may appear immediately below the words “prune juice”, but there shall be no intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, and the type used for the words “A water extract of dried prunes” shall be of the same style and not less than half the print size of the type used for the words “prune juice”.</P>
              <P>(2)(i) When one or more of the acidifying ingredients specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are used, the label shall bear the statement “___ added” or “with added ___”, the blank being filled in with the name or names of the optional ingredients used.</P>

              <P>(ii) When honey, as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is used the <PRTPAGE P="636"/>label shall bear the statement “with ___ honey” or “___ honey added”, the blank to be filled in with the percent by weight of the honey in the finished food or with the statement “between 2 and 3%”.</P>
              <P>(iii) When one or more of the ingredients designated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the ingredient designated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are used, the statements specified in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section may be combined, as for example, “with lemon juice and between 2 and 3% honey added”.</P>
              <P>(iv) When vitamin C is added as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it shall be designated on the label as “vitamin C added” or “with added vitamin C”.</P>
              <P>(3) Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words specified in this paragraph, showing the optional ingredients used, shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter.</P>
              <P>(d) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(d) For the purposes of this section:</P>
              <P>(1) The mixture referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be composed of not less than: (i) In the case of a fruit ingredient consisting of a Group I fruit or a permitted combination exclusively of Group I fruits, 47 parts by weight of the fruit ingredient to each 55 parts by weight of the saccharine ingredient; and (ii) in all other cases, 45 parts by weight of the fruit ingredient to each 55 parts by weight of the saccharine ingredient. The weight of the fruit ingredient shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the weight of the saccharine ingredient shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) Any requirement with respect to the weight of any fruit, combination of fruits, or fruit ingredient means:</P>
              <P>(i) The weight of fruit exclusive of the weight of any sugar, water, or other substance added for any processing or packing or canning, or otherwise added to such fruit.</P>
              <P>(ii) In the case of fruit prepared by the removal, in whole or in part, of pits, seeds, skins, cores, or other parts; the weight of such fruit, exclusive of the weight of all such substances removed therefrom.</P>
              <P>(iii) In the cases of apricots, cherries, grapes, nectarines, peaches, and all varieties of plums, whether or not pits and seeds are removed therefrom; the weight of such fruit, exclusive of the weight of such pits and seeds.</P>
              <P>(iv) In the case of concentrated fruit, the weight of the properly prepared fresh fruit used to produce such concentrated fruit.</P>
              <P>(3) The term <E T="03">concentrated fruit</E> means a concentrate made from the properly prepared edible portion of mature fresh or frozen fruits by removal of moisture <PRTPAGE P="641"/>with or without the use of heat or vacuum, but not to the point of drying. Such concentrate is canned or frozen without the addition of sugar or other sweetening agents and is identified to show or permit the calculation of the weight of the properly prepared fresh fruit used to produce any given quantity of such concentrate. The volatile flavoring material or essence from such fruits may be captured during concentration and separately concentrated for subsequent addition to the concentrated fruit either directly or during manufacture of the preserve or jam, in the original proportions present in the fruit.</P>
              <P>(4) The weight of any optional saccharine ingredient means the weight of the solids of such ingredient.</P>

              <P>(5) The soluble-solids content of the finished jam or preserve is not less than 65 percent, as determined by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), section 22.024, under “Soluble Solids by Refractometer in Fresh and Canned Fruits, Jellies, Marmalades, and Preserves—Official Final Action,” which is incorporated by reference, except that no correction is made for water-insoluble solids.

              <SUBJECT>Frozen cherry pie.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity.</E> (1) Frozen cherry pie (excluding baked and then frozen) is the food prepared by incorporating in a filling contained in a pastry shell mature, pitted, stemmed cherries that are fresh, frozen, and/or canned. The top of the pie may be open or it may be wholly or partly covered with pastry or other suitable topping. Filling, pastry, and topping components of the food consist of optional ingredients as prescribed by paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The finished food is frozen.</P>

              <P>(2) The optional ingredients referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section consist of suitable substances that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and <PRTPAGE P="642"/>Cosmetic Act or color additives as defined in section 201(t) of the act; or if they are food additives or color additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 or 721 of the act. Ingredients that perform a useful function in the formulation of the filling, pastry, and topping components, when used in amounts reasonably required to accomplish their intended effect, are regarded as suitable except that artificial sweeteners are not suitable ingredients of frozen cherry pie.</P>
              <P>(3) The name of the food for which a definition and standard of identity is established by this section is frozen cherry pie; however, if the maximum diameter of the food (measured across opposite outside edges of the pastry shell) is not more than 4 inches, the food alternatively may be designated by the name frozen cherry tart. The word “frozen” may be omitted from the name on the label if such omission is not misleading.</P>
              <P>(4)(i) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(ii) The label shall not bear any misleading pictorial representation of the cherries in the pie.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for frozen cherry pie is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The fruit content of the pie is such that the weight of the washed and drained cherry content is not less than 25 percent of the weight of the pie when determined by the procedure prescribed by paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ii) Not more than 15 percent by count of the cherries in the pie are blemished with scab, hail injury, discoloration, scar tissue, or other abnormality. A cherry showing skin discoloration (other than scald) having an aggregate area exceeding that of a circle nine thirty-seconds of an inch in diameter is considered to be blemished. A cherry showing discoloration of any area but extending into the fruit tissue is also considered to be blemished.</P>
              <P>(2) Compliance with the requirement for the weight of the washed and drained cherry content of the pie, as prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, is determined by the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(i) Select a random sample from a lot:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) At least 24 containers if they bear a weight declaration of 16 ounces or less.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Enough containers to provide a total quantity of declared weight of at least 24 pounds if they bear a weight declaration of more than 16 ounces.</P>
              <P>(ii) Determine net weight of each frozen pie.</P>
              <P>(iii) Temper the pie until the top crust can be removed.</P>
              <P>(iv) Remove the filling and cherries from the pie and transfer to the surface of a previously weighed 12-inch diameter U.S. No. 8 sieve (0.094-inch openings) stacked on a U.S. No. 20 sieve (0.033-inch openings).</P>
              <P>(v) Distribute evenly over the surface and wash with a gentle spray of water at 70°-75 °F to free the cherries and cherry fragments from the adhering material.</P>
              <P>(vi) Remove the U.S. No. 8 sieve and examine the U.S. No. 20 sieve and transfer all cherry fragments to the U.S. No. 8 sieve.</P>
              <P>(vii) Drain the cherry contents on the No. 8 sieve for 2 minutes in an inclined position (15°-30° slope). Weigh the U.S. No. 8 sieve and the washed and drained cherries to the nearest 0.01 ounce.</P>

              <P>(viii) The weight of the washed and drained cherries is the weight of the sieve and the cherry material less the weight of the sieve. Calculate the percent of the cherry content of each pie with the following formula, and then calculate the average percent of the entire random sample:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">Percent of the cherry content of the pie = [(Weight of washed and drained cherries) / (Net weight of pie)] × 100.</FP>
              </EXTRACT>
              

              <P>(3) If the quality of the frozen cherry pie falls below the standard of quality prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form specified therein; but in lieu of the words prescribed for the second line inside the rectangle, the label may bear the alternative statement “Below standard in quality ______”, the blank being filled in with the following words, as applicable: <PRTPAGE P="643"/>“too few cherries”, or “blemished cherries”. Such alternative statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow, without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, the name of the food as prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

              <P>(i) In the case of cut beans and diagonal cut beans under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) (<E T="03">c</E>) and (<E T="03">d</E>) of this section and mixtures of two or more optional forms under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(<E T="03">g</E>) of this section, not more than 60 units per 340 g (12 oz) drained weight are less than 13 mm (0.50 in) long: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That where the number of units per 340 g (12 oz) drained weight exceeds 240, not more than 25 percent by count of the total units are less than 13 mm (0.50 in) long.</P>
              <P>(ii) In case there are present pods or pieces of pods 10.7 mm (<FR>27/64</FR>-inch) or more in diameter, there are not more than 12 strings per 340 gm (12 ounces) of drained weight which will support 227 gm (one-half pound) for 5 seconds or longer.</P>

              <P>(iv) There are not more than 10 percent by weight of blemished units of which amount not more than one-half may be materially damaged by insect or pathological injury. A unit is considered blemished when the aggregate blemished area exceeds the area of a circle 3 mm (<FR>1/8</FR> in) in diameter. Materially damaged means that the unit is damaged to the extent that the appearance or eating quality of the unit is seriously affected.</P>
              <P>(v) There are not more than 8 unstemmed units per 340 g (12 oz) drained weight.</P>
              <P>(vi) The combined number of leaves, detached stems, and other extraneous vegetable matter shall not average more than 3 pieces per 340 g (12 oz) drained beans.</P>
              <P>(2) Canned beans shall be tested by the following method to determine whether they meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:</P>

              <P>(i) Determine the gross weight of the container. Open and distribute the contents of the container over the meshes of a U.S. No. 8 circular sieve with openings of 2.36 mm (0.0937 in), which has been previously weighed. The diameter <PRTPAGE P="647"/>of the sieve is 20.3 cm (8 in) if the quantity of contents of the container is less than 1.36 kg (3 lb) and 30.5 cm (12 in) if such quantity is 1.36 kg (3 lb) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications of such cloth set forth in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 15th ed. (1990), vol. 2, p. xii, Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (USA Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E> Without shifting the material on the sieve, incline the sieve 17 to 20° to facilitate drainage. Two minutes after drainage begins, weigh the sieve and the drained material. Record in grams (ounces) the weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, as the drained weight. Dry and weigh the empty container and subtract this weight from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. Calculate the percent of drained liquid in the net weight.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pour the drained material from the sieve into a flat tray and spread it in a layer of fairly uniform thickness. Count the total number of units. For the purpose of this count, loose seeds, pieces of seed, loose stems, and extraneous material are not to be included. Divide the number of units by the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and multiply by 340 to obtain the number of units per 340 g (12 oz) drained weight.</P>

              <P>(iii) Examine the drained material in the tray, weigh and record weight of blemished units, count and record the number of unstemmed units; and, in case the material consists of the optional ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) (<E T="03">c</E>), (<E T="03">d</E>) or (<E T="03">f</E>) of this section, count and record the number of units which are less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) long. If the number of units per 340 g (12 oz.) is 240 or less, divide the number of units which are less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) by the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and multiply by 340 to obtain the number of such units per 340 g (12 oz.) drained weight. If the number of units per 340 g (12 oz.) exceeds 240, divide the number of units less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) long by the total number of units and multiply by 100 to determine the percentage by count of the total units which are less than 13 mm (0.50 in.) long.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Divide the weight of blemished units by the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage by weight of blemished units in the container.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Divide the number of unstemmed units by the drained weight recorded in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and multiply by 340 to obtain the number of unstemmed units per 340 g (12 oz.) of drained weight.</P>
              <P>(iv) Remove from the tray the extraneous vegetable material, count, record count, and return to tray.</P>
              <P>(v) Remove from the tray one or more representative samples of 99 to 113 g (3<FR>1/2</FR> to 4 ounces) covering each sample as taken to prevent evaporation.</P>

              <P>(vi) From each representative sample selected in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, discard any loose seed and extraneous vegetable material and detach and discard any attached stems. Except with optional style of ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(<E T="03">b</E>) of this section (pods sliced lengthwise), trim off, as far as the end of the space formerly occupied by the seed, any portion of pods from which the seed has become separated. Remove and discard any portions of seed from the trimmings and reserve the trimmings for paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section. Weigh and record the weight of the trimmed pods. Deseed the trimmed pods and reserve the deseeded pods for paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section. Remove strings from the pods during the deseeding operation. Reserve these strings for testing as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section. In <PRTPAGE P="648"/>the case of pods sliced lengthwise, remove seed and pieces of seed and reserve the deseeded pods for use as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of this section.</P>

              <P>(vii) If strings have been removed for testing, as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, test them as follows:
              </P>
              <EXTRACT>
                <P>Fasten clamp, weighted to 250 g (8.8 oz.), to one end of the string, grasp the other end with the fingers (a cloth may be used to aid in holding the string), and lift gently. Count the string as tough if it supports the 250 g (8.8 oz.) weight for at least 5 seconds. If the string breaks before 5 seconds, test such parts into which it breaks as are 13 mm (<FR>1/2</FR> in.) or more in length; and if any such part of the string supports the 250 g (8.8 oz.) weight for at least 5 seconds, count the string as tough.

(12 inches), except that when the washed drained material contains more than 20 percent of alcohol-insoluble solids, the average diameter of the approximately circular area over which the prescribed sample spreads does not exceed 25.4 cm. (10 inches).</P>
              <P>(iii)(<E T="03">a</E>) The weight of the alcohol-insoluble solids of whole-kernel corn (paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) does not exceed 27 percent of the drained weight, when tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) The weight of the alcohol-insoluble solids of the washed drained material of cream style corn (paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) does not exceed 27 percent of the drained weight of such material, when tested by the method prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The method referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for testing whole-kernel corn (paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) is as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Determine the gross weight of the container. Open and distribute the contents of the container over the meshes of a U.S. No. 8 circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 cm. (8 inches) if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 1.36 kg. (3 pounds), and 30.5 cm. (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.36 kg. (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such sieve set forth in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official <PRTPAGE P="651"/>Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E> Without shifting the material on the sieve, so incline the sieve at approximately 17-20° angle to facilitate drainage. Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and the drained material. Record, in g. (ounces), the weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, as the drained weight. Dry and weigh the empty container and subtract this weight from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. Calculate the percent of drained liquid in the net weight.</P>
              <P>(ii) Pour the drained material from the sieve into a flat tray and spread it in a layer of fairly uniform thickness. Count, but do not remove, the brown or black discolored kernels or pieces of kernel and calculate the number per 400 g. (14 ounces) of drained material. Remove pieces of silk more than 12.7 mm. (one-half inch) long, husk, cob, and any pieces of material other than corn. Measure the aggregate length of such pieces of silk and calculate the length of silk per 28 g. (1 ounce) of drained weight. Spread the husk flat, measure its aggregate area, and calculate the area of husk per 400 g. (14 ounces) of drained weight. Place all pieces of cob under a measured amount of water in a cylinder which is so graduated that the volume can be measured to 0.1 cubic centimeter. Take the increase in volume as the aggregate volume of the cob and calculate the volume of cob per 400 g. (14 ounces) of drained weight.</P>
              <P>(iii) Comminute representative 100 g. sample of the drained corn from which the silk, husk, cob, and other material which is not corn (i.e., peppers) have been removed. An equal amount of water is used to facilitate this operation. Weigh to nearest 0.01 g. a portion of the comminuted material equivalent to approximately 10 g. of the drained corn into a 600 cubic centimeter beaker. Add 300 cubic centimeters of 80 percent alcohol (by volume), stir, cover beaker, and bring to a boil. Simmer slowly for 30 minutes. Fit a Buchner funnel with a previously prepared filter paper of such sizes that its edges extend 12.7 mm. (one-half inch) or more up the vertical sides of the funnel. The previous preparation of the filter paper consists of drying it in a flat-bottomed dish for 2 hours at 100 °C, covering the dish with a tight fitting cover, cooling it in a desiccator, and promptly weighing to the nearest 0.001 g. After the filter paper is fitted to the funnel, apply suction and transfer the contents of the beaker to the funnel. Do not allow any of the material to run over the edge of the paper. Wash the material on the filter with 80 percent alcohol (by volume) until the washings are clear and colorless. Transfer the filter paper with the material retained thereon to the dish used in preparing the filter paper. Dry the material in a ventilated oven, without covering the dish, for 2 hours at 100 °C. Place the cover on the dish, cool it in a desiccator, and promptly weigh to the nearest 0.001 g. From this weight subtract the weight of the dish, cover, and paper as previously found. Calculate the remainder to percentage.</P>
              <P>(3) The method referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for testing cream-style corn (paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section) is as follows:</P>

              <P>(i) Allow the container to stand at least 24 hours at a temperature of 68 °F to 85 °F. Determine the gross weight, open, transfer the contents into a pan, and mix thoroughly in such a manner as not to incorporate air bubbles. (If the net contents of a single container is less than 510 g. (18 ounces) determine the gross weight, open, and mix the contents of the least number of containers necessary to obtain 510 g. (18 ounces). Fill level full a hollow, truncated cone so placed on a polished horizontal plate as to prevent leakage. The cone has an inside bottom diameter of 7.62 cm. (3 inches), inside top diameter of 5.08 cm. (2 inches), and height of <PRTPAGE P="652"/>12.30 cm. (4<FR>27/32</FR> inches). As soon as the cone is filled, lift it vertically. Determine the average of the longest and shortest diameters of the approximately circular area on the plate covered by the sample 30 seconds after lifting the cone. Dry and weigh each empty container and subtract the weight so found from the gross weight to obtain the net weight.</P>
              <P>(ii) Transfer the material from the plate, cone, and pan onto a U.S. No. 8 sieve as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 cm. (8 inches) if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 1.36 kg. (3 pounds), and 30.5 cm. (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.36 kg. (3 pounds) or more. Set the sieve in a pan. Add enough water to bring the level within 9.53 mm. (three-eighth inch) to 6.35 mm. (one-fourth inch) of the top of the sieve. Gently wash the material on the sieve by combined up-and-down and circular motion for 30 seconds. Repeat washing with a second portion of water. Remove sieve from pan, incline to facilitate drainage, and drain for 2 minutes.</P>
              <P>(iii) From the material remaining on the U.S. No. 8 sieve, count, but do not remove, the brown or black discolored kernels or pieces of kernel and calculate the number per 600 g. (21.4 ounces) of net weight. Remove pieces of silk more than 12.7 mm. (one-half inch) long, husk, cob, and other material which is not corn (i.e., peppers). Measure aggregate length of such pieces of silk and calculate the length per 28 g. (ounce) of net weight. Spread the husk flat and measure its aggregate area and calculate the area per 600 g. (21.4 ounces) of net weight. Place all pieces of cob under a measured amount of water in a cylinder which is so graduated that the volume may be measured to 0.1 cubic centimeter. Take the increase in volume as the aggregate volume of the cob and calculate the volume of cob per 600 g. (21.4 ounces) of net weight. Take a representative 100 g. sample of the material remaining on the U.S. No. 8 sieve (if such material weighs less than 100 g. take all of it) and determine the alcohol-insoluble solids as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section for whole kernel corn.</P>
              <P>(4) Determine compliance as specified in § 155.3(b).</P>

              <P>(5) If the quality of canned corn falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified; however, if the quality of the canned corn falls below standard with respect to only one of the factors of quality specified by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) to (<E T="03">d</E>) of this section, or by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (<E T="03">a</E>) to (<E T="03">e</E>) of this section, there may be substituted for the second line of such general statement of substandard quality, “Good food—not high grade”, a new line as specified after the corresponding subdivision designation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which the canned corn fails to meet:

              <P>(i) Remove lid from container, but in the case of a container with lid attached by double seam, do not remove or alter the height of the double seam. Tilt the opened container so as to distribute the contents over the meshes of a circular sieve which has previously been weighed. The diameter of the sieve used is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or 30.5 centimeters (12 inches) if such quantity is 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The meshes of such sieve are made by so weaving wire of 1.4 mm (0.054 inch) diameter as to form square openings 11.3 mm by 11.3 mm (0.446 inch by 0.446 inch). Without shifting the tomatoes, so incline the sieve as to facilitate drainage of the liquid. Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and drained tomatoes. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the drained weight.</P>
              <P>(ii) Remove from the sieve the drained tomatoes, cut out and segregate successively those portions of least redness until 50 percent of the drained weight has been so segregated. Comminute the segregated portions to a uniform mixture without removing or breaking the seeds. Fill the mixture into a black container to a depth of at least 25.4 mm (1 inch). Free the mixture from air bubbles, and skim off or press below the surface all visible seeds. Compare the color of the mixture, in full diffused daylight or its equivalent, with the blended color of combinations of the following concentric Munsell color discs of equal diameter, or the color equivalent of such discs:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Red—Munsell 5 R 2.6/13 (glossy finish).</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Tomato concentrates are the class of foods each of which is prepared by concentrating one or any combination of two or more of the following optional tomato ingredients:</P>

              <P>(i) The liquid obtained from mature tomatoes of the red or reddish varieties (<E T="03">Lycopersicum esculentum</E> P. Mill).</P>
              <P>(ii) The liquid obtained from the residue from preparing such tomatoes for canning, consisting of peelings and cores with or without such tomatoes or pieces thereof.</P>

              <P>(iii) The liquid obtained from the residue from partial extraction of juice from such tomatoes.
              </P>
              <FP>Such liquid is obtained by so straining the tomatoes, with or without heating, as to exclude skins (peel), seeds, and other coarse or hard substances in accordance with good manufacturing practice. Prior to straining, food-grade hydrochloric acid may be added to the tomato material in an amount to obtain a pH no lower than 2.0.

              </P>
              <FP>Such liquid is strained so as to exclude skins, seeds, and other coarse or hard substances in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. Prior to straining, food-grade hydrochloric acid may be added to the tomato material in an amount to obtain a pH no lower than 2.0. Such acid is then neutralized with food-grade sodium hydroxide so that the treated tomato material is restored to a pH of 4.2±0.2. The final composition of the food may be adjusted by concentration and/or by the addition of water. The food may contain salt (sodium chloride formed during acid neutralization shall be considered added salt) and is seasoned with ingredients as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The food is preserved by heat sterilization (canning), refrigeration, or freezing. When sealed in a container to be held at ambient temperatures, it is so processed by heat, before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage.</FP>

              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for catsup is as follows: The consistency of the finished food is such that its flow is not more than 14 centimeters in 30 seconds at 20 °C when tested in a Bostwick Consistometer in the following manner: Check temperature of mixture and adjust to 20±1 °C. The trough must also be at a temperature close to 20 °C. Adjust end-to-end level of Bostwick Consistometer by means of the spirit level placed in trough of instrument. Side-to-side level may be adjusted by means of the built-in spirit level. Transfer sample to the dry sample chamber of the Bostwick Consistometer. Fill the chamber slightly more than level full, avoiding air bubbles as far as possible. Pass a straight edge across top of chamber starting from the gate end to remove excess product. Release gate of instrument by gradual pressure on lever, holding the instrument down at the same time to prevent its movement as the gate is released. Immediately start the stop watch or interval timer, and after 30 seconds read the maximum distance of flow to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. Clean and dry the instrument and repeat the reading on another portion of sample. Do not wash instrument with hot water if it is to be used immediately for the next determination, as this may result in an increase in temperature of the sample. For highest accuracy, the instrument should be maintained at a temperature of 20±1 °C. If readings vary more than 0.2 centimeter, repeat a third time or until satisfactory agreement is obtained. Report the average of two or more readings, excluding any that appear to be abnormal.</P>

              <FP>Such comparison is to be made in full diffused daylight or under a diffused light source of approximately 2691 lux (250 footcandles) and having a spectral quality approximating that of daylight under a moderately overcast sky, with a correlated color temperature of 7,500 degrees Kelvin ±200 degrees. With the light source directly over the disc and product, observation is made at an angle of 45 degrees from a distance of <PRTPAGE P="666"/>about 24 inches from the product. Electronic color meters may be used as an alternate means of determining the color of tomato juice. Such meters shall be calibrated to indicate that the color of the product is as red or more red than that produced by spinning the Munsell color discs in the combination as set out above.</FP>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Definition.</E> Tomato juice is the food intended for direct consumption, obtained from the unfermented liquid extracted from mature tomatoes of the red or reddish varieties of <E T="03">Lycopersicum esculentum</E> P. Mill, with or without scalding followed by draining. In the extraction of such liquid, heat may be applied by any method which does not add water thereto. Such juice is strained free from peel, seeds, and other coarse or hard substances, but contains finely divided insoluble solids from the flesh of the tomato in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. Such juice may be homogenized, may be seasoned with salt, and may be acidified with any safe and suitable organic acid. The juice may have been concentrated and later reconstituted with water and/or tomato juice to a tomato soluble solids content of not less than 5.0 percent by weight as determined by the method prescribed in § 156.3(b). The food is preserved by heat sterilization (canning), refrigeration, or freezing. When sealed in a container to be held at ambient temperatures, it is so processed by heat, before or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> (i) The name of the food is:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) “Tomato juice” if it is prepared from unconcentrated undiluted liquid extracted from mature tomatoes of reddish varieties.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) “Tomato juice from concentrate” if the finished juice has been prepared from concentrated tomato juice as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or if the finished juice is a mixture of tomato juice and tomato juice from concentrate.</P>
              <P>(ii) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for tomato juice is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) The strength and redness of color is not less than the composite color produced by spinning the Munsell color discs in the following combination: 53 percent of the area of Disc 1; 28 percent of the area of Disc 2; and 19 percent of the area of either Disc 3 or Disc 4; or 9<FR>1/2</FR> percent of the area of Disc 3 and 9<FR>1/2</FR> percent of the area of Disc 4, whichever most nearly matches the appearance of the tomato juice.</P>
              <P>(ii) Not more than two defects for peel and blemishes, either singly or in combination, in addition to three defects for seeds or pieces of seeds, defined as follows, per 500 milliliters (16.9 fluid ounces):</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) Pieces of peel 3.2 millimeters (0.125 inch) or greater in length.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Blemishes such as dark brown or black particles (specks) greater than 1.6 millimeters (0.0625 inch) in length.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) Seeds or pieces of seeds 3.2 millimeters (0.125 inch) or greater in length.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Methodology.</E> (i) Determine strength and redness of color as specified in § 156.3(a).</P>

              <P>(ii) Examine a total of 500 milliliters for peel, blemishes, and seeds. Divide the 500-milliliter sample into two 250-<PRTPAGE P="668"/>milliliter aliquots and pour each aliquot onto separate 30.5 × 45.7 centimeters (12 × 18 inches) white grading trays. Remove defects and evaluate for color and size as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</P>
              <P>(3) Determine compliance as specified in § 156.3(d).</P>
              <P>(4) If the quality of the tomato juice falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) and (3) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in § 130.14(a) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified, but in lieu of such general statement of substandard quality when the quality of the tomato juice falls below the standard in one or more respects, the label may bear the alternative statement, “Below Standard in Quality ___”, the blank to be filled in with the words specified after the corresponding paragraph (s) under paragraph (b)(1) of this section which such tomato juice fails to meet, as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) “Poor color”.</P>
              <P>(ii)(<E T="03">a</E>) “Excessive pieces of peel”.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) “Excessive blemishes”.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) “Excessive seeds” or “excessive pieces of seed”.</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of container for tomato juice, as determined by the general method for fill of container prescribed in § 130.12(b) of this chapter, is not less than 90 percent of the total capacity, except when the food is frozen.</P>
              <P>(2) Determine compliance as specified in § 156.3(d).</P>
              <P>(3) If the tomato juice falls below the standard of fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein prescribed.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Product definition.</E> Frozen peas is the food in “package” form as that term is defined in § 1.20 of this chapter, prepared from the succulent seed of the pea plant of the species <E T="03">Pisum sativum</E> L. Any suitable variety of pea may be used. It is blanched, drained, and preserved by freezing in such a way that the range of temperature of maximum crystallization is passed quickly. The freezing process shall not be regarded as complete until the product temperature has reached −18 °C (0 °F) or lower at the thermal center, after thermal stabilization. Such food may contain one, or any combination of two or more, of the following safe and suitable optional ingredients:</P>

              <P>(3) <E T="03">Labeling.</E> The name of the product is “peas”. The term “early”, “June”, or “early June” shall precede or follow the name in the case of smooth-skin or substantially smooth-skin peas, such as Alaska-type peas. Where the peas are of sweet green wrinkled varieties, the name may include the designation “sweet”, “green”, “wrinkled”, or any combination thereof. The label shall contain the words “frozen” or “quick frozen”. The name of the food shall include a declaration of any flavoring that characterizes the product as specified in § 101.22 of this chapter and a declaration of any condiment such as spices and mint leaves that characterizes the product, e.g., “Spice added”. Where a statement of pea size is made, such statement shall indicate either the size designation as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the applicable sieve size. However, the optional descriptive words “petite” or “tiny” may be used in conjunction with the product name when an average of 80 percent or more of the peas will pass through a circular opening of a diameter of 8.75 mm (0.34 in) or less for sweet green wrinkled peas and 8.2 mm (0.32 in) for smooth-skin or substantially smooth-skin peas, such as Alaska-type peas.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> (1) The standard of quality for frozen peas is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Not more than 4 percent by weight blond peas, i.e., yellow or white but edible peas;</P>
              <P>(ii) Not more than 10 percent by weight blemished peas, i.e., slightly stained or spotted peas;</P>

              <P>(iii) Not more than 2 percent by weight seriously blemished peas, i.e., peas that are hard, shrivelled, spotted, discolored or otherwise blemished to an extent that the appearance or eating quality is seriously affected.<PRTPAGE P="670"/>
              </P>
              <P>(iv) Not more than 15 percent by weight pea fragments, i.e., portions of peas, separated or individual cotyledons, crushed, partial or broken cotyledons and loose skins, but excluding entire intact peas with skins detached;</P>
              <P>(v) Not more than 0.5 percent by weight, or more than 12 sq cm (2 sq in) in area, extraneous vegetable material, i.e., vine or leaf or pod material from the pea plant or other such material per sample unit as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.</P>
              <P>(vi) The sum of the pea material described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section shall not exceed 15 percent.</P>
              <P>(vii) For peas that meet the organoleptic and analytical characteristics of sweet green wrinkled varieties:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) The alcohol-insoluble solids may not be more than 19 percent based on the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) Not more than 15 percent by count of the peas may sink in a solution containing 16 percent salt by weight according to the brine flotation test set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section;</P>
              <P>(viii) For smooth-skin or substantially smooth-skin varieties the alcohol insoluble solids may not be more than 23 percent based on the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) The quality of a lot shall be considered acceptable when the number of defectives does not exceed the acceptance number in the sampling plans set forth in § 158.3(f).</P>

              <P>(2) The sample unit for determining compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section other than those of paragraphs (b)(1)(vii)(<E T="03">a</E>) and (b)(1)(viii) of this section, shall be 500 g (17.6 oz). For the determination of alcohol-insoluble solids as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the container may be the sample unit.</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Alcohol-insoluble solids determination.</E> (i) Extracting solutions:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) One hundred parts of ethanol denatured with five parts of methanol volume to volume (formula 3A denatured alcohol), or</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) A mixture of 95 parts of formula 3A denatured alcohol and five parts of isopropanol v/v.</P>

              <P>(ii) Eighty percent alcohol (8 liters of extracting solutions, specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) or (<E T="03">b</E>) of this section, diluted to 9.5 liters with water).</P>
              <P>(iii) Drying dish—a flat-bottom dish with a tight fitting cover.</P>
              <P>(iv) Drying oven—a properly ventilated oven thermostatically controlled at 100±2 °C.</P>

              <P>(v) Procedure—Transfer frozen contents of package to plastic bag; tie bag securely and immerse in water bath with continuous flow at room temperature. Avoid agitation of bag during thawing by using clamps or weights. When sample completely thaws, remove bag, blot off adhering water, and transfer peas to U.S. No. 8 sieve, using (20 cm.) size for container of less than 3 lb. net weight and (30.5 cm.) for larger quantities. Without shifting peas, incline sieve to aid drainage, drain 2 minutes. With cloth wipe surplus water from lower screen surface. Weigh 250 g. of peas into high-speed blender, add 250 g. of water and blend to smooth paste. For less than 250 g. sample, use entire sample with equal weight of water. Weight 20 g.±10 mg. of the paste into 250 ml. distillation flask, add 120 ml. of extracting solutions specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) (<E T="03">a</E>) or (<E T="03">b</E>) of this section, and reflux 30 minutes on steam or water bath or hotplate. Fit into a buchner funnel a filter paper of appropriate size (previously prepared by drying in flatbottom dish for 2 hours in drying oven, covering, cooling in desiccator, and weighing). Apply vacuum to buchner funnel and transfer contents of beaker so as to avoid running over edge of paper. Aspirate to dryness and wash material on filter with 80 percent alcohol until washings are clear and colorless. Transfer paper and alcohol-insoluble solids to drying dish used to prepare paper, dry uncovered for 2 hours in drying oven, cover, cool in desiccator, and weigh at once. From this weight deduct weight of dish, cover, and paper. Calculate percent by weight of alcohol-insoluble solids.</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Brine flotation test.</E> (i) Explanation—The brine flotation test utilizes salt solutions of various specific <PRTPAGE P="671"/>gravities to separate the peas according to maturity. The brine solutions are based on the percentage by weight of pure salt (NaCl) in solution at 20 °C. In making the test the brine solutions are standardized to the proper specific gravity equivalent to the specified “percent of salt solutions at 20 °C” by using a salometer spindle accurately calibrated at 20 °C. A 250 ml glass beaker or similar receptacle is filled with the brine solution to a depth of approximately 50 mm. The brine solution and sample (100 peas per container) must be at the same temperature and should closely approximate 20 °C.</P>
              <P>(ii) Procedure—After carefully removing the skins from the peas, place the peas into the solution. Pieces of peas and loose skins should not be used in making the brine flotation test. If cotyledons divide, use both cotyledons in the test and consider the two separated cotyledons as 1 pea; and, if an odd cotyledon sinks, consider it as one pea. Only peas that sink to the bottom of the receptacle within 10 seconds after immersion are counted as “peas that sink”.</P>
              <P>(5) If the quality of the frozen peas falls below the standard prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard quality specified in the Code of Federal Regulations but in lieu of the words prescribed in the second line of the rectangle the following words may be used where the frozen peas fall below the standard in only one respect: “Below standard in quality ___”, the blank to be filled in with the specific reason for substandard quality as listed in the standard.</P>

              <P>(a) The food dried egg whites, egg white solids, dried egg albumen, egg albumen solids is prepared by drying liquid egg whites conforming to the requirements of § 160.140 (or deviating from that section only by not being <E T="03">Salmonella</E> free). As a preliminary step to drying, the lysozyme and avidin contents may be reduced. If lysozyme and avidin levels are reduced, cation exchange resins regulated for use under § 173.25 of this chapter shall be used. As a further preliminary step to drying, the glucose content of the liquid egg whites is reduced by adjusting the pH, where necessary, with food-grade acid and by following one of the optional procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If the food is prepared from liquid egg whites conforming in all respects to the requirements of § 160.140, drying shall be done with such precautions that the finished food is free of viable <E T="03">Salmonella</E> microorganisms. If the food is prepared from liquid egg whites that are not <E T="03">Salmonella</E> free, the dried product shall be so treated by heat or otherwise as to render the finished food free of viable <E T="03">Salmonella</E> microorganisms. Dried egg whites may be powdered.</P>
              <P>(b) The optional glucose-removing procedures are:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Enzyme procedure.</E> A glucose-oxidase-catalase preparation and hydrogen peroxide solution are added to liquid egg whites.

              <SUBJECT>Declaration of quantity of contents on labels for canned oysters.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) For many years packers of canned oysters in the Gulf area of the United States have labeled their output with a declaration of the drained weight of oysters in the containers. Packers in other areas have marketed canned oysters with a declaration of the total weight of the contents of the container. Investigation reveals that under present-day practice consumers generally do not discard the liquid packing medium, but use it as a part of the food. Section 403(e)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the regulations thereunder require food in package form to bear an accurate label statement of the quantity of food in the container.</P>
              <P>(b) It is concluded that compliance with the label declaration of quantity of contents requirement will be met by an accurate declaration of the total weight of the contents of the can. The requirements of § 161.145(c), establishing a standard of fill of container for canned oysters and specifying the statement of substandard fill for those canned oysters failing to meet that standard remain unaffected by this interpretation.</P>

              <P>(a) Oysters, raw oysters, shucked oysters, are the class of foods each of which is obtained by shucking shell oysters and preparing them in accordance with the procedure prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section. The name of each such food is the name specified in the applicable definition and standard of identity prescribed in §§ 161.131 to 161.140, inclusive.<PRTPAGE P="677"/>
              </P>
              <P>(b) If water, or salt water containing less than 0.75 percent salt, is used in any vessel into which the oysters are shucked the combined volume of oysters and liquid when such oysters are emptied from such vessel is not less than four times the volume of such water or salt water. Any liquid accumulated with the oysters is removed. The oysters are washed, by blowing or otherwise, in water or salt water, or both. The total time that the oysters are in contact with water or salt water after leaving the shucker, including the time of washing, rinsing, and any other contact with water or salt water is not more than 30 minutes. In computing the time of contact with water or salt water, the length of time that oysters are in contact with water or salt water that is agitated by blowing or otherwise, shall be calculated at twice its actual length. Any period of time that oysters are in contact with salt water containing not less than 0.75 percent salt before contact with oysters, shall not be included in computing the time that the oysters are in contact with water or salt water. Before packing into the containers for shipment or other delivery for consumption the oysters are thoroughly drained and are packed without any added substance.</P>

              <P>(2) Water capacity of containers is determined by the general method provided in § 130.12(a) of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(3) Drained weight is determined by the following method: Keep the un-opened canned oyster container at a temperature of not less than 68° or more than 95 °Fahrenheit for at least 12 hours immediately preceding the determination. After opening, tilt the container so as to distribute its contents evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve which has been previously weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 8 inches if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 3 pounds, and 12 inches if such quantity is 3 pounds or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth under “2.38 mm (No. 8)” in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference.

Two minutes from the time drainage begins, weigh the sieve and the drained oysters. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the drained weight of the oysters.</P>
              <P>(4) If canned oysters fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter in the manner and form therein specified, followed by the statement, “A can of this size should contain ___ oz. of oysters. This can contains only ___ oz.”, the blanks being filled in with the applicable figures.</P>

              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill of transparent or nontransparent containers for canned wet pack shrimp is a fill such that the cut-out weight of shrimp taken from each container is not less than 60 percent of the weight of the water required to fill the container. The weight of the water required to fill the container is determined by the general method provided in § 130.12(a) of this chapter. Cut-out weight is determined by the following method: Keep the unopened canned shrimp container at a temperature of not less than 68° nor more than 75 °Fahrenheit for at least 12 hours immediately preceding the determination. After opening, distribute the shrimp evenly over the meshes of a circular sieve that has been previously weighed. The diameter of the sieve is 20.3 centimeters (8 inches) if the quantity of the contents of the container is less than 1.36 kilograms (3 pounds), and 30.5 centimeters (12 inches), if such quantity is 1.36 kilograms (3 pounds) or more. The bottom of the sieve is woven-wire cloth that complies with the specifications for such cloth set forth as a 2.38 mm (No. 8) sieve in the “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes” of the “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Allow the shrimp to drain for 2 minutes, measured from the moment the product is poured onto the sieve. Weigh the sieve and the drained shrimp. The weight so found, less the weight of the sieve, shall be considered to be the cut-out weight of the shrimp.</P>
              <P>(2) Sampling and acceptance procedure: A container that falls below the requirement for minimum fill prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is considered a “defective.” Determine compliance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section except that the sample unit shall be the entire contents of the container.</P>
              <P>(3) If canned wet pack shrimp in transparent or nontransparent containers falls below the applicable standard of fill of container prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill provided in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Frozen raw breaded shrimp.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Frozen raw breaded shrimp is the food prepared by coating one of the optional forms of shrimp specified in paragraph (c) of this section with safe and suitable batter and breading ingredients as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The food is frozen.</P>
              <P>(b) The food tests not less than 50 percent of shrimp material as determined by the method prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section, except that if the shrimp are composite units the method prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section is used.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">shrimp</E> means the tail portion of properly prepared shrimp of commercial species. Except for composite units, each shrimp unit is individually coated. The optional forms of shrimp are:</P>
              <P>(1) Fantail or butterfly: Prepared by splitting the shrimp; the shrimp are peeled, except that tail fins remain attached and the shell segment immediately adjacent to the tail fins may be left attached.</P>
              <P>(2) Butterfly, tail off: Prepared by splitting the shrimp; tail fins and all shell segments are removed.</P>
              <P>(3) Round: Round shrimp, not split; the shrimp are peeled, except that tail fins remain attached and the shell segment immediately adjacent to the tail fins may be left attached.</P>
              <P>(4) Round, tail off: Round shrimp, not split; tail fins and all shell segments are removed.</P>
              <P>(5) Pieces: Each unit consists of a piece or a part of a shrimp; tail fins and all shell segments are removed.</P>
              <P>(6) Composite units: Each unit consists of two or more whole shrimp or pieces of shrimp, or both, formed and pressed into composite units prior to coating; tail fins and all shell segments are removed; large composite units, prior to coating, may be cut into smaller units.</P>
              <P>(d) The batter and breading ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are the fluid constituents and the solid constituents of the coating around the shrimp. These ingredients consist of suitable substances which are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act. Batter and breading ingredients that perform a useful function are regarded as suitable, except that artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, artificial colors, and chemical preservatives, other than those provided for in this paragraph, are not suitable ingredients of frozen raw breaded shrimp. Chemical preservatives that are suitable are:</P>
              <P>(1) Ascorbic acid, which may be used in a quantity sufficient to retard development of dark spots on the shrimp; and</P>

              <P>(2) The antioxidant preservatives listed in subpart D of part 182 of this <PRTPAGE P="684"/>chapter that may be used to retard development of rancidity of the fat content of the food, in amounts within the limits prescribed by that section.</P>
              <P>(e) The label shall name the food, as prepared from each of the optional forms of shrimp specified in paragraph (c) (1) to (6), inclusive, of this section, and following the numbered sequence of such subparagraph, as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) “Breaded fantail shrimp.” The word “butterfly” may be used in lieu of “fantail” in the name.</P>
              <P>(2) “Breaded butterfly shrimp, tail off.”</P>
              <P>(3) “Breaded round shrimp.”</P>
              <P>(4) “Breaded round shrimp, tail off.”</P>
              <P>(5) “Breaded shrimp pieces.”</P>
              <P>(6) Composite units:</P>
              <P>(i) If the composite units are in a shape similar to that of breaded fish sticks the name is “Breaded shrimp sticks”; if they are in the shape of meat cutlets, the name is “Breaded shrimp cutlets”.</P>

              <P>(ii) If prepared in a shape other than that of sticks or cutlets, the name is “Breaded shrimp ___”, the blank to be filled in with the word or phrase that accurately describes the shape, but which is not misleading.
              </P>
              <FP>In the case of the names specified in paragraphs (e) (1) through (5) of this section, the words in each name may be arranged in any order, provided they are so arranged as to be accurately descriptive of the food. The word “prawns” may be added in parentheses immediately after the word “shrimp” in the name of the food if the shrimp are of large size; for example, “Fantail breaded shrimp (prawns)”. If the shrimp are from a single geographical area, the adjectival designation of that area may appear as part of the name; for example, “Breaded Alaskan shrimp sticks”.</FP>
              <P>(f) The names of the optional ingredients used, as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, shall be listed on the principal display panel or panels of the label with such prominence and conspicuousness as to render them likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase. If a spice that also imparts color is used, it shall be designated as “spice and coloring”, unless the spice is designated by its specific name. If ascorbic acid is used to retard development of dark spots on the shrimp, it shall be designated as “Ascorbic acid added as a preservative” or “Ascorbic acid added to retard discoloration of shrimp”. If any other antioxidant preservative, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, is used, such preservative shall be designated by its common name followed by the statement “Added as a preservative”.</P>
              <P>(g) The method for determining percentage of shrimp material for those forms specified in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section is as follows:</P>

              <P>(2) <E T="03">Procedure.</E> (i) Weigh the sample to be debreaded. Fill the container three-fourths full of water at 70°-80 °F. Suspend the paddle in the container, leaving a clearance of at least 5 inches below the paddle vanes, and adjust <PRTPAGE P="685"/>speed to 120 r.p.m. Add shrimp and stir for 10 minutes. Stack the sieves, the <FR>1/2</FR>-inch mesh over the No. 20, and pour the contents of the container onto them. Set the sieves under a faucet, preferably with spray attached, and rinse shrimp with no rubbing of flesh, being careful to keep all rinsings over the sieves and not having the stream of water hit the shrimp on the sieve directly. Lay the shrimp out singly on the sieve as rinsed. Inspect each shrimp and use the rubber-tipped rod and the spray to remove the breading material that may remain on any of them, being careful to avoid undue pressure or rubbing, and return each shrimp to the sieve. Remove the top sieve and drain on a slope for 2 minutes, then remove the shrimp to weighing pan. Rinse contents of the No. 20 sieve onto a flat pan and collect any particles other than breading (i.e., flesh and tail fins) and add to shrimp on balance pan and weigh.</P>

                <P>Several preliminary trials may be necessary to determine the exact dip time required for “debreading” the composite units in a sample. For these trials only, a saturated solution of copper sulfate (1 pound of copper sulfate in 2 liters of tap water) is necessary. The correct dip time is the minimum time of immersion in the copper sulfate solution required before the breading can easily be scraped off: <E T="03">Provided,</E> That the “debreaded” units are still solidly frozen and only a slight trace of blue color is visible on the surface of the “debreaded” shrimp material.</P>

              <P>(7) For determination of the color designations specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the following method shall be used: Recombine the separations of pressed cake resulting from the method prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Pass the combined portions through a sieve fitted with woven-wire cloth of <FR>1/4</FR>-inch mesh complying with the specifications for such cloth set forth in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), Table 1, “Nominal Dimensions of Standard Test Sieves (U.S.A. Standard Series),” under the heading “Definitions of Terms and Explanatory Notes,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E> Mix the sieved material and place a sufficient quantity into a 307 × 113 size container (bearing a top seam and having a false bottom approximately <FR>1/2</FR>-inch deep and painted flat black inside and outside) so that <PRTPAGE P="688"/>after tamping and smoothing the surface of the sample the material will be <FR>1/8</FR>-inch to <FR>1/4</FR>-inch below the top of the container. Within 10 minutes after sieving through the <FR>1/4</FR>-inch mesh woven-wire cloth, determine the Munsell value of sample surface.</P>
              <P>(i) Determine the Munsell value of the sample surface so prepared. The following method may be used, employing an optical comparator, consisting of a lens and prism system which brings two beams of light, reflected from equal areas of sample surface and standard surface, respectively, together, within an eyepiece, so as to show an equally divided optical field. The scanned areas of sample and standard surface are not smaller than 2 square inches. Light reaching the eye is rendered sufficiently diffuse, by design of eyepiece and comparator, so that detail of the sample surface will remain undefined, to a degree such as to avoid visual confusion in observation of a match of over-all intensity of reflected light. The eyepiece contains a color filter centering at a wavelength between 550 mµ and 560 mµ. The filter does not pass appreciable visible radiation of wavelengths below 540 mµ or above 570 mµ. The passed wavelength band is of a monochromaticity sufficient to cause a sample and a neutral standard of equal reflectance to appear of the same hue. The comparator is rigidly mounted on a vertical stand attached to a base in which arrangement is provided for securely and accurately positioning two cans of size 307 × 113 in the two fields of view. Mounted on the base are two shaded lamps, which direct the center of their beams of light at about a 45° angle to the plane of the sample and standard surfaces. The lamps are so positioned that light from one bears mainly upon the sample surface and light from the other mainly on the standard surface, and are so placed in relation to sample and standard that no shadows, as from the can rims, appear in the fields of view. The lamps are strong enough to furnish adequate and convenient illumination through eyepiece and filter. Means are provided to alter the light intensity of one lamp in relation to the other, as may conveniently be achieved by using a 100-watt tungsten filament bulb in one lamp and using, in the other, a similar 150-watt bulb connected with the power source through a suitable rheostat. The stand is equipped with non-glossy black curtains on the side of the observer, to exclude variation in extraneous light reflected from the person of the observer.</P>
              <P>(ii) To adjust the comparator, place a pair of matte surface standards of Munsell value 5.3, mounted as described in paragraph (a)(7)(iv) of this section, in position in the comparator base, and adjust the intensity of the variable lamp until the two halves of the optical field, viewed through the eyepiece, are of equal brightness. Then remove one of the standards and replace it with the prepared sample. Without altering any other adjustments, observe through the eyepiece whether the sample appears lighter or darker than the standard. In case of examination of albacore designated “white”, conduct the procedure using standards of Munsell value 6.3.</P>

              <P>(iii) The standards with which comparisons are made are essentially neutral matte-finish standards, equivalent in luminous reflectance of light of 555µ wavelength to 33.7 percent of the luminous reflectance of magnesium oxide (for Munsell value 6.3) and 22.6 percent of the luminous reflectance of magnesium oxide (for Munsell value 5.3), as given by the relationship between Munsell value and luminous reflectance derived by a subcommittee of the Optical Society of America and published in the “Journal of the Optical Society of America,” Vol. 33, page 406 (1943), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS-150), Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              </P>

              <P>(iv) These standards shall be cut in circles 3<FR>1/4</FR> inches in diameter and shall be mounted in 307 × 113 size containers, bearing a top seam and painted flat <PRTPAGE P="689"/>black inside and outside, so that the surfaces of the standards are <FR>3/16</FR> inch below the top of the containers in which they are mounted.</P>
              <P>(v) In the case of blended tuna, the foregoing method shall be varied by first separating the tuna flakes of the two different colors before passing them through the <FR>1/4</FR>-inch mesh sieve, then proceeding with each portion separately for the determination of its color value, employing, if necessary, a sample container with false bottom greater than <FR>1/2</FR> inch deep.</P>
              <P>(8)(i) The specified names of the canned tuna for which definitions and standards of identity are prescribed by this section, except where water is the packing medium or where the tuna is smoked, are formed by combining the designation of form of pack with the color designation of the tuna; for example, “Solid pack white tuna”, “Grated dark tuna”, etc. In the case of blended tuna, there shall be used both applicable color designations of the blended flakes, in precedence determined in accordance with the predominating portion found in the container; for example, “Blended white and dark tuna flakes”, “Blended dark and light tuna flakes”.</P>
              <P>(ii) The specified name of canned tuna when water is used as the packing medium is formed as described in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, followed by the words “in water”; for example, “Grated light tuna in water”.</P>
              <P>(iii) When the packing medium is vegetable oil or olive oil, the label shall bear the name of the optional packing medium used, as specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, preceded by the word “in” or the words “packed in”. In case of the optional ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the name or names of the oil used may be stated, or the general term “vegetable oil” may be used.</P>
              <P>(iv) In case solid pack tuna is packed in olive oil, the designation “Tonno” may also appear.</P>
              <P>(v) In case any of the specified forms of canned tuna are smoked, the word “smoked” shall appear as a part of the name on the label; for example, “Smoked light tuna flakes”.</P>
              <P>(vi) Where the canned tuna contains one or more of the ingredients provided for in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the label shall bear the statement “Seasoned with ___”, the blank being filled in with the name or names of the ingredient or ingredients used, except that if the ingredient designated in paragraph (a)(6)(v) of this section is used, the blank shall be filled in with the term “vegetable broth”, and if the ingredients designated in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section are used, the blank may be filled in with the term “oil”, and if the ingredient designated in paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this section is used alone, the label may alternatively bear either the statement “spiced” or the statement “with added spice”; and if salt is the only seasoning ingredient used, the label may alternatively bear any of the statements “salted”, “with added salt”, or “salt added”. If the flavoring ingredients designated in paragraph (a)(6)(vii) of this section are used, the words “lemon flavored” or “with lemon flavoring” shall appear as part of the name on the label; for example, “lemon flavored chunk light tuna”. Citric acid and any optional solubilizing and dispersing agent used as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(vii) of this section in connection with lemon flavoring ingredients or emulsifying and suspending ingredients used as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section shall be designated on the label by their common or usual name.</P>
              <P>(vii) Where the canned tuna contains the optional ingredient sodium acid pyrophosphate as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the statement “pyrophosphate added” or “with added pyrophosphate”.</P>

              <P>(viii) Wherever the name of the food appears on the label so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the names of the optional ingredients used, as specified in paragraphs (a)(8)(iii), (vi), and (vii) of this section (except if lemon flavoring is added, this subparagraph applies only to the terms “lemon flavored” or “with lemon flavoring”, not to the constituent ingredients of that flavoring or to any optional solubilizing or dispersing ingredient used in connection with lemon flavoring ingredients), shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such name <PRTPAGE P="690"/>without intervening, written, printed, or graphic matter except that the common name of the species of tuna fish may so intervene; but the species name “albacore” may be employed only for canned tuna of that species which meets the color designation “white” as prescribed by paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.</P>
              <P>(ix) Statements of optional ingredients present required by paragraph (a)(8)(vi) of this section, but not subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(8)(viii) of this section shall be set forth on the label with such prominence and conspicuousness as to render them likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase.</P>

              <FP>If the can size in question is not listed, calculate the value for column II as follows: From the list select as the comparable can size that one having nearest the water capacity of the can size in question, multiply the value listed in column II for the same form of tuna ingredient by the water capacity of the can size in question, and divided by the water capacity of the comparable can size. Water capacities are determined by the general method provided in § 130.12(a) of this chapter. For the purposes of this section, cans of dimensions 211 × 109 shall be deemed to have a water capacity at 68 °F of 3.55 avoirdupois ounces of water; cans of dimensions 307 × 113, a water capacity of 7.05 avoirdupois ounces of water; cans of dimensions 401 × 206, a water capacity of 13.80 avoirdupois ounces of water; and cans of dimensions 603 × 408, a water capacity of 68.15 avoirdupois ounces of water.</FP>
              <P>(2) The methods referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for determining the weight of the pressed cake and referred to in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section for determining the percent of free flakes and the percent of pieces that pass through a <FR>1/2</FR>-inch-mesh sieve are as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) Have each of the 24 cans and contents at a temperature of 75 °F within ±5 °F. Test each can in turn as follows:</P>
              <P>(ii) Cut out the top of the can (code end), using a can opener that does not remove nor distort the double seam.</P>
              <P>(iii) With the cut top held on the can contents, invert the can, and drain the free liquid by gentle finger pressure on the cut lid so that most of the free liquid drains from the can.</P>
              <P>(iv) With the cut lid still in place, cut out the bottom of the can with the can opener, then turn the can upright and remove the cut can top (code end). Scrape off any adhering tuna particles into the tuna mass in the can.</P>
              <P>(v) Place the proper size of press cylinder as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section in a horizontal position on a table; then, using the cut bottom of the can as a pusher, gently force the can contents from the can into the cylinder so that the flat side of the can contents lies in contact with the bottom of the cylinder. Remove the bottom of the can that was used as the pusher and scrape any adhering particles from the can body and bottom of the can, and put them in the cylinder.</P>

              <P>(vi) Place the cylinder plunger on top of the can contents in the cylinder. Remove the eyebolt and put the cylinder <PRTPAGE P="691"/>and plunger in position on the press (paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section).</P>
              <P>(vii) Begin the operation of the press and as soon as liquid is observed coming from the cylinder start timing the operation. Apply pressure to the plunger slowly and at a uniform rate, so that a full minute is used to reach a pressure of 384 pounds per square inch of plunger face in contact with the can contents. Hold this pressure for 1 additional minute and then release the pressure and disengage the plunger from the press shaft. Tip the press cylinder so that any free liquid is drained out.</P>
              <P>(viii) Remove press cylinder with plunger from the press, insert eyebolt in plunger and withdraw it from the cylinder. Loosen the pressed cake from the cylinder with a thin blade and remove the entire pressed cake as gently as possible, to keep the mass in a single cake during this operation. Place the pressed cake and any pieces that adhered to the plunger and cylinder in a tared receiving pan and determine the weight of the pressed material.</P>
              <P>(ix) For cans larger than 401 × 206, cut out the top of the can and drain off free liquid from the can contents as in operations described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. Determine the gross weight of the can and remaining contents. Using a tared core cutter as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, cut vertically a core of the drained material in the can. Determine the weight of the core. With a thin spatula transfer the core to the pressing cylinder for 401 × 206 cans. Determine the weight of the pressed cake as in the operations described in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) through (viii) of this section. Remove the remaining drained contents of the can, reserving the contents for the determination of free flakes (paragraph (c)(2)(xi) of this section), weigh the empty can, and calculate the weight of the total drained material. Calculate the weight of pressed cake on the entire can basis by multiplying the weight of the pressed cake of the core by the ratio of the weight of the drained contents of the can to the weight of the core before pressing.</P>
              <P>(x) Repeat the determination of weight of pressed cake on the remainder of the 24 cans and determine the average weight of pressed cake for the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</P>
              <P>(xi) Determination of free flakes: If the optional form of tuna ingredient is solid pack, determine the percent of free flakes. Any flakes resulting from the operations described in this paragraph (c)(2)(xi) or in other parts of this paragraph are to be weighed as free flakes. Only fragments that were broken in the canning procedure are considered to be free flakes. If the can is of such size that its entire drained contents were pressed as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) to (viii) of this section, inclusive, examine the pressed cake carefully for free flakes. Using a spatula, scrape free flakes gently from the outside of the cake. Weigh the aggregate free flakes that were broken from the loin segments in the canning procedure and calculate their percentage of the total weight of pressed cake. If the can is of such size that a core was cut for pressing as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ix) of this section, make the examination for free flakes on a weighed portion of the drained material remaining after the core was removed. The weight of the portion examined should approximately equal the weight of the core before pressing. Calculate the weight of the free flakes that were broken from the loins in the canning procedure as a percentage of the weight of the portion examined.</P>

              <P>(xii) Determination of particle size: If the optional form of tuna ingredient is chunks, flakes, or grated, the pressed cake resulting from the operations described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) to (ix) of this section, inclusive, is gently separated by hand, care being taken to avoid breaking the pieces. The separated pieces are evenly distributed over the top sieve of the screen separation equipment described in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. Beginning with the top sieve, lift and drop each sieve by its open edge three times. Each time, the open edge of the sieve is lifted the full distance permitted by the device. Combine and weigh the material remaining on the three top sieves (1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch, 1-inch, <FR>1/2</FR>-inch screens), and determine the combined <PRTPAGE P="692"/>percentage retention by weight in relation to the total weight of the pressed cake.</P>

              <P>(3)(i) The press cylinder and plunger referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are made of stainless steel. The press cylinders are made with a lip to facilitate drainage of the liquid. Plungers have a threaded center hole, about half as deep as the thickness of the plunger, for receiving a ringbolt to assist in removing the plunger from the press cylinder. Dimensions for press cylinders and plungers are as follows:

              <SUBJECT>Mixed nuts.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a) Mixed nuts is the food consisting of a mixture of four or more of the optional shelled tree nut ingredients, with or without one or more of the optional shelled peanut ingredients, of the kinds prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section; except that when 2 ounces or less of the food is packed in transparent containers, three or more of the optional tree nut ingredients shall be present. Each such kind of nut ingredient when used shall be present in a quantity not less than 2 percent and not more than 80 percent by weight of the finished food. For purposes of this section, each kind of tree nut and peanut is an optional ingredient that may be prepared by any suitable method in accordance with good manufacturing practice. The finished food may contain one or more of the optional nonnut ingredients provided for in paragraph (c) of this section.</P>
              <P>(b) The optional shelled nut ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:</P>
              <P>(1) Almonds, black walnuts, Brazil nuts, cashews, English walnuts (alternatively “walnuts”), filberts, pecans, and other suitable kinds of tree nuts.</P>
              <P>(2) Peanuts of the Spanish, Valencia, Virginia, or similar varieties, or any combination of two or more such varieties.</P>
              <P>(c) The optional nonnut ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section consist of suitable substances that are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act. Nonnut ingredients that perform a useful function are regarded as suitable, except that color additives are not suitable ingredients of the food.</P>

              <P>(d) The name of the food is “mixed nuts”. If the percentage of a single tree <PRTPAGE P="702"/>nut ingredient or the total peanut content by weight of the finished food exceeds 50 percent but not 60 percent, the statement “contains up to 60% ___” or “contains 60% ___” or “60% ___” shall immediately follow the name “mixed nuts” and shall appear on the same background, be of the same color or, in the case of multicolors, in the color showing distinct contrast with the background, and be in letters not less than one-half the height of the largest letter in the words “mixed nuts”. The blank is to be filled in with the appropriate name of the predominant nut ingredient; for example, “contains up to 60% pecans” or “contains up to 60% Spanish peanuts”. The numbers “70” or “80” shall be substituted for the number “60” when the percentage of the predominant nut ingredient exceeds 60 but not 70, or exceeds 70 but not 80, respectively. Compliance with the requirements for percentage of nut ingredients of this section and the fill of container requirements of § 164.120(c) will be determined by the following procedure:</P>
              <P>(1) Take at random from a lot, in the case of containers bearing a weight declaration of 16 ounces or less, at least 24 containers, and for containers bearing a weight declaration of more than 16 ounces, enough containers to provide a total quantity of at least 24 pounds of nuts.</P>
              <P>(2) If compliance with § 164.120(c) is to be determined, first follow the procedure set forth therein.</P>
              <P>(3) Determine the percent by weight of each nut ingredient present in each container separately. Calculate the average percentage of each nut ingredient present. If the average percent found for each nut ingredient present is 2 percent or more and none of the individual nut ingredients exceeds 80 percent by weight of the finished food, the lot will be deemed to be in compliance with the percentage requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. If the average percent found for a single nut ingredient exceeds 50 percent by weight of the finished food and the average percent found is within the range indicated by the number declared on the label in accordance with this paragraph, the lot will be deemed to be in compliance with the labeling requirements of this paragraph.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter, except that:</P>
              <P>(1) If the Spanish variety of peanuts is used, it shall be declared as “Spanish peanuts”. Other varieties of peanuts shall be declared as “peanuts”, or alternatively “___ peanuts”, the blank being filled in with the varietal name of the peanuts used.</P>
              <P>(2) If the peanut ingredient or ingredients as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are unblanched, the label shall show that fact by such statement as “Peanuts unblanched”, “Peanuts skins on”, or words of similar import, unless the vignette clearly depicts peanuts with skins on.</P>
              <P>(f) The words and statements specified in paragraph (e) of this section showing the ingredients present shall be listed on the principal display panel or panels or any appropriate information panel without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible letters of boldface print or type the size of which shall be not less than one-half of that required by part 101 of this chapter for the statement of net quantity of contents appearing on the label, but in no case less than one-sixteenth of an inch in height. The entire ingredient statement shall appear on at least one panel of the label. If the label bears any pictorial representation of the mixture of nuts, it shall depict the relative proportions of the nut ingredients of the food. If the label bears a pictorial representation of only one of each nut ingredient present, the nuts shall be depicted in the order of decreasing predominance by weight. A factual statement that the food does not contain a particular nut ingredient or ingredients may be shown on the label if the statement is not misleading and does not result in an insufficiency of label space for the proper declaration of information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the label.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Shelled nuts in rigid or semirigid containers.</SUBJECT>
              <P>(a)-(b) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(c) <E T="03">Fill of container.</E> (1) The standard of fill for shelled nuts in rigid or semirigid containers is a fill such that the average volume of nuts, from the number of containers specified in § 164.110(d)(1), is not less than 85 percent of the container volume as determined by the method in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</P>
              <P>(2) The method for determining the percent of fill is as follows:</P>
              <P>(i) For the shelled nuts in each container, determine the loose volume, the settled volume, and the average volume in cubic centimeters. For the purposes of this subparagraph, consider volume in milliliters to be numerically equal to volume in cubic centimeters. Open the container and pour the nuts loosely into a vertical graduated cylinder (do not tilt) of appropriate size fitted with a funnel which has been modified, if necessary, to provide a minimum opening of 1<FR>1/2</FR>-inch diameter. (If the loose volume of the nuts is less than 500 milliliters, use a 500-milliliter cylinder with an inside diameter of approximately 1<FR>7/8</FR> inches; but if the loose volume is 500 milliliters or more, use a 1,000-milliliter cylinder with an inside diameter of approximately 2<FR>1/4</FR> inches.) Without shaking the cylinder, estimate the location of a horizontal plane representing the average height of the product, read the volume of the nuts, and record as the loose volume. Raise the cylinder 2 inches and allow it a free vertical drop onto a level, firm, but resilient surface (do not tamp) for a total of 5 times and observe the volume as above. Repeat in successive five-drop increments until the nuts have so settled that the volume decreases less than 2 percent in the last five-drop increment. Read the last volume in the manner described above and record as the settled volume. The arithmetical average of the loose volume and the settled volume equals the average volume of nuts.</P>
              <P>(ii) Classify the container by shape and determine its volume in cubic centimeters according to one of the following methods as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">a</E>) For containers of irregular shape, including glass jars, follow the general method for water capacity of containers as prescribed in § 130.12(a) of this chapter and determine the container volume, considering the water capacity in grams to be numerically equivalent to volume in cubic centimeters, or the water capacity in ounces (avoirdupois) to be equivalent to 28.35 cubic centimeters per ounce.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">b</E>) For box-shaped containers (that is, with opposite sides parallel), measure the inside height, width, and depth and calculate the volume as the product of these three dimensions. For such containers used to enclose vacuum packs and containing 4 ounces or less of the product, consider the height to be the inside height minus three-eighths inch.</P>
              <P>(<E T="03">c</E>) For cylindrical containers, calculate the container volume in cubic centimeters as the product of the height times the square of the diameter, both measured in inches, times 12.87; or as the product of the height times the square of the diameter, both measured in centimeters, times 0.7854. For containers that do not have indented ends, use the inside height and inside diameter as the dimensions. For metal cans with indented ends (that is, metal cans with ends attached by double seams), consider the height to be the outside height at the double seam minus three-eighths inch (0.953 centimeter) and the diameter to be the outside diameter at the double seam minus one-eighth inch (0.318 centimeter). For fiber-bodied containers with indented ends (that is, fiber-bodied cans with metal ends attached by double seams), consider the height to be the outside height at the double seam minus three-eighths inch (0.953 centimeter) and the diameter to be the outside diameter at the double seam minus three-sixteenths inch (0.476 centimeter).</P>
              <P>(iii) Calculate the percent fill of the container as follows: Divide the average volume of nuts found according to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section by the appropriate container volume found according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section and multiply by 100. The result shall be considered to be the percent fill of the container.</P>

              <P>(3) If shelled nuts fall below the standard of fill of container prescribed <PRTPAGE P="704"/>in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the label shall bear the general statement of substandard fill specified in § 130.14(b) of this chapter, in the manner and form therein specified.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Peanut butter.</SUBJECT>

              <P>(a) Peanut butter is the food prepared by grinding one of the shelled and roasted peanut ingredients provided for by paragraph (b) of this section, to which may be added safe and suitable seasoning and stabilizing ingredients provided for by paragraph (c) of this section, but such seasoning and stabilizing ingredients do not in the aggregate exceed 10 percent of the weight of the finished food. To the ground peanuts, cut or chopped, shelled, and roasted peanuts may be added. During processing, the oil content of the peanut ingredient may be adjusted by the addition or subtraction of peanut oil. The fat content of the finished food shall not exceed 55 percent when determined as prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), section 27.006(a) under “Crude Fat—Official First Action, Direct Method,” in paragraph (a), which is incorporated by reference.

              </P>
              <P>(b) The peanut ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:</P>
              <P>(1) Blanched peanuts, in which the germ may or may not be included.</P>
              <P>(2) Unblanched peanuts, including the skins and germ.</P>
              <P>(c) The seasoning and stabilizing ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are suitable substances which are not food additives as defined in section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), or if they are food additives as so defined, they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 of the act. Seasoning and stabilizing ingredients that perform a useful function are regarded as suitable, except that artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, chemical preservatives, and color additives are not suitable ingredients in peanut butter. Oil products used as optional stabilizing ingredients shall be hydrogenated vegetable oils. For the purposes of this section, hydrogenated vegetable oil shall be considered to include partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.</P>
              <P>(d) If peanut butter is prepared from unblanched peanuts as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the name shall show that fact by some such statement as “prepared from unblanched peanuts (skins left on).” Such statement shall appear prominently and conspicuously and shall be in type of the same style and not less than half of the point size of that used for the words “peanut butter.” This statement shall immediately precede or follow the words “peanut butter,” without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter.</P>
              <P>(e) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>

              <P>(a) <E T="03">Identity</E>—(1) <E T="03">Description.</E> Bottled water is water that is intended for human consumption and that is sealed in bottles or other containers with no added ingredients except that it may optionally contain safe and suitable antimicrobial agents. Fluoride may be optionally added within the limitations established in § 165.110(b)(4)(ii). Bottled water may be used as an ingredient in beverages (e.g., diluted juices, flavored bottled waters). It does not include those food ingredients that are declared in ingredient labeling as “water,” “carbonated water,” “disinfected water,” “filtered water,” “seltzer water,” “soda water,” “sparkling water,” and “tonic water.” The processing and bottling of bottled water shall comply with applicable regulations in part 129 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(2) <E T="03">Nomenclature.</E> The name of the food is “bottled water,” “drinking water,” or alternatively one or more of the following terms as appropriate:</P>
              <P>(i) The name of water from a well tapping a confined aquifer in which the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer is “artesian water” or “artesian well water.” Artesian water may be collected with the assistance of external force to enhance the natural underground pressure. On request, plants shall demonstrate to appropriate regulatory officials that the water level stands at some height above the top of the aquifer.</P>
              <P>(ii) The name of water from a subsurface saturated zone that is under a pressure equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure is “ground water.” Ground water must not be under the direct influence of surface water as defined in 40 CFR 141.2.</P>
              <P>(iii) The name of water containing not less than 250 parts per million (ppm) total dissolved solids (TDS), coming from a source tapped at one or more bore holes or springs, originating from a geologically and physically protected underground water source, may be “mineral water.” Mineral water shall be distinguished from other types of water by its constant level and relative proportions of minerals and trace elements at the point of emergence from the source, due account being taken of the cycles of natural fluctuations. No minerals may be added to this water.</P>

              <P>(iv) The name of water that has been produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other suitable processes and that meets the definition of “purified water” in the United States Pharmacopeia, 23d Revision, January 1, 1995, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 551(a) and 1 CFR part 51. (Copies may be obtained from the United States Pharmacopial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Pkwy., Rockville, MD 20852 and may be examined at the Food and Drug Administration's Main Library, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 2, Third Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20993, 301-796-2039, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(v) The name of water that, after treatment and possible replacement of carbon dioxide, contains the same amount of carbon dioxide from the source that it had at emergence from the source may be “sparkling bottled water.”</P>
              <P>(vi) The name of water derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth may be “spring water.” Spring water shall be collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. There shall be a natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice. The location of the spring shall be identified. Spring water collected with the use of an external force shall be from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth. If spring water is collected with the use of an external force, water must continue to flow naturally to the surface of the earth through the spring's natural orifice. Plants shall demonstrate, on request, to appropriate regulatory officials, using a hydrogeologically valid method, that an appropriate hydraulic connection exists between the natural orifice of the spring and the bore hole.</P>

              <P>(vii) The name of water that meets the requirements under “Sterility Tests” &lt;71&gt;in the United States Pharmacopeia, 23d Revision, January 1, 1995, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR 51. (Copies may be obtained from the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., 12601 Twinbrook Pkwy., Rockville, MD 20852 and may be examined at the Food and Drug Administration's Main Library, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 2, Third Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20993, 301-796-2039, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

              <P>(viii) The name of water from a hole bored, drilled, or otherwise constructed in the ground which taps the water of an aquifer may be “well water.”</P>
              <P>(3) <E T="03">Other label statements.</E> (i) If the TDS content of mineral water is below 500 ppm, or if it is greater than 1,500 ppm, the statement “low mineral content” or the statement “high mineral content”, respectively, shall appear on the principal display panel following the statement of identity in type size at least one-half the size of the statement of identity but in no case of less than one-sixteenth of an inch. If the TDS of mineral water is between 500 and 1,500 ppm, no additional statement need appear.</P>
              <P>(ii) When bottled water comes from a community water system, as defined in 40 CFR 141.2, except when it has been treated to meet the definitions in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (a)(2)(vii) of this section and is labeled as such, the label shall state “from a community water system” or, alternatively, “from a municipal source” as appropriate, on the principal display panel or panels. This statement shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow the name of the food without intervening written, printed, or graphic matter, other than statements required by paragraph (c) of this section, in type size at least one-half the size of the statement of identity but in no case of less than one-sixteenth of an inch.</P>

              <P>(iii) When the label or labeling of a bottled water product states or implies (e.g., through label statements or vignettes with references to infants) that the bottled water is for use in feeding infants, and the product is not commercially sterile under § 113.3(e)(3)(i) of this chapter, the product's label shall <PRTPAGE P="707"/>bear conspicuously and on the principal display panel the statement “Not sterile. Use as directed by physician or by labeling directions for use of infant formula.”</P>
              <P>(4) <E T="03">Label declaration.</E> Each of the ingredients used in the food shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.</P>
              <P>(b) <E T="03">Quality.</E> The standard of quality for bottled water, including water for use as an ingredient in beverages (except those described in the labeling as “water,” “carbonated water,” “disinfected water,” “filtered water,” “seltzer water,” “soda water,” “sparkling water,” and “tonic water”), is as follows:</P>
              <P>(1) <E T="03">Definitions.</E> (i) <E T="03">Trihalomethane</E> (THM) means one of the family of organic compounds, named as derivatives of methane, wherein three of the four hydrogen atoms in methane are each substituted by a halogen atom in the molecular structure.</P>

              <SUBJECT>Labeling of margarine.</SUBJECT>
              <P>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended by Pub. L. 459, 81st Congress (64 Stat. 20) on colored oleomargarine or margarine by adding thereto a new section numbered 407. Among other things, this section requires that there appear on the label of the package the word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” in type or lettering at least as large as any other type or lettering on the label, and a full and accurate statement of all the ingredients contained in such oleomargarine or margarine. It provides that these requirements “shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any of the other requirements of this Act”.</P>
              <P>(a) Under section 403(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, any article that is represented as or purports to be oleomargarine or margarine must conform to the definition and standard of identity for oleomargarine or margarine promulgated under section 401 of the act (Subpart B of this part), and its label must bear the name “oleomargarine” or “margarine”.</P>
              <P>(b) The identity standard for oleomargarine or margarine applies to both the uncolored and the colored article.</P>
              <P>(c) In considering the requirement that the word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” be in type or lettering at least as large as any other type or lettering on the label, it must be borne in mind that at least three factors are involved—the height of each letter, the area occupied by each letter as measured by a closely fitting rectangle drawn around it, and the boldness of letters or breadth of the lines forming the letters. The type or lettering used should meet the following tests:</P>
              <P>(1) The height of each letter in the word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” should equal or exceed the height of any other letter elsewhere on the label.</P>
              <P>(2) The area of the closely fitting rectangle with respect to any of the letters in the word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” should equal or exceed the area of such rectangle applied to the same or a corresponding letter elsewhere on the label.</P>
              <P>(3) The letters in the word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” should be equal to or exceed in prominence and boldness, such as breadth of lines forming the letters, the same or corresponding letters elsewhere on the label.</P>
              <P>(d) [Reserved]</P>
              <P>(e) The word “oleomargarine” or “margarine” (and thus the other information called for by the statute) should appear on each panel of the package label that might reasonably be selected by the grocer for display purposes at the point of sale.</P>

              <P>(f) The amendment covering colored oleomargarine or colored margarine states that, “for the purposes of * * * section 407 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the term ‘oleomargarine’ or ‘margarine’ includes: (1) All substances, mixtures, <PRTPAGE P="725"/>and compounds known as oleomargarine or margarine; (2) all substances, mixtures, and compounds which have a consistency similar to that of butter and which contain any edible oils or fats other than milk fat if made in imitation or semblance of butter”. Notwithstanding the difference between this definition and the definition and standard of identity for oleomargarine or margarine promulgated under section 401 of the act, it was the clear intent of Congress that any article which is represented as or purports to be oleomargarine or margarine is misbranded if it fails to comply with the definition and standard of identity for oleomargarine or margarine even though it may meet the statutory definition.</P>
              <P>(g) Section 407(a) states that “Colored oleomargarine or colored margarine which is sold in the same State or Territory in which it is produced shall be subject in the same manner and to the same extent to the provisions of this act as if it had been introduced in interstate commerce”.</P>
              <P>(h) Section 407(b)(4) requires that each part of the contents of the package be “contained in a wrapper which bears the word ‘oleomargarine’ or ‘margarine’ in type or lettering not smaller than 20-point type”. The Food and Drug Administration interprets this to mean that the height of the actual letters is no less than 20 points, or <FR>20/72</FR> of 1 inch.</P>
              <P>(i) The wrappers on the subdivisions of oleomargarine or margarine contained within the package sold at retail are labels within the meaning of section 201(k) and shall contain all of the label information required by sections 403 and 407 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, just as in the case of 1-pound cartons, except that wrappers on the subdivisions contained within the retail package shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of section 403 (e)(1), (g)(2), (i)(2), and (k) of the act with respect to the requirements for label declaration of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor and label declaration of ingredients when (1) the subdivisions are securely enclosed within and are not intended to be separated from the retail package under conditions of retail sale; (2) the wrappers on the subdivisions are labeled with the statement “This Unit Not Labeled For Retail Sale” in type size not less than one-sixteenth inch in height. The word “Individual” may be used in lieu of or immediately preceding the word “Retail” in the statement.</P>

              <P>(a) The term <E T="03">vanilla beans</E> means the properly cured and dried fruit pods of <E T="03">Vanilla planifolia Andrews</E> and of <E T="03">Vanilla tahitensis Moore.</E>
              </P>
              <P>(b) The term <E T="03">unit weight of vanilla beans</E> means, in the case of vanilla beans containing not more than 25 percent moisture, 13.35 ounces of such beans; and, in the case of vanilla beans containing more than 25 percent moisture, it means the weight of such beans equivalent in content of moisture-free vanilla-bean solids to 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans containing 25 percent moisture. (For example, one unit weight of vanilla beans containing 33.25 percent moisture amounts to 15 ounces.) The moisture content of vanilla beans is determined by the method prescribed in “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” 13th Ed. (1980), sections 7.004 and 7.005, which is incorporated by reference, except that the toluene used is blended with 20 percent by volume of benzene and the total distillation time is 4 hours. Copies of the material incorporated by reference may be obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: <E T="03">http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/ code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</E> To prepare samples for analysis, the pods are chopped into pieces approximately <FR>1/4</FR>-inch in longest dimension, using care to avoid moisture change.</P>
              <P>(c) The term <E T="03">unit of vanilla constituent</E> means the total sapid and odorous principles extractable from one unit weight of vanilla beans, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, by an aqueous alcohol solution in which the content of ethyl alcohol by volume amounts to not less than 35 percent.</P>

In vanilla extract the content of ethyl alcohol is not less than 35 percent by volume and the content of vanilla constituent, as defined in § 169.3(c), is not less than one unit per gallon. The vanilla constituent may be extracted directly from vanilla beans or it may be added in the form of concentrated vanilla extract or concentrated vanilla flavoring or vanilla flavoring concentrated to the semisolid form called vanilla oleo-resin. Vanilla extract may contain one or more of the following optional ingredients:</P>
              <P>(1) Glycerin.</P>
              <P>(2) Propylene glycol.</P>
