## Data


### Policy

* [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/)

	- This is a platform that publishes all policy changes and regulations passed by the government in any shape or form. They come from through the Federal Register and are associated with a variety of government agencies. Each regulation has a HTM and JSON file. The HTM file contains the regulation in readable format whereas the JSON file contains metadata about the regulation. Some important information in the JSON files include the subject, topics, link to the PDF file, and posted date. 

* [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/cfr/2020/) \[[2019](https://github.com/GSA/AI_Grand_Challenge_For_Resiliency/tree/main/Data/CFR-2019) | [2020](https://github.com/GSA/AI_Grand_Challenge_For_Resiliency/tree/main/Data/CFR-2020)\]

	- CFR consists of all regulations passed by various executive entities of the federal government. They are divided up into 50 titles (subject areas), allowing competitors to view the impact of COVID-19 across different industries and sectors. The data is stored in a XML format.

* [Coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/)

	- [Search logs](https://github.com/GSA/AI_Grand_Challenge_For_Resiliency/blob/main/Data/Coronavirus.gov%20Search%20Logs-20210309T185408Z-001.zip) pulled from Coronavirus.gov may provide some insight into the questions the federal government received from the public at different stages of the pandemic.
